every update   we will optimize the game  useless updates trying to compete with fortnite instead of listening to our feedbackthis game needs a lot of optimization or it will go down hill like H1Z1,negative
PUBG feeds off the fame that it created With many problems of the base game still alive the developers still push the game out of the dark pit of early access Over time PUBG has lost appeal due to the lack of consistant gameplay Although I do like PUBG more than many other battle royal games it can t be stressed enough that this game has alot of contitionals so that it can be fun I would not recommend this game unless you have a group of friends who own it and extra cash,negative
This is a sloppy game and probably the worst 40 I ve spent I don t care how much  better  this is than fortnite it s nowhere near as polished and the developers apparently don t care about improving anything The glitchiness that can happen in mundane tasks like picking up weapons or moving around a house are absurd Save your money get something else,negative
This game is goodnt It is the big gae,negative
I mean its a good game but it isnt progressing the way it should I still believe there is hope for this game but bluehole needs to pull their big boy pants up and stop this fortnite lawsuit bs This game isnt going to compete with fortnite because fortnite is more accessible because its free Once bluehole realizes it doesnt need to compete and just focuses on improving the game I think the game can and will become a staple But its up to them As it stands right now the game isnt broken like everyone says I get good framerate and servers arnt as bad as people will have you believe At its current price i still believe its worth the buy,positive
Great game But they ban many people with no reason the hackers living free but the innocent player got ban,negative
This game just makes me sadI want to like it and keep it around as a rival for fortnite but it is just not up to par with it The hit reg is terrible and the damage of the guns just doesn t cut it when I am trying to play a semi realistic game When someone takes a double barrel to the face and you watch the blood come out and they still push you and kill you in four hits it is just disheartening and hard to keep playing this game with such bad gun damage,negative
I like this game i lust love Battle royal,positive
Bug bug bug bug bug bug bug bug wait cheat bug bug bug ,negative
Game is good but the developer practices are unexcusable,negative
This was a pretty promising and great game when it was in Early Access but it s just gone downhill since then Longstanding bugs are still present and hackers are still a major problem I won t make excuses for this game anymore Avoid it,negative
Runs poorly even with a gtx 1080,negative
So basically people pay 30  for this game In every other game every single bug gets fixed in 2 3 days But not in this game People pay for your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game and you are NOT fixing any of its crashes bugs and server lags The game sometimes doesnt load sometimes it crashes and developers are doing somethingnt to change it Guys dont buy it until it gets fixed,negative
I honestly don t see the hype in it The controls suck you can t see for the life of you and lord knows if you even try to be realistically tactical you ll be surprised to know that tactics don t matter in this game as far as one player mode goes All it is is a survival hide from everybody shooter like Crapnight and Wasteoftime Royale and you ll probably spending more time trying to adjust your sensitivity options because they are absolute trash Wait for this game to go FREE on steam before paying 30 dollars for it It s not worth it if you plan on playing soloTeam play is team play Group up Pray to god you win Its nothing new Its not innovativeI tried 5 hrs of play time Trying to be sneaky tactical and aware of my surroundings Hard to play a game that has very dire consequences if you a first time playerAlready submitted a refund and have uninstalled Nice try though  and that s without sarcasm,negative
Good game but HOWEVER  though it is still a early access game there are many issues with the game that just makes it difficult intricate and frustrating to enjoy  Some of these issues are included  Connection Issues Textures not loading properly fps drops and more These are all the worst issues I ve experienced with the game for now I will take a break from it and come back later to see if these issues are fixed or improved The past couple of days of playing this game has been awful sometime making me want punch through my computer screen,positive
can t play with my friends my friends are online and some of them even in game but it always tell me that they are offline and i can t even climb over a simple fence which is not that high i have to sprint first and then jumb its annoying,negative

Amazing Game with a huge potential Fun every time,positive
Game is broken not worth spending the money on at least for now It s almost like they re too blinded by all the money they earned through the game that they don t care to fix the issues  Or I m not sure just a new members experience Tried the game 10 times got to play half properly once Was fun though but the dozens of issues I faced are just nerve wracking,negative
Everything is fine and fixed but the servers are mostly busy so good internet is required,positive
One of the best games I played until noweven when it s still in beta Can t wait until it is officially released  Keep up the good work guys well done,positive
Awsome,positive

Really fun game with friends and alone but needs more optimization and bug fixes,positive
Yes it s an unfinished early access game but for the amount of money this game has made it should be infinitely better than it is I regret the money and time I ve put into this game,negative
Playerunknown s Battlegrounds  PUBG is a great concept game  Mixing survivalscavanging with team elimination combat makes for excellent gameplay  There are still bugs in the early release which causes lag and glitches in the early match  When you start with 99 players what do you expect   Even being outnumbered and sometimes losing quickly I keep coming back for more,positive
I was always a fan of console gaming until I decided to buy this game a fair distance off launch This game has changed the way I game I pre ordered WW2 on PC initially bought Destiny 2 on PC and a few other different game im looking into buying once they release This is huge for someone who has never really played PC other then occasional WoW from time to timeI strongly recommend this game to anyone with a decent computer I had to upgrade a fair bit in order to play on high  ultra settings but I didn t spend a whole lotThere are a few points that I must point out 1 When a team member dies in squads or duo it places a large white skull on their body making it impossible to see anyone beyond or looting that said body2 FPS drops quite a bit in many matches this isnt a huge thing but it does get annoying when in the middle of a gun fight and your guy decides to spike all over and place3 First person mode is extremely fun and enjoyable if you can get over the fact you feel like you 4 foot tall All the door handles and windows are eye level and after playing a few matches I begin to get a headacheThere are a few other points but at this time I feel those are my top 3 they are very small points and they dont effect my review of this game For being early access I would buy this game before the full game releases and the price doubles,positive
no,negative
EDIT  for all the people complaining about lag or bugs I play on an Alienware R4 and can play on ultra with no lag aside from a handful of moments that don t last long i have ran into a couple bugs like doors every 20 games or so but nothing that has hindered my game play or been anything more than giving me a little chuckle or minor annoyance for a few seconds and its rare So these people must be on very low end computers or exaggerating because they have a problem with the devs or something other than the game itselfAwesome game I definitely recommend it I usually only play MMORPG s I just came from console playing ESO to PC and I got PUBG and now its all I play I m not used to shooters but this is a whole new type of game being the battle royal style and with the realistic gun mechanics and physics it makes this way better than any shooter i have played in the past its enough to keep you interested and wanting to improve also there are different ways you can play depending on your stylemood,positive

This game is aidsIm decent at this game Got lots of kills and a few wins under my belt But this game is so boring sometimes It is legit running simulator sitting in a build simulator proning in grass during top 10 simulatorr etc Every game is the exact same thing Either you drop somewhere populated kill some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and die or drop somewhere unpopulated and have the most boring 30 minutes of your life You can just feel your fingers hurting from holding w and shift for a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing whole half hour Until you finally with no skills or kills reach top 10 Prone in the grass and die to some guy with level 3 everything and a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing silenced AWM Overall its pretty aids XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD,negative
this game is like batman LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed your mom and had a baby but then it just got all deformed and only eats macaroni and wont stfu when your play csgo    1010 great game for fetuses,positive
The idea behind the game is great and quite fun But in its current state the game is plagued by massive issues with lags disconnecting ui problems netcode issues balance problems hacker and griefer problems and so many more In its current state most people are going to be disappointed with what the game has to deliver When theyve ironed out the biggest issues i will recommend this game but for now i just cant recommend it,negative

Very addictive game to play its super easy to stay up all night with the  one more game  lie we all tell ourselves I ve personally had very few issues with cheating but I mostly play FPP so that could be why Once the early game lag the annoying frame drops from time to time and the  admittedly quite funny bugs that are in this game eventually get fixed it ll be great For now its decent,positive

This game has been a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE how since launch the release date pushed further and further back monthly updates turned into  whenever we feel like it  the games not even out yet already there are paid cosmetic items some akin to CS GO knife skins  My favorite controversy yet is when the devolpers caved for the Twitch streamers who complain about  stream sniping  and got players banned through mass reporting,negative

TBH IDK what the deal is with the FRing Streamers but I haven t experienced it so why would I give it a bad review if it doesn t personally affect me and I like the game  It s very dumb for these people to be giving this great game a negative review Maybe if you have a legitamate argument on why you don t enjoy the game with that as a reason then sure by all means But if you are here just to join the bandwagon then thats kind of dumb I have only seen TWO stories of people getting banned from this Me and my 2 other friends that play this have not gotten banned at allAnyways here are some pros and cons and my explanation on why I personally enjoy this gamePros Good with friends good alone Matchmaking doesn t give you empty squads but I have had instances were everyone left the squad pre gameIn game voice is flawless no need to add randos on steamThe loot is abundant however its possible to get nothing but a pistol for the rest of the game unfortunatelyCars frequently spawn but only on the outer edges of the map Anywhere else won t usually give you oneIf you only like first person then great The game has you covered just queue for FPP modesVery easy to figure out what to do and how to play I knew what to do by my second match Watch gameplays they help  although I didn t personally watch anyCons Honestly there is some lag between you and server which is bad because everyone sends signals to the server and you recieve them back its not p2p so you could unload into someone then they 2 shot you 1 second later and they are fine and you are deadYou can easily run yourself over make sure the vehicle is completely stationary before attempting to exitSomehow somewhere there are people dropping to the same location and are getting there first I don t understand I have looked at strategies all over the internet and still people will land before youHonestly to me the pros outway the cons The games matchmaking is shockingly fast as the game surpassed Dota 2 and CS GO in all time player peaks breaking several records its not surprising The last 2 things I want to say is to make sure you look up strats and buy the game now its not on sale and it WILL NOT BE TRUST ME ON THIS It won the summer sale without going on sale So yeah if I were them I wouldn t put it on sale either,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  loot system you only find LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in shotguns and its allway LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sunny and wenn its raining or fogy then you alway get killed by the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing zone or bugs                                            But its a great game i would recomend it,positive
I very much regret having to discourage getting this game   it s extremely fun and very rewarding to kill someone in  However it has SEVERE lag issues sometimes to the point that it feels like the servers are either more braindead than a Trump supporter or actively plotting to kill me  Recently the lag got so bad that I was forced to leave a game because it forced me to drive my UAZ into a river while outside the playzone  I VERY much wish I could recommend this game but the literal game breaking lag means that I cannot in my right mind put anybody else through that  If the developers fix this issue I will happily update this review to more accurately reflect my feelings about the gameplay model of PUBG,negative

Great concept it would great if I could play it  I have a top of the line PC w 1080ti 32GB 3200Mhz DDR4 Ryzen 1800X and I have the following issues  Half the time I can t interact with the UI on the main page If I try and do group play I get stuck at the loading screen  Friends report my player just gets booted out of the plane at the end and float the ground and stands there Most of the time I can t click the  Play  button if I m in a group Controls feel unpolished inventory and item interaction is unintuitive Devs are a bunch of cry babies about Epic Games making a Battle Royal system like PUBG has the sole rights to it  Ark SotF H1Z1 You shouldn t charge for a game with this many issues it s not even a polished turd   just a stinky slushy plop,negative

There isn t much to say about this game other then the fact that it is full of hackers A simple youtube search on Pubg hacking will show you how bad it is Save yourself the money and move on Until they fix this problem this game is just a waist of time I m LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because I can t return it as it takes more then 2 hours to get the feel of it and by the time you figure out how the game works and notice how many hackers there are its to late to return it,negative
I do not recommend buying this game while its still in early access  The game has not been optimized yet and still has many glitches Wait for it to be fully released  This game isn t ready for prime time yet,negative

I have a love hate relationship with this gameUsed to love it until I managed to place 2nd multiple times only to be killed by a barrage of frag grenades Like literally On a flat endgame zone the one with most frags winsGuys nobody uses stuns or smoke nades because they re pretty much useless compared to frags Maybe balance that out a little bit  Like making stuns flashbangs that actually blind or at least really incapacitate the target  And maybe nerf frags a bit so they don t do lethal damage from 15m away when you re flat on the ground with your feet to the explosion  Yeah I know that s what frags are for but this is a gameSure I could spend the game stocking up on frags and spam them around at the end of the game but that s not the point of this game I don t want to be throwing away three quarters of my ammo just so I can cram another five frags into my t1 backpackMaybe treat frags like ammo so it takes longer to grab one from the backpack after you threw the two three on your belt I m sure you can come up with a good way to give frag stockers diminishing returnsI m sick of it,positive
Nearly every game there is a hacker either bluehole fixes the anti cheat and starts vac ban and ip banning cheaters or this game will die Like 50  of the hackers are people with chinese names so people are using chinese names or it s just chinese people hacking They shouldn t region lock the chinese they should make it if you have a ping higher than 250 ms then you re then moved to a server that works better This game is dying and we need the hackers gone,negative

Don t waste your money the game devs only care about it and their s and the game image They re not even putting time into fixing the game the amount of bugs I find in a single game is unreal And don t get me started on the community cancerous streamers the shear amount of hackers and that doesn t even cover the the things I hear in the pregame lobby voice chat That doesn t even mention the the fact the whole game feels unbalenced Trust me and buy a different game you ll be glad you did I sure wish I did But I won t see a cent back because I can t get a refund,negative
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE especially if your on SEA area buildings render 1 2 mins game not optimized,negative
lags awful on my pc,negative
The game has a fair bit of work to go as in for some major bugs and a few things to work around Although for an early access game definitely worth the money would recommend to anyone interested in the genre that this game offers,positive
The game is amazing Stuning vissuals great gameplay and a lot of players,positive
I really liked the game but optimization for sucking machines would be appreciated ,positive
This is the game for real thing of some places,positive
I played this game and after a while I relized it was just like minecraft hunger games just with a plane at the begging this game is filled with glitches bugs campers and crappy people just like minecraft hunger games They are exactly the same and I can t belive they are charging 2999 when you can get minecraft for 25 and have the EXACT same experiance I prefer minecraft hunger games over this game as its cheaper and less boring but it can be extremely annoying to play this game so I rate it a 911  ,negative

I love this game so muchBut the devs should make it so that when u r in a party it displays a different colour than offline and online,positive
Get banned if a streamer cries that you were watching them even if you pay more attention to the game than them I never even take my eyes off the screen and my buddy was banned for me killing a streamer,negative
With multimedia bringing the masses to this game it is very hard to know who is foe and streamers Population control due to streamers feeling offended about their losses and wrongfully reporting innocent people for Stream snipping Honest and sadly the resolution to this situation is to put a delay for those who are streaming this game to not be  stream snipped  This is going to be an on going situation before they start crowd controlling people Dont let this game become political because of easy an easy fix like a 5 minute delay on stream,negative
At this phase the game has loads of bugs and you can have a trash experience It s fun with friends to have a laugh if you can run it of course because the optimization is garbage Even me having a 2016 pc i only run in 40 fps with huge drops on ultra in 1080p Edit  After the 10 release the improvement is visibile and the game seems to be on a good path rn sure yesterday i just got killed from 500 m by a dude that was bursting his m16a4 with a red dot that headshoted me nevertheless that does not happen that often so it s ok i guess as long as he got banned Update got me better graphic settings better framerate  about 20 30 frames on average less lag and better experience overall,positive
It s ok,positive
It is a good game Very nice  I am a girl I am from london  Play game with me friends,positive

Don t buy in early access the game uses a hidden elo system for the matches while the game is still brokenLatency bad servers hit registration lag no region lock  so ppl from NA can play EU servers with 150 ping and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you over by killing you before you can see them peek loot is more rng because they have put in so many useless guns  bullet drops after 10m There are too many issues with the game that makes me not recommend it,negative
game crashed when geting into match stuck at loading screen devs lied about microtransations,negative
I like my chicken deep fried,positive
Short version   The game is fun however you will run into all sorts of problems all the time Wait for updatesThe game is plagued by issues that are not being addressed Instead of fixing these things we get some unnecessary things like microtransactions for lootboxes  forcing post processing and shadows for all players even though it ruins the fps even more  and making it near impossible to crouch jump Early game desync Combat looting and even doing any other action   like opening doors   right at the start of the game feels unresponsive In this period it s very common to miss on loot  die behind a cover to a guy and even having to open the door twice or morePerformance Desync is not the only issue in the early game If you don t have very powerful computer prepare that your textures might take a while to load I am talking around 2 minutes maybe even more In this time you can fall through textures  be stuck in textures  can ride a vehicle through houses Even stronger computers might not get 60fps all the time And after last few updates it gets even worse Forced post processing forced shadows pushing the fps even lowerMelee combat in this game is embarassing I don t understand how it can be in the game considering how broken it is You can stay next to a person attack them with a melee weapon without landing a hit on them It gets even worse when they are downed And it doesn t help that you need to hit a person few times with a melee weaponRNG deciding way too many things It s fine to decide what loot spawns where or where the zones are even though sometimes you get magically screwed by the zone being on the other part of the map and you spend majority of the game on the run What is not acceptable is having the RNG decide map for you I don t want special weather map   I prefer the default one Getting into a lobby 4 times only to find the game will have special weather is annoying Another thing is red zones that you can sometimes run through other times the first two shells fall right at youMany other smaller issues The game doesn t save your queue options if you are playing solo Queueing first person on EU server  After the game it will be defaulted to third person on Asian servers  Some things are very loud You better mute the in game sound when in a plane  buggy because otherwise you won t hear your teammates Rain is also quite loud but you can t do anything about that  Crouch jump   a mechanic that makes the movement a lot more fluid   is near impossible to do consistently Even the best players in the game aren t able to do it and developers decided rather than making it easy for everyone it should be very hard  mechanical  skill,negative
Amazing game Especially for only 30,positive
Frustrating Can  you please make at least some routes to get onto the mainland if your comming by boat you have to travel half the map to find a place to get up  not to mention the high graphic requirements along with emense lag  would be fun if I could see who killed me or from where,negative

Asset flipping battle royal game It has some elements to it but feels sluggish and slow It is also extremely repetitive and quickly fadesI think Epics Fortnite is a better alternative Also they ban people for killing streamers who basicallty advertise the game for free Way to go you greedy cucks,negative
do not play if bad compter,negative
16hours into that game and already like it Playing this game with friends definitly is a good choice if you come from CS GO Not sure if this game will ever be ready for competetive gaming   since to many random parameters   but still   a game worth playing,positive
I hate that i need to wait for buildings 2 load And me going around with 40 60 fps lol But it s my pc not the game The game is so fun to play Especially with friends i recommend playing with friends  ,positive
Overall a good game however it took some time to understand it and really get some fun from it  ,positive
Recommend Only If You re Okay With Dying A Lot Most of the time due to forces outside your control Regardless of what anyone says this game is heavily based on luck Don t expect to be getting your chicken dinners so easily if ever I love this game but god damn is it frustratingThis game is NOT for everyone You have to be sure this is the kind of torture you enjoyMixed feelings but slightly mostly positive,positive
It s like Fortnite but without the base building,positive

I do enjoy this game alot and thought it was run by really good people But the owner playerunkown himself is saying he will take legal action against people who make games around this type of gamemode like he owns the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing idea The original idea from battle royale came from a old movie made in japan Unbeilavable that he is that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing money hungry to try to take credit for an idea that isnt even his in the first place,negative

Good GameCan be a buggy at times but you can expect that from a early access game also really easy to get going in my second game i was already getting kills,positive

its garbage,negative
Firstly I want to say how good the game could be but unfortunately its full of issues I uninstalled the game once a few months back but my friend wanted to give it another go Ive really enjoyed the game initially but before long I found myself wanting to enjoy playing which quickly turned into forcing myself to like it And like before when I uninstalled it the game has got very boring and laborious My love for the game has turned into hate and I wont be installing it again Jokes on me though right  I paid for it after all Well I couldnt care less  thats how much Ive come to disliking the game PUBG must be careful as Fortnite  although thats not my cup of tea has kicked its a and soon there will be games very similar  and there are but with a polished finish and will have ironed out the problems which PUBG currently possess a lot of I could go through a list of problems I have encountered with PUBG but I simply cant be bothered to waste my time Ta Ta,negative
I play different games depending on my mood ect Player Unknown s Battlegrounds is what it is I don t play it every day But when I do I enjoy it So here s the thing  At first I was figuring things out and dying quite a bit without ever even getting a shot off But at one point I really just wanted a kill And when I got a good clean kill I was running on adrenaline for awhileI was pumped Those that have played know what I am talking about It s a good feeling Then later in my career I got the chicken dinner Another equally excellent moment As of writing this I am running about top 8  on the North American server which I feel pretty good about So this is not a brag fest I am truly kind of a casual Pubg player But I have a fairly consistant strategy that works for me There are better players than me for sure and I can deal with that But there are definitely people that use exploits that in a way you just have to accept I do not see obvious exploits that often though I ve only reported twice    I have a friend that comes over and we play tag team I play a round and then he plays a round ect It s really as fun watching as it is playing We even ventured into  one man wrecking crew  Which is where you run solo but most of the other players are on 4 man teams It s a game might as well give it a shot right    The bottom line is that this is a really good quality game and it s really fun and challenging If it hurts your ego too much to go through a difficult  as in you are going to die alot learning curve well this may not be for you But if you are a gamer this is a good game Con   microtransaction cratesbut no one is forced into paying for the keys I sure won t pay,positive

If your looking for a battle royale game i  would say this game is the bestAlso people say that there are a lot of Hackers in the game that used to be true but not anymore i play this game a lot and i havent seen 1 hacker for like 7 months now,positive
Extremely addictive Amazing game,positive
This game is defenetly on the top 10 games i have ever played alongside great games like battlefield 4 portal halflife 2 black ops 2 ori and the blind forest battlefield 2 Rainbow six siege hearthstone and dishonoredIf you dont have a medium to high end pc setup you should probably not pick it up though if you care about getting above 60 fps because its really demanding  I have heard that people with pc s that are not top of the line have alot more crashesWith that said if you are going to start playing this game i highly recomend playing the first few matches in solo games just to get an idea of how the game works before starting playing with your m8s Then when you are a little bit more familiar with the game mechanichs and starts to comunicating and working out strategies with friends taking down enemy teams and getting your first wins thats where the game really shines in my opinion PS thank god for the mute feature  ctrlm when you are on the spawn island before the games starts,positive
been playing this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a while bit buggy but still playable and loads of fun i get it because this is an early acces game so i can t say that this game a failure because it s still in progress for perfection so im gonna give it a thumbs up and recommendation for this a hell out of fun so many things to discovers can t wait for desert map tho and FIX this buggy LOVE LOVE LOVE   great game THX,positive
If you have 2gb of ram dont play If you have 4gb of ram but a decent setup sure try ahead,positive
Great game Always action packed even when your lying down you need to be fully aware Love the game,positive

People who have bad internet have an advantage Instead of them rubberbanding they can shoot you whilst you ve been behind a tree for 5 seconds I can t tell you how many times I ve peeked someone then gone back behind cover only to be shot by the same person who can t possibly be able to seehit me Poor optimization is another big issue So many people have a texture bug that makes he game unplayable for the first minute or so of you being on the ground Instead of fixing that they devs decide it s a better idea to add more broken weapons and micro transactions These people clearly don t care about their game or fixing it It might be in early access but you d think that they would focus on making the game better and more optimized rather than adding things that make them more money With the texture glitch structures are not solid If you land at shelter and have this bug you can try to go in and it will put you under the map where you can easily win the game without any items It s like these devs have no idea what s going on inside their game They don t care anyway because they re getting paid,negative
rubbish,negative
Very fun and the RNG adds the ability to win or lose any game squads or duos are lots of fun however solo is fun as well If you have 30 I d grab it before it get released and becomes 40 60 Game is buggy and little laggy yes however if you can read it says EARLY ACCESS Most of these things will be fixed in due time,positive
Its fun for the first game or two but then all the fun just drops away It s only fun if you re playing with a squad and even then there are other squards much better than you and who have played the game for longer Dropping into a named zone is a deathwish and dropping in a rural are means you wont see anyone until top 30 and by then everyone else has the best gear and you only have what you scavanged Overall 810 game but replayability is 110 and in this game replayability is everything,negative
not my type of game,negative
Positive   The game is highly addictiveNegatives   It s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trash as far as playability goes Crashes constantly or has massive FPS issues no matter the type of PC you re running As far as lag goes it is very minimal in the servers but the crashing is unbareable most times and fact the game is so unstable would say to not buy it yetIt s worth far less than the 40 you pay for it and shouldn t be sold at that especially considering it is early alpha,negative
me want game but pc no gud enough plz give me money for new pc,positive
I downloaded this game to understand why people like this and because my friends have been playing a lot I refunded it after a hour and a half The game has serious performance issues even on ultra low quality on my 6GB GTX 1060 and AMD FX 8320  which are not the best components but they re nice and can run basically every other gameThe gameplay is unoriginal and uninspiring and you ll often find yourself spending an awful amount of time just running around out in the openThe graphics are old and outdated  and yet they are managed very badly by the game Overall I think the game is quite bad,negative
Wouldn t it be nice if OCE got some recognition and the devs gave us full FPP,positive
Highly recommend  Lot of people with 300 hrs of play time say it sucks  Games only been out for 6 months ppl playing it likes it s a second job who get their jimmies rustled by cosmetic microtransactions or some arbitrary banning  I mean is it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t yea kinda but it doesn t really affect me so far  The game is a different experience it s what H1Z1 should ve been,positive

I love the game but am sick of the crashing problems  Guys I don t want to turn off my overclock close my steam and Nvidia overlay reinstall C Ditributables etc etc    all in HOPES it will not crash at launch or on exiting to lobby  PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THIS A PRIORITY BEFORE CONCENTRATING ON NEW MAPS  I don t care if it takes a third party just let us run this game just like any other game  By freaking clicking on itOtherwise it s a fun game and runs well when it runs  Not everyone has these problems but I m a freaking tech guy who has went through every fix all the way down to delete games settings file and multiple reinstalls  to no surefire fix  You Devs do great work but it s all for nothing without the finesse of a good running engine,positive
The game is fun Until you get a match where you spend 10 20 minutes scrounging for a decent loadout only to be killed by someone who has an auto aim bot This would be ok if it only happened once in a while but it happenes almost every other gameI got to the final 2 in one match  for example had a great loadout and a decent position only to be headshot No big deal until i check the deathcam and see the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  s aim auto snapped to my headDon t recommend you buy this game until they figure out a better way to prevent cheaters Right now there s only a report system which doesn t give you your match back,negative

Oh Boy PUBG  Where to start 100 People  Last one standing wins  I just cover aspects of the game as any outside drama can be researched elsewherePros  Decent weapon variation Fun Co OP play  Duos or squad super fun Different play styles can work here so it s open to be played however you d like Large Map Ton of variations for the weapons also adjusting to the play styleCons   Buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   One map so far  Cosmetics being sold before the game is completed  Buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Honestly for how buggy this game is I love it to death  It s the closest thing I ve gotten to Mod DayZ  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  current DayZ BTW   This game is thrilling and every game feels fresh to me  The bugs are plenty  Stuff not spawning until after you land  Cars flipping left and right  Ghost sounds of actions that never happened  Landing with your parachute leading to like a 15  health loss  Cosmetics clipping through scopes making visibility impossible  A TON of bugs  But I enjoy this all the sameBe cautious  If you re like me and needed to feel the thrill of playing DayZ Mod again this game is for you  If you can look past the bugs and inconsistancy of parts of the game its truly some of the msot fun I ve had in a very long time  If you want a polished game this is not itI recommend this game purely on the basis of how much fun I have not whether or not Bluehole deserves your money  I spent 30 dollars and have gotten 164 hours of time at the time of posting this I m sure to spend more  I ve made worse purchases,positive
Let me tell you this PUBG is fantastic in every single aspect right now H1Z1 is literally the game to play if you where looking for a  king of the hill  type of game   H1Z1 was the game And PUBG is now the game to playBut even so to me it s still way ahead actually light years ahead of H1Z1With marvelous updates PUBG delivers a fully blown action packed survival experienceFor 2999 It s a strategy game A perfect blend with Action Strategy and  know how Most people probably think that you ll be able to join a server get some loot and run around killing people   And that s true to some extent   But these people usually ends up dead in 15 minutes or soThis game is not about how many kills you get This game is all about surviving until the end   You could obviously go  Rambo  on your enemies and blast their guts out of their bodies But even Rambo will have a hard time doing that As it s 100 people in totalcircle and fight until only 1 survivehttps steemitcomletsplayhitmeasapgame review player unknown s battlegrounds pubg review by evildolltvHow To Make PUBG 1 Unknown Player1 Already Good H1Z11 Ability to Make H1Z1 BetterSome extremely good gunplayCouple   2   3  Toxic Players who ridiculously over react even when they die the right waySkins Cash Cow   And WOW you got a steam 1 game  Nice that was TOTALLY unaticipatedNo but seriously I plan on having an obsurd amount of time on this game so uh future me go outside,positive

 So to counterattack disproportionate bursts of negative reviews Valve have added unusual activity warnings to Steam store pages with histograms tracking reviews over time Congratulations Devs and steam instead of bringing a good product on the market to earn your money you try to discredit the critics being made by customers of this product Me the customer  i can speak only for myself am not a cow you can milk I am a real person and pay with real money that i earn with real work So to say its not EA money it is real money therefore i expect real quality Can you provide this  And no i dont care about your development problems or plans or whatever because you dont care about my problems and plans to earn my money you expect me to pay with real money so i expect from you a real product and not to try to discredit the critic as  oh noes critic negative bomb how unfair Thanks for your time,negative

Bought it played a few games decided it wasn t for me  at least not right now got a refund It s not a bad game it s just not for everyone There s no denying it s incredible popularity and I d definitely recommend giving it a go to find out if you like it  it might change your life However don t be afraid to click on the refund button if it turns out that it s likely to stay in your Steam library and not be played The difficulty curve is steep Not ridiculously so but certainly on a par with something like Dark Souls the main difference being that you ll be put into games with people who like you are just starting but there will also be experts and pro standard players If this is something you like to experience and you re eager to try a battle royale game definitely give this a try,positive
I got scared when i saw this game came out on steam and  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing  cheaters of course  i have realised by the time i was playing that this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but catchy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I dont want to hate on this game but i can say many things about  it that you might find funny actuallySo lets begin with all this stolen models from unreal engine market and other sites You will say that they made this models but this isn t true at allhttps wwwredditcomrPUBATTLEGROUNDScomments6sa2t1bluehole_buys_assets_for_pubgOk you saw that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Of course you saw itAnd there are many other models stolenBugs like flying with motorcycles and not well done textureingUpdate  After many updates and releases this game is not in touch with 2018 i thought maybe they would work on this game and repair its bugsglitchs but they didntI have seen no improvement after all this timeDont buy itI don t recommend it to any of you,negative
Cooking a grenade pre patch  well hold in fire button as would make sense release when well doneCooking after patch  Hold grenade now press  R  to remove pin then wait and press fire at some point Perfect functionality already why would you want to LOVE LOVE LOVE  that up this badly Also you plan to implement vaulting yet resourceful players found a way to keybind around it making it possible to scale the places you should already be able toYour solution then is to remove that possibility BEFORE you even implement a vault option yourself  Why not just let it be possible untill you have time to fix it yourself And don t get bossed around by streamers they can put up delays or cover maps or whatever on their part it should be impossible to get banned for shooting streamers because they themselves can t manage their own streamYou still get a thumbs up because so far it s a nice game and i really enjoy playing it but some recent decisions like above mentioned better not make the first steps to a steady decline in reasonable developer decisions,positive

Right so here we goPUBG Is a great game with many of the current popular game element like the surival and apocalyptic aspects and gave it a very unique twist which is highly addicting  I ve played DayZ but that was just a little bit too slow paced for my liking I didn t really feel a sence of purpose or direction of what to do there and could literally be walking for 8 hours and find a rotten apple and a shirtPUBG Is fast paced and action packed with the red zone and the permitted fighting zone continuously getting smaller definately gives you a thrill and rush of adrenalineHOWEVER Performance and Stability wise there needs be a LOT of improvement And I m getting the impression the DEVS have put their priorities in all the wrong directions There are simple performance and coding issues which should be resolveable with a patch in a day Which now many of us players are having to arrange   fixes   for certain bugs issues ourselvesI know this is early access alpha whatever But there are TONS of minor issues MORE important then streamers live streaming ETC Try and fix these first before you start losing trust of your players and then move on to getting publicity etc Nobody has ever becomes successfull promoting a broken buggy gameI mean is there still a   DEVELOPMENT   TEAM  or just a Marketing and Finance department Anyway That will be all for now I m still enjoying the game and I will keep playing as of yet Just hope these issues don t persist too long and cause me and possibly many others to lose faithKindest regardsSvenarchy,positive
My game used to run flawlessly Their September update however absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed my game in some way and I m not sure how to fix it Upon landing every building is a messy blob of textures that I can t enter it just forces me out Along with unloaded textures I receive a staggering amount of stutters and overall poor FPSI used to play this game for hours and hours but seeing that I am at a severe disadvantage at the start of every game I can t possibly give it a positive review I hope this is fixed soon so I can change downvote into an upvoteEdit  They seemed to have fixed my issue with the 10 release My game runs 10 times faster and its as smooth as ever Fantastic jobDouble edit  Cheaters and hackers everywhere Played six solo games and got killed by a cheater in every single one,negative
While some aspects of this game are undeniably fun  parachuting in pimping out guns flipping motorcycles off of hills the game is horrendously inconsistent  The  protective gear  sometimes will stop a grenade and other times will do nothing vs a single pistol shot instantly dropping you to the ground  With no direct way to see which weapons actually are supposed to do more  damage  it seems the game designers just threw random numbers together and sometimes you get a shotgun that can shoot someone from the top of a building down the street of the next city over And then that same shotgun will lose a close range fight with a frying pan  Do not recommend this game to anyone who wants consistency in their gameplay seems like exceptionally lazy design,negative

So after all the early access rubbish now it s full release Is it worth it NoSimply no This is supposed to have working gamepad support  it s uselessIt s an 18 game    sadly it is still full of 12yr olds and they refuse to do anything about itThe joke that this game is console ready yet lacks the fundamental gamepad cotrolls for menusnavigation and gameplay are beyond uselessTo be fair this game is only a mod on something else and these people are making money off that by doing little to nothing I doub t I would reccomend the game to anyone even if it was only 5 because there has been little to no effort put in by the developers from the very start of early access,negative

Great game for an early acces title Developers of PUBG have done great job in achieving the ideal battle royale type of hectic chaos and in the same time well balanced great to play in enviroment Also the developers are extremely active on social medias continuesly relelasing new update info and keeping up with the communitys demands and the monthy updatesPros of this game  Monthy updates responsive developers Beatiful game designs and cool unique enviroment The competiveness Ability to play in duos or squads with friends The priceSome cons  You need a pretty sick machine to run this over 60 fps at all times Parts of the community that are intentionally looking to make playing the game normally harder teamkillers and trolls etc The developers worshipping of streamersMy overall opinion of the game is that its a great game that i don t regret even a bit about buying there are some problems to be solved but you have to keep in mind that it is indeed a early acces title and nothing can be perfectoverall rating would have to be 810,positive

Runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Plagued with bugs but atleast they have the micro transactions in  _ After over 150 hours the optimisation has improved a bit It s still not great and not even close to being able to be called  released  but it s managable nowThe combat is still pretty damn clunky and at times you feel like instead of running about you are controlling a ship on the high seas The biggest problem by far however is the hacking It s insane At least 1 in 5 games will have you being killed by some little 12 YO who sucks and has to buy unfair LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t It is a real shame because the idea is great but the execution and polish are far from being ready to be called a  finished  game Combined with the fact that the anti cheat is beyond useless and you have a 20  thrilling brilliant gem and an 80  clunky laggy buggy hacker ridden turd,negative

Not recommended The game is FULL of rough patches the shooting feels off most of the time the ping differences decide a lot of the firefights there are several servers in each region so your ping will fluctuate and the developers are iether ignoring or are incapable of making player requested changes Put your wallet down and go watch it on Youtube until something better than this comes along,negative

I would not recommend this game before the area in china is locked by bluehole or anyone regionlockchina as 99  news spreads cheaters come from china and i have lots of recording evidence when i am killed in strange way by someone who has a nickname that kind of person china and 70  when I play random on any server I always get china unlike other games like csgo or others we will get experience with all players in the world and pubg like i m living in china now and that s why I always get china but the fact is I do not live in china this sucks my game is not bad i managed to win in solo and squad  6x win but the game will end when you meet china,negative
One of my most played games and it s still in early acess The concept is simple you jump out of a plane and chose which area of the map you want to parachute to Once you hit the ground it s everyman and his dog for themselves The aim is to survive as long as possible and become the last to survive or become the last team to survive As the game progresses the map will spawn kill zones aka the blue zone being outside these zones will damage you So make sure you run like Usain bolt or atleast run like Mo Farah as you try and run and gun your way through this game,positive
I bought this game today 3 hours of trying to get it to load and the welcome menu wont even load  Dual 780Ti on a Corei7 running windows 10 with 32GB of ramI spent 3 hours installing windows updates updating video card drivers and attempting every fix i could find online  No change but i did find hundreds of posts online from people with the same problem  I m told the game is great but seems compatibility with common hardware is non existent not sure how to return software to steam but I guess i will have to figure that out at this time I wouldnt recommend anyone buys this game,negative

I don t log a lot of time in games like this but hey It s sooooo much fun I guess its Optimal for me ok badPuns aside the key word of the day for Bluehole is Optimum or actually what they should be doing Optimizing Yeah this is really my only problem so far I have a i7 6770K edition running a GTX 960 w 4 GB Vram and 32 RAMM built into the base machine I should not have what i ll call  hiccups  in framerate My other quams can wait till you fix the blaringly obvious issue in front of you But ill list them to be safe Stream sniping is cheating   Lets face it No one likes being had especially someone getting tips for playing an online game w public players But I hardly ever get put in a squad where i can look at names and go  Oh my gosh a streamer Let me look at his stream and kill his B       right now  See where this is going  How in a million years do you think it probable when your matchups are random  I m not saying its Impossible just highly Improbable It s also the risk THEY are in for cause they put it out there You can t say their cheating if the streamer makes it all too easy to find themselves and doesn t think far enough ahead to avoid these problemsControls  I ll admit i ve adjusted slightly My aim is not the best but its better than before My problem is that I feel like the controls are fighting me while im focused on everything else The recoil I don t mind but when I miss two of three shots and get a headshot on accident just WTF  I mean it all goes back to OPTIMIZE It s part of the process and you shouldn t put it off much longer A game of PUBG s standing needs polish to better the experienceMaps  or the lack thereof  I think its on everyones mind right now Where is the map variety  Why cant I battle it out in snow  For a gamemode like battle Royale layout is key to victory and I think a roster of landscapes will spice up the game as well as throw some veterans for a massive loop in gameIn all respect I love the game as is But going forward there needs to be more OPTIMIZING for thecurrent mechanics and graphics so that users aren t Bogged down by background processes as well as more content that will be playable,negative

Months after  release  and it still feels like an early access gamePROS  The battle royal concept is fun The gunplay is better than other battle royal games  maybe the best for nowCONS  Kicks you out of the games at times You lose control over the character at times when you alt tab Can t connect to servers frequently cause  it s too busy  Sounds are a little off so you don t know what direction you re getting shot from Bugs Like exploding vibrating cars when its beside a rock the wrong way  Character movement feels like you re treading on water all the time Maps are too big You spend a lot of the time walking across empty fields with the auto run  if you can t find a car Laggy Very very laggyAfter all this time the game still feels like a half baked attempt at BRDon t buy this unless  You have the patience of a buddhist monk You REALLY like the battle royal games You have a decent PC,negative

Fun but performancehungry and full of little annoying faultsGranted it is early access so the performance might advance The biggest fault in my opinion is the input delay that some players including me experience We are talking about 01 secons This is combined with a laggy image in combat situations I am willing to forgive the little faults of this game but this one makes it almost unplayableThis might develop into a good game but I haven t had a whole lot of good experience with EA games that were full of potential I am looking at you ARKEDIT  The Servers are crap right now The development is only advancing for the cashgrab called  console release  We don t get Performance Optimization we don t get Servers we don t get good loot allocation either you find no Scope or 3 8x in one group of houses They are working on Vaulting before the game is otherwise frustration free There are so many bugs The priorities are on profit and fame only 350000 Invitational for a Game that was and IS far from finished This will be a Release like ARK An unfinished Game that will never be what it could have been But the  are already made SadHackers like crazyI doubt that this game will be recommendable ever I am waiting for a good Battle Royale then I can leave this forever potentially good BR hype,negative

This game has it s issues like every other game out there However with all the controversy surrounding this title I can still reccomend it The core gameplay is simply just good Even if there are networking issues occasionally which Bluehole is actively working on fixing and some other red flags like the loot boxes but everything that worries people is a minimal factor at best to your actual enjoyment of what matters  the gameplaySo What makes the core gameplay so good that even despite the red flags that popular media loves to point out worthy to suggest this title Simply put there s nothing out there in the battle royale genre that is refined to this extent and is being purpose made to be the best experience in the genre And I believe this game is well on it s way to being the best royale experience from my hours of play and watching the media criticize and patronize it I whole heartedly believe that this game will stand the test of time and go down in gaming history as the first indie early access title to attain the type of success it has with extremely memorable gameplay and fitting visuals to bootThe game is not without it s issues despite it s phenomonal gameplay The hacker issue so many people love to point out is evident in any major multiplayer title The networking issues seem to come down to hard coded network code that Bluehole is essentially waiting on Epic to issue a fix in the current Unreal Engine 4 so people trying to go for their pitch forks and blame Bluehole for them dying to poor hit registry well it simply isn t entirely their fault and they are at the whims of Epic Games to fix some core network code It s a very matter of fact state of things for this game I tend to notice I for one will continue enjoying my chicken dinners up until no one is populating the servers anymore thanks for reading and I hope this gave you a little more insight to PLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS,positive
This is my  biased mostly positive view of the game so farNow there is a lot of hate and alot of love for this game so it s somewhat hard to come to a decision wheter or not you should buy this game The main talking points so far seem to be performance cheating game crashes and more recently the whole stream sniping fiascoNow this game is in early acces and has been in development slighlty under two years For that type of time frame I d say we have been given a fairly well functioning despite not being fully optimiced game with tons of replayability Lower end PCs tend to have recurring problams like textures not loading stutterning and fps drops but personally if your rig is similar to my own those type of issues should crop up rarely  If they do the issue is more likely to be at your end than the games I have spent time playing with a ton of people with different rigs and for the majority of them even on low end PCs the experience has been enjoyable Sure there are times when you get frustrated because you dropped frames or the server lagged and end up dying but hey it happens The experience I ve gotten so far is still a ton more enjoyable than any other battle royale game out there And guys give the devs a few breaks will ya you can tell just by seeing they re interviews that they have a whole lot of love for this game and they re doing theyr best Sure thy ve made boatloads of money so far but that dosen t mean that they can just throw it the at servers and expect them to run faster or better Besides they are entitled as creatores to slow down a bit and take a few breaks here and there As long as the passion is there you know they will be working on the game to make it a greater playing experience for all of us sure there will be stuff we don t like but that s what early access is for  to test stuff see what works and what dosen t at the end of the day though you can t appease everyone Have a little patience As for the cheaters look we re on PC and with 10 million copies sold there are bound to be people who just can t get by without cheats But in the 450 or so hours I ve put into this game I ve had perhaps 4 or so instances where i thought something was fishy Rest of the time I ts just been my own stupidity and lack of aim that has gotten me killed Now the whole stream sniping thing has been thrown way out of proportion by rumors and here say Ending up in the same lobby as a streamer is highly unlikely not to mention killing them Some of the people that have been banned so far is because they choose to doLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE like this https clipstwitchtvInquisitiveCorrectManateeKappaPride instead of just playing the game normally Granted they paid 30 bucks for it so they are entitled do play the game how they want aslong as they don t cheat or use gamebreaking exploits  wich are the devs fault But queing up to same the game as the streamer round after round to follow them around is a bit idiotic Granted there are steps on the streamers side to avoid this like hiding the server ip and putting on a stream delay but looking at it from their perspective they re just normal people who want to play the game and entertain us In my personal opinion these bans should be made weekly or monthly instead of them being permanent as they seem to be so far However I don t think it s unfair for streamers do have the opportunity provided that they have enough VIDEO evidence and have the devs look at the player logs to get these people banned  They don t have the power to just call up the devs and say   Hay I don t like that this guy killed me ban him   Streamers have done alot to get this game where it is and I m glad for it I absolutely love itIn the thousands of hours that my group of friends has put into this game on verious servers we have yet to run into a streamer that one us watches nor has anyone of the hundreds of people related to our group been banned The people that kick up all this dust are the ones that want to follow streamers around and act like small children A normal player like you and me has nothing to worry aboutWith over 400 hours played some good some not so good I got to say this game has earned the money I ve paid for itOh and people whining about the whole crate and loot system   market   who the f cares It s cosmetic prob took a minimal time of coding If a guy or gal wants to pay a hundred bucks for a skirt let em,positive
Please fix PUBG The game is way too buggy and the servers are way too laggy and rubberband a lot It s a great game but I wish that they would pay attention to fixing these issues rather than adding more skins or events and focus on making the game  Esports ready ,positive

Very good games,positive
Used to enjoy this but now NA servers are being taken over by huge amounts of high ping players that makes the game pretty much unplayable most of the time region lockping limit would fix this but doubt devs will do anything about it till the 10 has been released and will try again thenOtherwise the game is fun and addictive and even better with mates,negative
It s a buggy mess run by developers with little to no experience in making a proper game I had fun with it for a while when patches were somewhat frequent and the game was showing improvement but now that optimization has taken a back burner to microtransactions and the devs media whoring I doubt the game is going anywhere fastIf you have buddies to play with pick it up and enjoy it for a few weeks You will probably get your 30 worth But if you want an engaging competitive experience you will be sorely disappointed by horrible networking and hit registration rampant cheating and engine bugs that will never be fixed,negative

So after 26 hours I got my first chicken dinner which means I have nothing to prove myself in EA and I Can wait for full released game thus this review   I just hope I didnt kill any streamer Game is a battle royal genre which means you get dropped on an island people killing each other and try to be the last one survivor as playable arena gets smaller by the timeThis is not overall game review for everyonebut players who love stealth silent predator playstyle Game is most of the time the most played game on steam there are plenty of reviews you should have some rough info about this game already by this time1 My biggest problem in this game  render distance of grass  is terrible Every player who has at least 2x scope can see you across the map If you want to go across field forget about crawling your best bet is to just run zig zagging if someone is shooting at you and ghillie suit will not help you either If you want to cover yourself from unwanted attention of sniper your best bet is tree rock or a house not even bush will save you Render distance of grass is set aprox 100 m so you might be fine for closer distances but bevare of players using foliage setting on very low It is still kinda densebut only when you are very close Always keep your back against the solid object because no matter how hard you scout area in front of and behind you you are still very visible from distance My advice is move through areas with trees where they cast shadowsif you have not equipped bright colored clothes 2Clothes There are microtransactions in this game and those are clothes Some say its cosmetics and it doesnt matter But believe me it does You start with shinny clothes and people who unlocked nice dark camouflaged clothes  are in advantage right from the beginning You land after parachuting from plane and right from the beginning you shine around like snowman in desert Its good to go where no one does but loot might not be worthy and you never know who is around3Sound Almost everything makes sound You are not gonna tip top I tried that as I was hitting WASD gentlybut fast like woodpecker still making noise even turning around makes noise You better camo your footsteps with plane passing by Its different when its rainy Youre not gonna hear anyone outside running Silenced guns are good when shooting from large distances but loud close When you hear someone coming best thing to do is just freeze and wait for him getting better position or cover is bad idea because you immediately give away your position when you move 1 meter and there is no problem shooting through walls like they are not even there4 Framerates When you suddenly encouter player close to you you might get huge lag spikes which might get you killed because those miliseconds of reaction time matter a lot and you are not able to do anything Frame drops are really common in EA games but spikes like these cannot be acceptable I do not recomend getting too close to the enemy player as you might experience tearing gtx 1060 i7 700hq 16gb ram playing on medium setting and framerates jump from 80 fps to 25 in split of a second4Im solo player and luckily for me there is a first person mode for solo players as well In my opinion third person view in games like this has no place as it breaks the immersion giving huge advantage when peaking  around corners  or checking area around youEngaging head to head in stealthy playstyle isnt the best option I was able to win by stalking players circling and killing them from behindThis is the game when you dont know if you want to recommend it or notIf you add other problems like banning stream killers bugs and glitcher texture loading problems and poor performance its easy to not recommend this game But thats fine its early access for now But how can game developer make micro transactions and make esports tournaments when game is not even finnished thats beyond me ridiculous some would sayIf you like gun blazing hunting players engagin in combat head on and enjoying game as it is I recommend it for you If you are sneaky like me enjoying stealthy playstyle Its hard to recommend this game,negative

This game is Fun but there are many problems with it that need to be adressedPros A lot of fun with or without friendsNot full price  By full price I mean console game retail price like maye 50 60 dollars ishCons and things that are just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tYou can get banned for  Stream sniping  which is basically watching a stream to find where the streamer is and kill them There is no way to prove this or not so any butthurt streamer can report you and get you banned for just killing them in game sometimes the devs ban you without even checking the proof or anythingyou can also get banned for  Harrasment  which is understandable you should be banned or harrasing someone on mic but apparently some people have been banned for honking the horn of a vehicle repeatedly at someone Which is just absurdSo basically the reporting system is just terrible some butturt LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  online can get you banned because you beat them in game So if you feel like being an LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  stream on twitch get killed in game and get someone banned who probably doesn t even know you re streamingStream sniping doesn t even make sense at all There are delays on streams making it hard to find exactly in game where someone is so unless someone is camping you cant really use this to your advantageI would call out the dev team for this but they could ban me for that which is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stupid,positive
unoptimized piece of shitcode that was meant to be 10guess what it still works like crap not only it still has the performance issues but the connection itself sucks an enormous gorrila sLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  sometimes you can t even reconnect to the match due to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing i don t know what graphics in the game are just bad for some reason developers find toxicity in colours and over darkened or lightened interiorsexteriors nice but I personally just get sick of it why won t you just make it look natural without adding that much of bloom and hdr effects with some dumb filter on top of it from time to time the loading screen does not disappear even after the game has been loaded I can hear all the surrounding sounds my fps counter is reacting to the environment I can move turn around jump out of the plane but I still can t see LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the only thing I can observe is the game s logo what is wrong with this game  why are developers so lazy to do ANYTHING right ,negative

great game but unoptimized af dont recommend buying it if you have a trash pc,positive
Just have fun Game is indeed still badly optimized  sometimes frames lower than 60 with a 1080 at 1080pand most settings at very low except AA and some other key settingsSure the bans for tking and stream sniping should be followed up betterHow the game will turn out I don t knowBut i do know that the game is fun as hell if you re not into game with too much actionlike battlefield 1 or codOnly negative side so far is the blurred out look of the base gameWith a program like reshade it already looks 10 times better with minimal performance lossComparison  https youtubenC03IYCamDEOther than that play the game for funStop playing games to look for problems Mail them Twitter them idcFeedback is important but theres just soo much complaining on steam    ,positive

Love this game YES it is tilting when you spend a while looting and then run out of a building and die immediately but there is no better feeling than driving to a loot crate and killing people and gettting an AWM with a ghille suit or making top tenwinning Haven t had as much fun playing any other game as I have playing PUBG,positive

alright To start it off THEY NEED TO MAKE LVL 3 HELMETS MORE COMMON i swear they arent even much better then a LVL 1 vest and they come 120 30 games Why make them so rare while something with the same armour value is extremely commmon Alright 192 hours in and i am still starving Yet to have my chicken dinner and what do i see I CAN BUY A CASE Something this game completely needed on top of the 30 price tag Btw every case has absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in it so overall you cant get a coat without buying it for 80 us but this game is good so i guess i recommend it,positive

Crashes more than any other game I have ever played,negative
I have put almost 300 hours into this game and I absolutely can not recommend it for a variety of reasons 1 Absolute early access hell I bought this game right when it came out and the devs constantly showed their lack of interest in the playerbase after they got their money Horrible server desync horrible policies abandoning update schedules and most of all  developing consoles versions of a game that is is EARLY ACCESS for PC players2 Garbage policies I have won MANY games  the majority are screenshotted on my profile but I am by no means a good player I play with the same group of 3 other people EVERY night and I am far from the best but I was greeted on the 9th of September with a YOU ARE BANNED message Other than being not good at the game I play with  5 Mbs down which is purely a detriment to me as I often lag beyond the point of playing not the game s fault It is almost like they just ban everyone that has been reported which leads me to my next point3 The community is garbage The streamers  Stonemountain etc are whiny unfunny losers who whine and complain when things don t go their way It got to the point where players would honk the horns of their vehicles around streamers and the would get banned for  Stream sniping even though there is no way to tell a non teammate s identity without killing them This is an absolutely ridiculous policy If you don t want people coming and trying to bring some comedy to your unfunny stream with a disproportionate amount of players viewing  don t stream And if that means you stop collecting your NEETbucks and go get a job that is just how it is Don t get me wrong there are a lot of talented and funny streamers but the fact that their complaining can ruin the experience IE ban other players that have no idea what is going on is ludicris4 Balance is an issue The loot spawns are incredibly disproportionate and there becomes a point  like in several Battle Royale games   where the RNG completely takes away skill or lack thereof I have landed in places like Tunnels shelter Crater prison and gotten 0 weapons or armor but one person that enters a small shack gets a Kar98k and headshots both me and my partner No developers actually seem to be interacting with the loot balance in a positive way instead choosing to add weapons to airdrops like the Groza which differ very mildy from other more common weapons5 Vehicle movement is glitchy and annoying I can t stress how many times that my team and I have been driving through the  hand modelled  fields outside of poLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i and had our UAZ jeep like vehicle completely tip over and injure all of us This sometimes even costed us a match we had a likelyhood to win The best solution to make a only the most logical response to tipping a military vehicle  throw a frag grenade at it and get in AFTER the esplosion so that the car can magically tip itself over again  damaged but driveableThese issues are only scraping the top of the barrel with the issues with this game I imagine I will get several responses stating to  leave the game alone it is in early access  but to that I say this  Early access is a scam With the exeption of a few absolute gems it has been nothing other then a cheap scheme where  optimistic  developers cash on on the hype for the game and then slowely fade away into obscurity leaving the game to die Despite what PLAYERUNKNOWN says the have already abandoned some of their schedules for much needed updates and fixes that would make the game playable but instead they choose to develope console versions ban innocent players and act like they anything other than stealing the money for a project that will likely never come to a finish as the playerbase reaches 1 million people that jumped on a hype train It was fun at times but this ban and all of the garbage the push on the playerbase is completely unacceptable and if I could get a refund I would in a heartbeatedit  I am currently unbanned My review will still remain negative The fun I had and the hours I put into thius game outside of the first month or so were with friends The enjoyment I had was not really because of the game but the people  i was with This game CAN be fun I never said it couldn t I simply stated the way things are from the point of view of someone who has actually put enough time into the game to have well rounded opinion If you are with friends and want to kill people go for it this might be a decent game for you,negative

Could be a good game looks like the developers have given up trying to improve the game instead trying to capitalise on microtransactions As if they haven t made enough from an alpha release already The game is teeming with hackers obvious from the off chance they exist on steam that they already have VAC bans in other titles Lag is always intense no matter how good your connection and those furthest away from you geographically seem to get an advantage despite their huge latency,negative

This game is amazingly enjoyable but this game is so buggy My review will change once the game fixes these bugs My game has crashed almost everytime I have opened it Haven t played it too much but very difficult to do that if it will not open I suggest playing on EU servers  If you re in NA because they aren t nearly as buggy The game runs much better on EU servers so yea,negative
This game is still very buggy and on more than one occassion my character has been killed before the buildings around me even rendered This has a lot of potential and the premise of the game is the only reason I purchased it but even with a mid level gaming laptop on the lowest graphic settings it s unplayable half of the time sheerly because of lag and a poor server connection Every other game runs fine on my computer including the new Destiny 2 Beta on Medium graphic settings but this one it just never works properly There s a 5050 chance I actually get to play each round,negative
Firstly  I recommend this game but in the same time i don tWhy i recommend it  Playing with friends if fun Playing it by yourself is fun if you know all the tricks and you can shoot pretty wellWhy i don t  Bugs  Alot of bugs For example  i think the motorcycle is the biggest bug in this game You can t even drive it well on a hill and it crashes very fast I don t like the thing that Devs and teaming with the streamers There are some who are sniping and some who don t For the ones who don t  how the h3ll should we know that they are streamers  You have like no proof to prove that we are stream sniping  i m saying for those who don t Yet you ban us for no reason  I m not banned but maybe i will be soon  because of the 1d1ot devs I don t like the thing that i can t see where the shoots are coming from This is very unpleasant in some moments For example  someone is shooting my squad from a forest and he has a flash hider  How the hell can i see him  I can t Not that this would be a big problem  because when i spot players i can shoot them and they can t see me  Yes  i m John Cena But still When sometimes when i go in squad play  the game spawns me alone and no one is on my team Yet the other teams are squads SO it s pretty much like 1v4  if i encounter any squads It s not optimized I had an old pc with gtx 750ti and amd fx 8310  8 gb ram On this setup  it should work fine because what i had is better than the minimum requirments Way better But guess what  i couldn t move the camera when i jumped out of the plane  i had like 1 fps or 2 So basically the game froze untill i managed someway to get on ground When i was on ground  the buildings were so untextured if this word even exists that i couldn t even get inside of them so i had to wait like 30sec to a minute for it to texture Remember that i had decent pc specsThen i could enter the buildings but in the most cases i get killed by players who already got a gun before me,positive

You may or may not even enjoy your first few hours playing this game If you stick with it then you ll only get frustrated with the poor RNG hackers losing half your health to your parachute glitching and the fact that you ll die more to zones then to actual players  When they update things it won t be updates that actually help game playability So you re better off saving your money for a different battle royal,negative
This game is half rng half broken code but whichever it is it s fun This game still needs a LOT of updates and I don t see it ever being perfect It s mobile version is supposedly better I m sure you ve seen it on twitch if not go and watch it The age of reviews have long since passed for games like thishttps twitchtvdirectorygamePLAYERUNKNOWN S 20BATTLEGROUNDSRecommended if you like buggy battle royales,positive

oi nah ladsfun game just yar average early access game really pretty buggy looks alright runs nicenot really optimised but its early access what do you expectBit of a rip off for 26 until they actually bring out more features maps and weapons and especially when mods come out and then i suppose itll be worth its full price,positive
i do think that terrian should play more of a role i as more small cliffs that drop down into a heavy foliagethat are so dense that you have to commit to the foliage to be able to see in the ravine heavy grass doesnt countbut it does and doesn t because of distancethe open spaces are WAY to plentifuleither add more inbetween or do ravines with the normal grassehh its perfect i think n then some extra thick double up grass that is actually green green not that seeweed LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  so that first person you would really stand if you wanted to see properly over itbut while crouch moving you could see somewut but you would have to stand to actually check just grass and hedgerows plz and at a distance plz remember that grass doesnt load inso if you do make foliage make it to were there are some spots that can abuse thisbut mostly dont allow for grass rendering distances to ruin your foliage ares cuz its wayyyyy to under tree d ,positive

All about the Journey PUBG is one of the if not THE most exciting game ive played in a long timeThe adrenaline rush felt after arriving to the final top 10 skirmish always delivers It s the prize of a tense yet enjoyable experience ive yet to encounter in another game  This sense of hunt far surpasses the need of actually winning   its all about the ever changing journey8810 for me already will be at least a 9510 when it leaves Early Access an becomes a full fledged game,positive
Fantastic game Love how they managed to really capture the tension and atmosphere of a true battle royale game,positive

Surprisingly this game never let me raging and quiting It has something that leaves you wanting more and more kinda addicting i love it The optimization is acceptable not horrible just acceptable  GTX 1060 6Gb i5 7600k Some people can manage to have the guts to play alone i can t I find it to much stressfull Oh and if you want an adrenaline rush if you get to top10 you ll have a run for your money The only down side to this game is that you don t get rewards enough you get GP points And you open crates It misses some kind of dayly reward or something VISUAL  810AUDIO  1010OVERALL  8510,positive

don t buy this at least not in it s current statethe game is ugly first of all and hard to run for some reason you need very low settings for high frame rate even then you won t hit 144fps the game is laggy espacially at the most important moments like the begining of the game or in busy areas which results in LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  combat  speaking of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  combat the combat is dumb of course compared to good games like battlefield or cs go or even insurgency plus there is no practice range or mode your only experiance well be gained from fighting the guy who s camping some house or the one who s running across the field and maybe sometimes you re the one running and finally microtransactions ohh baby those people promised to not make microtransactions untill the game is fully realesed and they broke that promise you know what else those people are promising   to actually fully realese this game lol this game well stay in early access forever,negative

Battle Royale games have potential PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds has potential From buying this game to playing it I haven t stopped playing it since I always have that need to play games like this But of course this is a review and reviews need to be compiled of constructive criticism Korean developers Bluehole have done a good job of simulating a different unique type of game combining forms of group tactical play to the fast paced get out and survive thrillThe mechanics of shortening safe zones really does give off a tense vibe and I can see it was designed for that but also to stop campers These mechanics of shortening safe zones has become the heart of PUBG and is what makes the game function Dropping from the plane descending from the air and scouting out your drop zone makes you feel more in control of your surroundings and gives that extra feel of relief to find that SKS on the floor or a level 3 helmet Playing within your own group of friends really does make the game more exciting and satisfying Without taking it seriously we can run on the fields near butt naked one with his afro bouncing around like a rabbit on heroin The tense feeling being held up in a building with your friends hearing a jeep or a bike louring near you really can give you some sense of fear or even the unknown footsteps that grow nearer and nearer to which could be your imminent endAll of these moments experienced is what makes a good game succeed But of course the time to be critical is nowNever mind my over zealous descriptions of this game as with any  Early Access  game problems will arise bugs will be found and unfairness will exist Now i quote  Early Access  for a reason from my experience i haven t come across major issues in conjunction to bugs or unfairness The game has been incredibly smooth with hardly any issues now of course that can be down to my mad setup that i run on however it is very difficult to maintain a smooth experience when releasing games under the Early Access banner And for that i do applause Bluehole IncThe one thing that frustrates me more is paying for cosmetics Saving money to buy the game and attempting to reach top 10 out of 100 is hard enough Of course you may just say they re cosmetics however cosmetics that give some form of camouflage within the map can lead to an advantage over others I ve always disliked the  Pay to Win  marketing strategies that nearly all major game developers force in our faces I d feel happier to pay a Monthly Fee if everything i get within the game is available to me Content is important and limiting content for customers will always shed a bigger negative impact within the gaming community and it s something that needs to be considered and thought about regularly If what Chris Roberts does with Star Citizen succeeds you can rest assure that many gaming companies like Bluehole Inc will go bust It s important to develop in the eyes of a consumer rather than develop in the eyes of a developerOn the topic of cosmetics I can roam the world and find Gas masks and Protective goggles Now I admit on the cosmetic side they look pretty bad LOVE LOVE LOVE  however if certain clothing like Gas masks and protective goggles are to be shown within the game they should present more meaning rather than  look cool  I d want to be able to defend myself from flash bangs with protective goggles or if poisonous  gases were added defend myself using a gas mask This would ensure a more tactical and survival thrill to when you hit that top 5 in a SquadOverall I have to say despite some negatives the game itself as an  Early Access  game has proven to deliver in the majority of it s goals The tense combat and tactical elements Bluehole Inc wanted to achieve have been achieved the Safe Zone and Dead Zone features is what adds brings the game together alongside anticipating your perfect Skydive for the best tools to do the job If BlueHole continue to deliver an exhilarating and fun experience to PUBG then i will be excited to see what the finished and continued updates this product has to deliver,positive
This is a really good game but theres two things i dont like The first is how long the down timer lasts and the second is how many times you can get downed It should be a one and done get downed once ok but the second time you should just be dead,positive
It s fun to play with friends and stuff but I can t take it how people just camp in a house If your gonna play this game solo I don t recommend it If your gonna play with friends its more exciting It s way to Slow paced,negative
Overall Score  910 1 for lack of gun variety and only one map  I ll edit my review whenif the devs add moreIf you re a 1st or 3rd person shooter fan you should definitely try this game out  It s especially fun to play with friends,positive
It can t be right that players can get banned for sniping and killing streamersReally disgusting way of handling thingsIt is obviously the streamers own fault It doesn t even matter if people are watching the stream following the streamer and killing them or if they are simply in the game killing enemiesThat s the risk you carry as a streamerBut really there s such an easy solution Delay your god damns streams for a few minutes How hard can that be SeriouslyShame on admins for banning people on reasons like this,negative

OK So this is how it goes Lots of player good concept but So full of issues and exploits that really until it gets a full release leave it alone Or better still wait for Version 2 FYI for all the crackheads who want to say this is the greatest and believe me there are heaps of crackstars in this game just play on a weekday I got myself to a respectable 250 in OC so go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE yourselfSO many issues so so many Audio is poor  direction sucks badly Weapons are either OP or Soft as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Map has major issues with Prone blocking on hillside Game stutter happens at random time during game play and in lobby Building dropped items don t spawn until after you enter and run past and then turn around and WOW stuff on the ground I know 1M people cant be wrong but it will be the figget spinner of Sept 2017 and the SD will take the money and put it into the new version to so they can resell it to you Don t be a sucker find a better game experience than this,negative

Can t recommend it until the devs get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together It s a hideously unoptimized resource hog and the devs are banning people in early access largely because they ve either found bugs or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off a streamer by killing him Completely unacceptable I ll be avoiding Bluehole from here on,negative

I love this gameI was a H1Z1 player before I jumped on the PUBG train and the main problem I had with H1Z1 was the lack of anything but iron sights  aside from the sniper rifle and the horrible weapon balancing Never in my life have I won a game of H1Z1 the closest I ve come was a 1v1 where I was gunned down instantlyHowever it s a different story in PUBGI love the fact that you can find attachments during the game and mix and match them on your weapons especially because you can get suppressors for your gunsIt feels a lot better to have anything from a red dot sight to a 15x scope instead of being forced to use iron sights only across long distancesTo me the guns feel quite balanced right nowPUBG feels like anyone has a chance of winning mainly because it comes down to luck with looting and safezone placement but also requires basic gun skill and good judgement You could hide for most of the game and still end up within the top 10Not only is the gameplay decent but this game is semi playable on terrible hardware Before I bought a gaming desktop I used to game on a 5 year old Dell laptop When I played PUBG on the lowest settings  Which looks decent for low I was still about to pull about 40 FPS on a Geforce 840m 1GB with 8GB of RAM and a pretty terrible CPU I did have trouble with buildings loading in slowly and I m pretty sure I cut that laptop s lifetime down by playing the game but it was playable and it s where I got my first squad win  On the day I bought the gameOverall I ve had a lot of positive experiences in this game but I ve also had experiences where my friend thinks it s hilarious to smack me with a pan it usually ends with him on the ground at the end of my gun or with me having to use a first aid kit but I d do it all again because we get some great laughs out of our misadventures and a lot of funnycrazy stories that we recount,positive

I deleted this game ages ago from my library I saw updates and was thinking I would give it another shot but WOW the game is even worse then before 0 improvement on the hit reg 0 effort from this trash LOVE LOVE LOVE  developer team Oh we need to focus on putting out new maps guns and dumb things like grips It is just falling even further down the trash can,negative

I get killed by a cheater about 50  of the time when I play this game Reporting the player only does so much I think a better way to combat cheaters would be to directly link them to the player s steam profile   that way if you report them they get worse punishment Right now I feel like you have to cheat in order to stand a chance against the cheaters I love this game but I had to uninstall it,negative

This game is funWell it s more than just fun It s an amazing 1st3rd person game that sends chills running down your spine when you hear the shots zip by you A new way to look at any multiplayer fight for all types of games Great alone and wonderful with othersThere s just one problem The unfortunate problem that breaks the balance of the entire gameYou see there is a three part system that makes this game what it is The RNG Your skill and the circle RNG and the amount of skill you have determines your place in the game The strategies you choose falls under the skill catagory and what guns and other items falls under RNG If you know the works of this game and get good items you have a high chance of getting to higher ranks If you aren t skilled and you get bad items quite the opposite will happen If you get good items and have no skill you ll be middle etcThe circle is the force part of the game just like how game such as COD Black Ops has a point system that keeps things intresting You re forced to go to the circle or you ll die outside of the playing area and I m sure no one wants to choose the latter So what can make this game so bad  You ask unaware of the one big tumor that s sucking the life out of this game like a leech and ruining the well balanced triangular system And that of course is known to all known pros as the REPORT BUTTON There are a lot of games that have a system which uses a report mehcanism A good example is a game called Dead By Daylight which is a fairly balanced game if you play it correctly  however the report is for the ones that don t The reason why the report button doesn t work in PUBG is because half of the time you die you don t even know how  unlike in Dead By Daylight when you die you alawys know how it happened and you can tell if there is foul play afoot Because of this some innocent person can be reported or even BANNED yes banned because someone was having a bad day and got shot at the wrong timeVideo games are supposed to be fun but no one can have any if this button keeps existingI know I haven t played this game for a long time and this problem has never affected me before but the looming danger of it compelled me to write this problem down and share it to the public The creators and game devs that are working for this NEED to fix this problem and the reviews are starting to give this gem of a game a bad reputation And I know they re working on other important things such as the new map and weapons that are coming out but if they want to make sure that their users continue enjoying this game then they need to fix this I am going to give one reccomendation  move the report button to the main menusettings and allow the use of copying and pasting names once you have died or have won in the game so when you go back to the main menu you will have a chance to paste the name of the offender in a message along with a quick summary of what they did I believe this will lower the amount of reports in the game because it is less conviententPUBG is and will always be known for it s great gameplay  or it will be if they fix the report system Thank you for reading this,positive
As of the current state of the game I cannot reccomend it There are way to many glitches and bugs  and some features that are just utter LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yes I realize it s early access but I feel like at the top of the  To Do  list should be fixing the firing glitch Not even 5 minutes before writing this I come out of a building and I see someone waiting for me Armed with my S12K I line up the iron sights to my opponents head and I click the LMB Nothing happens I click it again still nothing happens Gun was fully loaded with 5 shells in it But this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing glitch makes my gun not shoot and my opponent kills me Glitches that ruin the game like this one should be fixed as soon as possible And it s not just this There s the fact that people can get left behind on the starting island or if someones textures don t load they can drive through walls in a car But it s not only glitches that make this game not worth buying It s some features too Like the whole  Outside of Playzone  crap Yes it s good that you make the playzone smaller it makes the games go much faster because it would take a very long time to find the last person in a massive map but you can t out run the playzone barrier If you re not already inside the Playzone you ll be able to maybe loot a couple of houses when the game first starts before you have to focus on constantly moving to the Playzone You get shot and need to search houses for a First Aid Kit  Too bad you don t have enough time And then if you get caught outside the playzone  Well good luck surviving You re health slowly deteriorates and you have no time to heal You have to keep moving and pray that you can get back into the Playzone before the barrier starts moving again It s a load of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  The only way to outrun the playzone is to find a car and good luck being able to consistently do that In it s current state this game is not nearly worth 30 dollars,negative

Great Game New DayZ Team going full steam with new game to try overthrow this These game needs new map   already feeling antsy and looking for athoer games This single map will keep you pretty satisfied and addicted for 2  3 weeks MaxNeed a way to dual with friends Maybe a 1 x 1 map Maybe  A mode like Capture the flag would go down well  Why Vaulting cant be implemented now is beyond me Still a great game but some basic fixes needed quickly,positive
Game has a good idea but it is like on 50  of production Game is not optimized problems with textures and rendering also lots of bugs This game has potential but at this stage it is just a game that has quite lot of problemsOn top of that this game recently hase huge amount of chiters who aparently can see every player where hi is and almost never miss the target If they banned 15000 players wtf is happening with this new wave of chitters,negative

Really fun game and kills alot of time quickly It is so fun when playing with friends and after 110 hours played i can say that im not bored yet even though there is only one map and we have the new map to look forward to Solo is fun in my opinion if you can play the game half decently It can be a little annoying when you die alot but if you give it a few days you will get to grips with the game It does need optimising but im sure it will improve in the future from what i have seen the developers are really good with the game apart from the microtransactions Overall i do think you should buy the game but if non of your friends have it and you re not sure let the game improve before you get it If you like gameplay defenetly get it and especially with your friends,positive
This game is actually terrible,positive
this games is a very interesting battle royal style game with amazing features parallel to the real world functions of in depth fire arm shooting and fighting to be at the top of the leader board though i would like to have some improvements in the future of fixing servers being laggy although trying every region in addition to  having a strong Lan cable attached to my PC and bugs such as motor cycles flying in the sky because of random landscape issues and also dead bodies inside a vehicle starting to spasm for unknown reasons overall i love this game and i cant wait to see some changes in the near future 3333,positive

So since my last review of this game  some things have changed Some for the better and others not so much The streamers getting whatever they want issue has   to a point been handled But now the big issues is cheaters and hackers I hear region locking is coming and only time will tell just how well it works out A easy fix to the remaining hacker issues   after region locking is to do something that most people will hate But it will work And that is to make every item that is earned via a chest account bound After opening a chest the items will not be allowed to be put on the steam market and the hackers will have no way to make money off of the game Because most hackers and cheaters do what they do in games such as PUBG and H1Z1 so that they can earn the max in game currency and then sell any items earned from that on the market to make real life cash I know this is not going to be a popular viewpoint  but it would work This game still gets a NO vote from me untill i see how region locking works out If it helps the game  i would be happy to change it to a thumbs up,negative

Hello I purchased this product and can not play it I will be happy to solve the problem,positive
Great concept and great game I m no good at it yet but I can t put it down As millions of people are playing it world wide at any one time gameplay can be interesting at times in a glitchy sort of way I have gotten to the top top 10 many times but still yet to get that chicken dinner There are so many play styles and tactics you can adopt and that is the fun of this game Just the fact that you are playing against up to 99 other real players keeps you on your toes Games are often over quite quickly and you are left feeling let down angry andor stupid That also makes you a better playerIt is often claimed that this game is full of cheaters and hackers I don t necessarily agree with this You are often surprised and killed wondering how the hell did heshe do that  Your computer and internet specs play a big part of the playability of this game If you have a poor performance machine with not so good internet I wouldn t recommend going head to head in a gun battle with another player unless the odds and surprise are stacked in your favour Even then it may not end well for you But you can still do well using other tactics such as sneaking around ambushing andor surviving to the top 10I m not that good at this game but that does not mean that it is anything less than one of the most awesome games that I have ever purchased and played Highly recommended,positive
DA BEST,positive
I love the game But it seems the devs are siding with streamers on everything Just because people play the game different eg camping having fun by honking horns etc they shouldn t be banned Stop sucking off the streamers and act equally towards every player Until I stop hearing about this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  happening to people my review will be negative,negative
PLAYERUNKNOWN S CRATE SIMULATOR,negative
I think i Have never writed a review on steam but on this game i need to writeThis game is insane i ve been playing games on my whole life and in the last year i didn t find any game that keep me playing for a lot of conssecutive hours having fun nad with tension and adrenaline at max that any mistake you make and you re dead you don t pay attention and you re dead seriously i ve played DayZArmaand all the others but because of the open map it always got boring but not this because the blue circle in the mapsrsly buy this game and play but the best tip is  u re never alone and if you mistep you diebougth saturday 7 00 PMmonday 2 00 am i had already 27 hours of gameplay in this1010 got killed by blue ray,positive
its soo fun and hard im totally in to it,positive
Das Spiel ist toll aber es buckt lagt und hngt sich bei mir oft aufEs ist neulich gecrasht und seit dem kann ich es nicht mehr spielen 4 von 5 Sternen,positive
If you like taking many MANY years off of your life from the stress this game gives your heart go ahead and get it you little suicide monkeyTL DR I recommend this but take warning  the ban hammer is loose in this community  Don t honk your horn too much a streamer might be near by and hurt their sensitive little ears  Don t try to shoot out of most windows or near railings Really strange and EFFING ANNOYING FRIGGIN things happen But really though this is a fun game that has some of my best gaming moments and I ve only  ONLY lol played 40 hours It really helps if you play with friends or even randoms in a Squad gameThat s not to say that it will also drive you up the wall mad sometimes There are hackers here but it is honestly pretty rare so good job devs and PunkBuster but my point about windowswindow sillsrailings still apply avoid them at all costs,positive
First off I know game is still in early access BUT there are so many game breaking bugs that HAD to be adressed before releasing game for public playA guy is driving a car in school through walls and just getting free kills sometimes LMB doesnt register at all so you just end up aiming at enemy without being able to shoot him  sometimes it actually worksWhen you land with parachute textures are still loading so all you can do is just wait and hope you dont get killed because you cant even see house doors and I had everything on high and on low same thing happensNOT TO MENTION 30 game with microtransactions players getting banned because they killed streamerRegret spending money on thisTL DR Dont buy game yet not worth it maybe when they polish it Game is overhyped,negative
Well done Bluehole you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up,negative
I have never had a kill after weeks of playing but this game really is fun and exciting so I highly recomend it,positive
Edited  5192018The only way this game will get better is if the devs rebuild it from the ground up But that would require them to actually work instead of blatantly exploiting people for money The only positive about this game is that its popularity has inspired more ethical developers to make better battle royale games Please do not buy this game please do not support these devs,negative
approve,positive
Here is my thoughts on this game so far after giving a good shot so farPros  A good game to play with friendsNo in game chat Lets the player to focus on gameplay instead of typing all the timeGets your adrenaline going for sureCons Vehicles are really frustrating tbh especially if you into fences or anything that breaks It becomes Clunky af Getting stuck in world structures when droppingFriendly fire especially from randoms who rage,positive

PUBG esta muriendose lentamente no porque sea malo el juego si no por la falta de updates para arreglarlo bugs de sonido que te joden la partida haciendote creer que un pibe esta a la izquierda y alfinal te mataron de la derecha tiros que no llegan a registrar y su bajo tickrate jode todo Otro aspecto malo es como se desarrollan las partidas al se vuelven re aburridas al cabo de un tiempo El mapa Miramar es un asco al ser tan grande nisiquiera se llega a aprovechar el 40  del mapa espero que esto se arregle con el nuevo mapa 4x4 dicho esto el problema mas grave son los crasheos hoy tuve como 4 antes de empezar a jugar despues volvio todo a la  normalidad  tambien que te tenes que reconectar a cada rato es muy rompe bolas Con razon Fornite esta ganando mas gente y popularidad igual ganan tanta popularidad al pagar youtubers a que promocionen su juego Pubg is E sports Ready lul,negative
I strongly recommend PUBG as a game you should all buy still some issues with optimisations But my GTX 645 and 8GB of DDR3 Memory runs the game at far render distance and low settings At 30 this is the best game that is listed on steam and i will continue to stand by that   JAYEMDUB 1010,positive
THE BEST GAME,positive
I m pretty good at finding shotgun sEven better at finding playersEven Even better at dying without a chance of getting a word in edge ways1010 though it s fun I enjoy it Better with friends rather than alone,positive
This game is pretty good Also very frustrating but if you play it correctly then it s very fun Those bans that people were talking about only come as a result from being a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  person in the game For instance if you are in a squad or working in pairs then killing your partners to steal from them is probably not being a good player So if you re a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  person  bad attitude then this game wont be good for you I applaud and support the DEVS banning people for these reasons,positive
could use binoculars in game as well as replay just to see from where I got killed,positive
You can tell from my hours of playing this game This game has potential it has the potential to go beyond over  known titled game  I spent a lot of my time playing games but this game reeled me in   I can spend time interacting with people   The market of this game helps know the basic concepts of  buy and sell   due to the overpriced items  The basic tactics and strategy of surviving   Developers who knows common courtesy of having a good community  Developers who manage to keep hackers away from dominating the game,positive
This game is really amazing,positive
Plunkbat finally got a ping lock and other stuff to deal with hackers and it s noticeable so hats of to you Plunk and the Plunkbat teamPlunkbat is a shooty game where you go around collecting guns and other guff and try to be the last guy standing and on the way you want to Plunk as much players as possible to get that Winner Winner Plunkbat DinnerI rate this game  Plunk  10,negative

The gameplay is fun at the times im not lagging out of my mind due to vary poor optimizeation Only get this if you have a monster PC and like a slow skill based game that still has bugs in its early access stage and just like any other game there are way to many people from china coming to our servers and ruin the team based asset of the game due to not knowing what there saying or them trolling So i rate this a 510 needs alot of work still,negative

This game is honestly trash the developers don t keep their word with this game  we arent adding mico transactions untilthe games full release  This game has so many stupid bugs its annoying and bothersome The game is overall trash and I would not reccomend buying it The game has a crap ton of desyncing isssues like getting shot through a wall our a house and people get stuck in the walls and are practically in god mode Please do yourself a favor and don t buy this game ever Nothing better than landing before someone and picking up the gun the gun doesnt register in your inventory and the guy lands nexts to you and picks up the gun,negative

too many hackers fun game but 50  are cheating,negative
I ve been playing battle royale games since the original DayZ mod so the idea of battle royale is pretty near and dear to my heart  it s one of the things that got me into PC gaming in the first place PUBG is janky it isn t perfect and it never will be but that s okay The intensity that you feel in almost every single match you play can t be matched by any game out on the market right now The adrenaline that courses through you when you see another player and quickly have to decide how to handle the situation is such an amazing feeling and it s amplified tenfold when you pull your plan off successfully and bring home that chicken dinner They are adding new maps fairly frequently however I think they should be adding more weapons and making more balance changes to keep the gameplay more fresh  something Fortnite does far better All in all if you are looking for a more realistic battle royale game this should be your go to or if you don t like the building in Fortnite but enjoy the game concept then defintely try out PUBG 910 for me,positive
Really nice game,positive
Great Game Very NOICE Never gonna get bored with this game Better than Gabe s Games LMAO,positive

Don t listen to salty kids People don t get banned for no reason  The  microtransactions  are in every game these days and provide no benefit The game is actually fairly well optimized if you have an actual gaming rig you know like most intelligent working people would have when they do something for a hobby Even my buddy on a 1050 says it runs greatJust a bunch of losers jumping on a bandwagon to complain because that s what snowflakes who have no life experience and nothing better to do with their lives will doHands down the best most intense shooter I ve ever playerd I ve been gaming for 20 years my group is all a bunch of old salty dinosaurs and every single one of them likes it Even my buddies wife is hardcore into it with him,positive

This game has so many inconsistencies It s ridiculous The fact that you can point blank AR spray someone down when they have a shotgun and shoot you point blank and the shotgun spread passes through them is so ridiculous Also the fact that cars trip up on invisible LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing miniscule tiny rocks is stupid as well They have a long way to go here,negative
This game is fantastic However theres lots of silly things that have been left out or things that need to be fixed Here s a basic list of what I do not like so far1 You can t tell where you have been shot after you ve been hit2 Footsteps are WAAAYYY too loud  Even when crouching3 Parachute mechanics are a little weird  though I am hopeful as its still early access4 Punching should not kill you so easily5  probably the first to say it but Helmets and body armor should protect you more  it makes sense realisticallyBut overall this game is fantastic and has really been knocked out of the park I really can not wait until its optimized and finished,positive
The only early access game worth buying Devs keep updating each monthy  although sometimes delayed More tactical version of H1Z1 if you re in to that,positive
Fantastic game,positive

Still a work in progress However i can honestly say that i ve bought games for a whole lot more not only that but they have been poorly madeneeds dlc to help fix with that beeing said this game does need patch updates but they do happen all the time and its slowly becoming better and better week by week trust me its worth the 40 bucks if you are into FPS games as well as online competitive style fighting then this is for you,positive

So i love playing PUBGand i think most of us likebut in this recension i wanna say some negative aspectsIn the day i write this recension i went to sosnovka military base and i was having no buildings and wallsbut when i was in a place where a building should be i was getting stuckbut i was able to see lootand i was somehow in a building near a window and someone started shooting at mei panicated and i went right and the player stopped shootingthen i started shooting and somehow i got teleported near the player and i killed himi think this isn t fairbecause this was a game bug and i feel bad for that playerThen a few hrs after my game crashed when i was in the planeand when i tryed to enter back and continue the game with my friends i couldn t because it was saying connection lostAnd when i get in games i have some sword of bugs and the buildings look really stupi and in my screen it looks like im floating or somethingbut not in all games i joinBut the game is really fun 2 play with your friends or soloIt in my opinion the best game with 3rd person1st person gameplayIt has a nice battle royale ideea and some cool graphicsAnd i hope the devs will solve the problems i mentioned above to improve the gameplay,positive

if you ignore the loot stuff i d say great game some snobs down there think it ruins the game but it s literally the same as with tf2 sure you could argue that you already spent 30 on the game but then i can just say  well csgo is just like that but a bit cheaper  but then you say  but this is early release  to which i say  well thats the time to be doing this so you can raise money to make your servers better so yes game is good TL DR  yeah i d say it s a great game,positive
This game is fantastic and I only expect it to get better,positive
mantap,positive
This game will be amazing It s got a brilliant map great weapons and gameplay loop that constantly makes you choose between time safety loot and kills However it is at this moment early access For an early access game it is in pretty good shape The devloper is behind it and seems to making improvements with every update That having been said  it s also an un optimized mess in a lot of ways right now With lots of inconsistencies that are incredibly frustrating If those things get fixed this game will get a full on two thumbs endorsement But right now  it lacks the polish of a finished game so buyer beware If you don t mind that  like I don t then go right ahead buy this game and welcome aboardBe warned  because for people who are less familiar with the world of early access or how devlopment works the game in it s current state might be upsetting,positive
This is my 4th Battle Royale game and PUBG is the best in this genre so far as you can tell by the Twitch viewer countBut this is still an Early access and it is unoptimized buggy laggy CQC and crashesfreezes a lot for me and my friends with good PC s While it is fun to play it s not fun when you can t play   Early Access or not the game should be at least playableGlad this genre got so popular maybe one day we will get a proper BR game,positive
instant errection,positive
One of the best and most enjoyable games ever made to date gives you adrenaline rushes like no other game with the tense gunfights attempting to come out on top Highly recommended most reviews complain about BUGS in a EARLY ACCESS game but even so the dev team is one of the best i have ever seen and always iron out as many bugs as possible on a regular basis while always bringing out new content which is why the game is so successful I couldn t recommend a better game out there right now Piece of advice  don t teamkill or you may recieve a temp ban  EDIT  A lot of negative reviews are also complaining about streamers getting them banned this is their own fault as if you read the rules of conduct on the battlegrounds page i quote  Do not stream snipe  this is a form of cheating and you will be banned if you do it I also have a lot more hours on this game and have 200 I just family share it to my other account so this review is from quite a lot of experience,positive
this game is the best,positive
Trash Every Update ruins the game even more,negative
Very Addictive,positive

Great game to play with friends,positive
I dont understand why they have to make the private match a beta and only availiable to certain people I wish that they would let us do what we want than why not open it to public And anotherthing I want to touch base on is why are people getting banned for no reason you need proof that people were harassing you not just people saying so A friend of mine got banned for thus stupid sht I think this is going to be a waste of my money,negative

Idk if it s only my comp but I have a 1k gaming comp and whenever I jump out of map and parachute no structure is loaded so I get intense lag for minutes  Know that at this time I have landed and vulnerable just standing there Sometimes it even crashes but for the times it doesn t crash it would give me these ugly buildings that I can go through It starts to glitch me out when I go through it tooThe game is fun just very very unplayable for me,negative

This game is broken However it does  sort of sooth the itch for a MMO survival battle royale Its fundamentally broken I dont recommend it because unless you poor endless hours of your life into it Youll never win If you do win its pure luck Skill is irrelevant because the physics and mechanics of shooting are broken hits go unrecognized and no matter your angle you will hit doors walls windows rocks trees the ground but never your target even when your crosshair is dead on them and the small red dot that alerts you when youre going to hit any of the objects named above is not there When wearing a level 3 helmet that protects you from one shot head shot kills and painkillers which improves your health and lowers subtly the damage taken they can head shot you when your clear behind a tree and kill you with one shot,negative
The game was great at launch and then the massive cheater wave began The problem is how the game is monetized on the steam market Hackers just cheese the game so much and get so many points to buy massive amounts of crates Then they sell the rare loot on the crates on the steam market and just buy a new key The currency system can remain but it needs to be de monitized In addition people just mask their IPSuse VPNetc and just change their IPs so the bans are never permanent  because again they just buy new keys I ve seen speed hacks wall hacks aimbots instant 1 shot through level three helmet with a pistol and to be honest the game is almost unplayable now because of it I avoid PC shooters for this very reason Perhaps when it comes to Xbox it won t be as riddled with problems but PUBG needs to get this under control because until it does I m telling all my buddies  STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME,negative
Still an unoptimised unbalanced mess Still doesn t have a region lock which  will  mean that playing squad matches mean your teammates will only speak chinese  regardless of the region you select Still a buggy overpriced alpha of a concept Steer clear,negative

PUBG has fixed many problems and still has a few to work on but they have improved a lot since Pre releaseI look forward to more content and hope that they continue to improveI enjoyed the 10v10v10 event matches and I hope they make it a permanent addition  I still recommend a solid state drive ,positive

Extremely entertaining for such an early access game Very promising future Some microtransactions are added in now which is a bit of a touchy subject for many but they are for purely cosmetic clothing anyway Definite yes in my opinion,positive
 Got awesome gear no one around Ran to zone still no one around Keep running to next few circles definitely no one around Top 20 sniped from a mile away by a Kar98k despite having a level 2 helmet1010 would recommend,positive

Worst Game i literally couldnt even start the game and then when i did i enjoyed it for 2 days and then one day i could click any buttons on the main pageFix these bugs i have seen so many people with this GAMEBREAKING bug,negative
The game is tremendous funBut as long as stream sniping is forbidden in the game rules I keep my recommendation at a negative Streaming your play is at your own risk By opening your play up to the public you know people can take advantage of that If you don t want people to take advantage of that you can put a delay in your streamRecommendation also keeps negative as long as banning for  stream honking  keeps being a thingStreamers are not kings and they shouldn t be treated like it,negative
Great fun Exactly what it says on the tin,positive
6 months of Early access and still broken Broken broken Man kind evolved faster than this game And expect any bug reports or online support to fall on deaf earsAlso Devs seem to think its more important to add new content rather than fix its current workStay away stay AWAY,negative
Fun game but still needs work,positive

You fanboys can downvote this review all you want but you can t say it s not trueFirst of all mechanics Gunplay and movement are smoothly done Tons of weapons and attachmentsThe inventory is too complex for the little time you ll be using it which is between battles and when picking up lootGrenades are completely useless 90  of the timeI m jumping in SPACEThe fists melee is basically a punch of a 6 year old with anemiaVehicles with buggy physicsI m sorry but why do we have a windage and elevation mechanic for scopes  Yes I mean we have bullet drop and spread but this game mode doesn t literally let you camp for more than 5 minutes in the same spot without the circle getting smaller Call realism and everything but I feel like this was just over the top and it was not necessary to implement at all and it s basically useless for the little time you could be using it with a x10 scope Have fun zeroing that thing while in battleThey are adding tons of functions just like first person mode that it s not completely built in and it s just a camera put into the third person controller which makes it really bad to handlecontrol Another example is the vaulting mechanic which was needed and requested by so many players and it s still cluncky The overall problem that people want to ignore or would just rather not talk aboutThe battle royale gamemode is not original at all and this game does nothing to make it different to other games that have it tooPeople seem to mistake that this game is intense and fun because they did a great job at making the game but that s just how all battle royale  kind of  games are The credit goes to whoever thought of the battle royale genre originally Yes that old movieExcept this isn t about all originality because at this moment Fortnite Battle Royale is objectively better on every aspect The design there remarkably stands out and it shows clearly that EpicGames knows how to run a game like this meanwhile PUBG Corp is still scratching their heads about what skin container they should make next for when they release the smallest update with hints of  actual development  which is basically just making a map by taking ideas out of reddit and making new weapons without balancing any of them at allThere s bugs compatibility and performance issues as well just like before leaving early access It s been like this ever since it appeared on the market if I recallThere s also no incentive to keep playingThe rewards are incredibly low even when you manage to survive to top 10And even when you win you only get around 13K averageYou can t use the points to unlock anything other than buying cases that could later require a microtransaction key to openAnd just like any other point and click shooter All automatic weapons feel the sameAll semi auto weapons feel the sameAll melee weapons feel the sameThe game s not worth the money they re asking for being a game with tons of stuff to fix and build upAnd they re trying to make it an esportAt first I thought they were joking but alas they re seriousThey actually think the game is balanced and has enough solid mechanics that aren t 100  based on random numbers to turn this game into an esportThis shows that they clearly don t know what they re doing and they re basically just running down the road with anything that happens to the game Throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks and what notThe mechanics don t even fit the gamemode at all let alone esports For example the gamemode says  go take these guns and be the last man standing  but the mechanics say  camp in a corner and wait for the the 1v1  This doesn t make sense at allI still wouldn t recommend buying just because of the hype or the  millions of sales  numbers that are on the media thanks to  let s be honest youtubers playing it and fans buying it thanks to them Roughly 70  of those sales are Asian cheaters rebuying the game whenever they get bannedDo yourself a favor and play Fortnite Battle Royale instead  this is coming from someone that doesn t like Fortnite either but let s be honest  Fortnite is clearly better on every aspectI ll consider changing the review once it gets better if it ever does,negative
Great game love how much they update the game Gets a little boring when playing by yourself but playing with friends is tons of fun,positive

kind of fun at first but gets old quick You spend 10 minutes gearing up  get the best gear and think you are ready to rock  You get the drop on an enemy shoot him 3 times in the chest only for him to spin around and somehow 1 shot you deadnow that its been released 910 times the game wont even load i get stuck on a black loading screen  this game is a steaming pile o trash avoid it like the plague,negative

The developers introduced microtransactions halfway into Early Access while there are so many bugs in the game still AND they promised not to do that until the game is released ALSO   They stopped delivering Weekly Patches and Patch notes That used to be a way for the community to be a part of the development progress Definitely a bad move,negative

PUBG is a game that I ve played quite a bit of and I ve enjoyed almost all of what I ve played But the problem is almost all of that enjoyment has come from playing with friends Solo this is one of the worst multiplayer games I ve played Weapons  I ve realized after playing for a while that there is really not that much variety in weapons Basically you can use either a shotgun  which are all the same an assault rifle  which are all the same or a sniper rifle  which to be fair actually have variances in feel between the 3 available There are technically also pistols melee weapons smg s and a crossbow but they re all useless Melee is broken pistols do nothing the crossbow is just like a sniper rifle that can t use a good scope and smg s are just worse assault rifles  But  I hear you asking  what if you can t find a good gun then you could use one of those  No If you land in an area with more than 1 house 9 times out of 10 you ll find at least a rifle and a shotgun Speaking of which there isn t really ever a reason to use anything other than 1 shotgun and 1 sniper or if you can t find one an AR Loot  The loot system is more than anything frustrating Most of any given game will turn into looking through houses to find the 1 or 2 pieces of usable loot per house  A gun here some meds there maybe you get lucky and get that elusive level 3 helmet or vest but it s never exciting because you know that by the end of the game your loot s probably going to be the exact same as it always is give or take a few meds that you won t need because you already hgave so many The game just throws loot at you to the point that you will always have everything as long as you don t die within the first 3 or 4 minutes The only real difference from game to game is your scopes To the game s credit scopes can make a huge difference and are relatively rare If you get near the end and you have a x8 scope and the other team only has a x4 you ll have a big advantageCombat Like I said earlier melee combat is completely broken If you land near somebody it will every time turn into both of you jumping around hitting each other hoping that you get lucky and your hits actually register In actual gunfights this is much better but the problem is that if you re only in solos you ll rarely actually have these Most games in solos and many games in duos end with you getting shot from someone you can t see and dying before you can tell where they are Only in squads where you have 3 or preferably 4 pairs of eyes to look will you get into full fledged coordinated fights On the plus side shooting is the one thing in this game that actually feels smooth and responsive Also as much as I m painting a picture of the game being all luck there are still always a decent amount of head on shootouts in most games And when you re in squads the gunplay and fights are as much fun as you ll ever have in a gameGeneral Complaints The game is incredibly clunky Every single thing you do other than shooting feels like it should feel better to do Especially noteworthy are parachuting down jumping driving moving and looting These things happpen to encompass most of the game Which brings me to the core problem of the game  you don t really do anything most of the time This is the biggest reason you need friends to play with for the game to be any good because if you don t the game will just be one big slog where you re running on autopillot until you see another person You drop down look for a gun kill anyone near you once you find one continue looking for scopes and armor and meds go to wherever the zone goes and then repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are less than 10 people left and the zone s small At that point it s a toss up wether you ll have a super fun intense few minutes while you fight to the death or you ll get shot in the back of the head by a sniper rifle and die before you can do anything Overall I d say only buy this game if you have good friends who you are 100  sure you can and will play with for a while,negative

Banning stream sniperhonker has nothing to do with the company so that was the first strike Then already adding box locks with keys at 250 a piece was the second strike Finally the recent announcement that all crates will be locked soon meaning you re literally gonna be running around in your underwear unless you drop money on this game was the third strike Don t touch this game just like many other games before it the fad will pass while the company penny and dimes the whaels that remain,negative

This is a really fun game were you need friends to get the most out of it Alhtough early access and in my opinion needing more content the game would be a good purchase for the price  especially if you have friends who will play it with youPros  Well paced and intense gameplay good game feel  after learning curve styalisticly apealing but graphicly rather average suprisingly solid net code Large player baseCons  repetative if played solo Terible optimization zero tutorials or practice area anoying while learning the game,positive
Despite some flaws most of which  are minor the gameplay is just completely unique and enjoyable My review is solely based on the game external factors put aside This game offers many hours of fun and enjoyment,positive
Sure this game can be a lot of fun If you can get over the bugs crappy home screen UI Latency Inconsistent bullet contacts Bad vehicle physics Unoptimized engine bad net code and obvious ignorance on the developers behalf to try and fix these things before holding an invitational compettition,negative
It s better than the other alternative battle royale games out there looking at you H1Z1 you piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game,positive
I really love this game For one it puts you on edge whether you are alone or with friends the game is always intense It is a scavenging battle royale and honestly it is really good If you are looking for a shooter with a different approach here it is I highly recommend you pick up this game and good luck getting your first win,positive

Having a blast so farbut for long term it needs progression system and more match types which im sure devs will add along the way 25 hrs playedNow having over 300 hours played i dont recommend it as im am facing the issue that i didnt even faced in Early AcessSince the ping based matches were implimentedits been terrible for mei unload a full magazine into but only a few bullets hit em while as i even recieve bullets behind coverGame is funi give it that but being as sucessful as it isone can expect decent online services to go with it,negative

the game is very fun but evrytime i parachute down and im on the floor the building look really messed up and the walls dont even look like they are from this world please can you do something about thus,negative
game is good developer badhonk honk,negative
I didn t think this game was any fun when i first heard of it friends kept on telling me to play it but I didn t really care for it One day i decided to try it just for fun cause money was good and see if it was worth I put in around 20 hours before I even owned the game for a week I think this game has a lot of potential and the current state it is in right now is really good this game can only get better as of now It s only been out for a couple months a year from now this game is going to be way better than what it is now I would recommend this game,positive
I can t put this down  Squad up and last the longest  Have an appetite for chicken because it s for dinner  Great team work game  1010,positive
The concept of this game is fantastic Unfortunately the execution has been so poorly implemented that I can t recommend this game The underlying gameplay mechanics are not well thought out and you notice it everywhere From the first time you parachute in and glitch into a building falling to the ground dying instantly to the lag you experience opening doors and  picking up items it all just feels unpolished This could be a great game but the way it currently plays is unacceptable,negative
If you live in the United States you will basically get to only play this game on weekends These dumbass developers seem to not understand how to implement updates and like to shut the servers down during evening timepeak gaming times for the US  Developers can shove this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game up their fat asses Dont waste your money,negative
Fun game with friends occasionally fun by yourself But with the devs focused on monetising the game rather then fixing hit detection server lag server tick ratepretty much the only things that need to make this game worth while are the only things that the devs arent looking atSo its a no from me510,negative
To start this off this is a fantastic game however with the current state of the game and the horrible actions of the devs time and time again I cannot recommend it This game has horrible servers tons of hackers horrendous optimization the minimum specs are a lie crappy graphics and a community of salty 12 year olds and chinese cheaters If the devs figure out what they are doing this has the potential to be one of the best games on steam,negative
Poor optimized but a very good game Best survival game,positive

Dear developers          This game is amazing and incredibly fun However  I have some issuesI realize this game is in early access but these problems should be taken care of before  vaulting animations  and 15000 tournaments I have a GTX 970 but I rarely get past the loading screens and if I do I ve already been thrown out of the plane with the AFKers and am dying or getting shot If I m lucky enough to even get out of the plane on time then most likely my buildings haven t even loaded and are a meshy pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that I can t interact with Leading me to get killed because I can t loot If by some miracle I do get in with no problems then I have a great time All I m really saying is that you guys need to get your priorities in order as I said with the game in such a broken condition I find it infuriating that you guys are adding more maps and animations and especially throwing thousands of dollar tournaments when the game isn t even close to playable most of the time A game should not take 3 to 6 GIGS of ram EVER I think this game has a ton of potential and everyone else agrees seeing as it s the top game on Steam at the moment But please fix the neccessary stuff before adding more content,positive

Game is good a little overpriced in my opinion Not only because it s bugged as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but also because it doesn t work properly with some hardware I had problem using a very old 160 GB on my rig It wasn t good I admit it but the game just didn t render on time I got to the ground That was really frustrating but when I finally bought my new HDD the game ran smoothly It has a good playstyle and a pretty good game overall I still didn t put a lot of time into it but this is my experience with it so far,positive

Be careful of the purely negative reviews telling you not to buy the game The  microtransactions  they are talking about are going to charity and the winner of a tournament as well as the production of said tournamentSo this uproar is over a voluntary situation where people can choose to spend their money on in game cosmetic items with the proceeds going to charity and a tournament There are legitimate concerns to be sure but that should not warn people from getting into what is clearly the MP Game of the Year for 2017 Cosmetic microtransactions have zero impact on gameplay They should also have no impact on your decision to purchase this game right now 30 for a game I have gotten more out of than any AAA title in years including the Battlefield seriesBTW most people playing at one time over 600000 That was this week Do not listen to these detractors buy the game and get in hereedit  I want to thank all of you who have taken the time out your day to read my post and judge it based on the merit that it is attempting to reveal what has and is actually going on with this recent surge of negativity I will do my best to give an accurate review of this product below based on my experience in the community both as a player   streamer of this amazing gameREVIEW skip to the end for TL DRLike most of you I was hesitant to purchase this game Another Early Access title with some janky looking animations as well as some mixed criticism in the ether of Steam s review system I watched a few streams and bided my time until I felt confident that I was not wasting my money on the chance that it was a good game I have been head long in the dive ever since and don t expect to hit bottom any time soonThe numerous paths to enjoying this game range from simply learning how everything works and dying a lot in that process and I do mean a LOT to being so overcome with adrenaline emotion and exhilaration when you win that you can t control your body The adrenaline dump post win is real and I legitimately wish you feel it every game This game is a rushThere are low points to be sure but they should only be when you find a bug or encounter poor behavior of another player who might be cheating or teaming These behaviors have not been part of my experience at all in over 400 hours of play I can not be certain of the cheating to be sure But because of my perspective they have not impacted my judgement on the game one bit This is just something we as gamers on the PCMR have to deal with so we accept it and move on Be aware PUBG has banned 25k cheaters in the past 3 months It is out there and they are doing their best to fight itLet s get into it Life   Death in the PUBG You will die a lot to things you can not see or hope to control This is not the extent of the game but the stick hitting you to keep moving so you can grab that carrot You will have that carrot Obtaining it is solely based on your actions You decided where to jump from the plane what buildings to loot which items to loot how much you paid attention to the actions of those around you   the circle It was your decision that put you on the exterior of the map when the circle fell on the other side of it You choose to move ahead of the next circle so now you only have to cross part of it in the remaining time you have before it closes again You are the one that did not  slice the pie  in your field of vision to spot the guy sitting by the 3rd tree to your right You are the only one to move you in front of someone else s gun sights Understand this simple principle so you will have a far better time while enjoying the hell out of this gameConsider it in the terms of playing Poker You can learn the game easily enough but it will take you a lifetime to master The only thing you can do is learn from your mistakes Each death is a lesson you can take something away from Don t repeat your mistakes and you can only get better Leave the assumption that your death is based on RNG to the uninformed You are the master of your fate in this game take control of itGunplay Fast hard hitting bullet physics with a semi random pattern of recoil on all weapons makes trigger control   skill a strong factor in determining who wins in the end I suggest you watch MagnumDopus on youtube for a clearer understanding of how weapons   their attachments operate Currently there is no practice range in game other than the starting island with it s selection of weapons on the picnic tables   buildings This may change in the future of course It s easy to fly away from the plane after the drop in order to find a piece of the island to loot   practice recoil controlThey will be adding a new weapon each month Yes they have kept this promise so farVehicles Spawn randomly at predetermined locations across the map with more promised on the way You can use them to extend your drop range from the plane at the start of a game allowing you the freedom to loot in peace in the early game while everyone is fighting   dying Leaving you hopefully well prepared for the mid to late game Or it can be your last gasp at getting in the circle before it slowly kills you You can fly 150 KPH on the 2 seat bike do tricks like an X Games star if you want or ignore them at all costs as they are a loud siren alerting people where to shootFuel isn t an issue if managed well Reasonable durability so they can be destroyed if focus fired by a squad or a m249 Having said all that they are death traps against a good shooter   should be avoided when possible IMOSound  Make sure you are using your basic stereo profile when playing this game 71 surround will distort the location of bullet whizzing   the weapon s report making it almost impossible for you to track   locate the shooterThe ambient audio can be incredibly deceiving at times especially to newer players that may not be used to it 99  of your actions will create an audible que for those around you to take advantage of example One   Two I suggest you pay attention to everything you hear your mind will filter the noise eventually This will allow you to pick up on the changes in your environment   keep

Good game requires good positioning thought and aim However there are many faulty things with this game there is bad hit registration and I don t appreciate the movement of this game not worth the 30 dollars I would buy it if it was on sale but I would just recommend playing fortnite The playestyle of people in the game is terrible by them always camping in corners just waiting for you to run by its not a action packed fun game,negative
Wouldn t recommend the game cause the game has bugs Some rounds you would get stuck in some places thus making you unable to move and literally just die in that spot Sometimes you couldn t shoot your damn weapon as if you have very low internet connection which leaves you defenseless MOStT of the time you can t kill a person cause they already have hacks and know your position all the time like for real,negative

Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is a great game the most fun I ve had in years on a certain game There are a few set backs though  as expected it is an early access game but there are even more pros to getting this gameThe servers at the moment are terrible I gotta be honest with the ones wondering if they re going to buy the game or notIt isn t the best optimized game but has gotten better over the past couple of patchesThe amount of fun you get from playing this game is unreal it can also be really emotional as well The sudden gun fights will put you on edge The adrenaline when you re in the top 10 The happiness when you get greeted with that Winner Winner Chicken Dinner Or the angersadness when you re the one being killed in the last 2 remainingThe graphics are really good for this game but do take a beefy computer to run themOverall this is an amazing game and I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to buy the game and are unsure,positive

extremely fun game kinda addicting lol,positive
Great game Really fun and competitive Haven t experienced any bugs,positive
feels like a waste of time honestly you play through the entire match only to have 30 people crammed into a small play area then once you are still getting situated the circle loses around 800m in size and youre in an area where even IF there was a vehicle you wouldnt use it for logical reasonsyou try to leg out the 800m and die right before making it to the play area and while running to the play area you can see a handfull of other people in the exact same boat as you but they arent shooting at you because there just isnt any time there is alot of fine tuning that needs to be done maybe extend the amount of time between play areas or atleast dramatically reduce the amount of health you lose while   chasing the dragon   Pretty much how every game ends for me really annoying,negative
Its a very good game,positive
This game is really fun and addicting I absolutly recommend this game to anyone thinking on buying it the only downside is that at times the game can be really laggy But other than that this is a really fun game and I recommend it to others,positive
it doesnt work,negative

My experience so far with PUBG is great I m having loads of fun playing with randoms and even more with friends Everybody seems to be complaining about the Chinese swarming the game but to me its not big deal I don t have a big problem with playing with Chinese people because to me a teammate is somebody you need to look after and you need them to look out for you so communication isn t a big issue for me Most of the Chinese players i ve came across have enough understanding of what I tell them and same goes for me understanding them Also many of the Chinese players I came across are good players and will not let you downThe only problem I see with this game is connection issues I haven t experienced much issues at all but i ve seen that many people are Other than the connection issues PUBG is fair game to the player The gunplay is fun and getting kills can be very satisfying I haven t won any games yet but I came very close to winning landing at 2 place with a friend The gear in this game is diverseMy last thing I want to talk about is the hook of this game I played games like Fortnite and H1Z1 before hand Fortnite is not my kind of Battle Royale I want to play and H1Z1 is just pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t I was contemplating whether I should try PUBG or not thinking it was gonna be very similiar but boy was I wrong PUBG was so much fun for me The gameplay is very tactical and I picked up on it quick due to endless fun on ARMA 3 with my brother and friends H1Z1 was mentally painful for me because I couldn t wrap my head around how people get so used to the gunplayPUBG is definitely my favourite coop pvp game currently and I recommend this game to you Give it a shot If you don t enjoy it you can refund it  hoping that you didn t play over 1 hour own it for more than 2 weeks or buy it on a retail key site such as LOVE LOVE LOVE  etcI give this game a mighty thumbs up,positive

This game is really fun to play I ll give it that HOWEVER it is beyond polished compared to the other battle royale games I feel like this game was rushed with muddy textures bad server connection and god awful aiming I like the death cam feature but it s no where accurate on how you died For example every death I ve watched the reticle of the gun is no where near my body and if I m driving or running the enemy s reticle isn t in front of my drivingrunning direction it s behind I understand this game hasn t been out that long but Fortnite has been out almost around the same time and is way beyond more polished when it comes to playability all around and it s free,negative
This Game has been out for a long time I ve been playing from the start the developers don t want to Fix alot of the important issues that the game has  they only carry about the contentThe game is running on the ue4 engine has ugly graphics would think that would help it get more fps but no the fps is really bad my system should run this game everything maxed on ultra and atleast get 90 fps average but I get a cinematic 40 fps when I do that unfortantely,negative
Sick game,positive
CTRL  TFun interesting game but a huge barrier to entry  If you re new you ll need to lookup some guides  There are unique game mechanics in play here that aren t explained and you really don t have time to learn as you go  Since this is Early Access I can t fault the devs for that but they really need a tutorial before official release   even if it s just text or a videoHere s an example of how my first outing went I had no idea what  the circle  was but apparently it was coming  By looking at my map I figured out it was a way to corral players over time so I started heading to the red circle since I was on the opposite side of the island  Once the countdown ended nothing happened  other than me getting shot because I was too worried that the death circle was going to get me  After the match I had to go lookup a tutorial to get all the details,positive
If you play it regularly you will get pretty good at the gamePro  Good Game design Many Updates  crash and bug fixes A leaderboard that actually makes you play against people that are as good as you First and Third Person mode cheaters are very rare high learning curve queues are fastCon  wonky fps  they are working on it  if you have a gtx970 and above you should be able to play this gamewithout any sort of problems random server downtime  server arent down for long though,positive
DIS GAMEA GOOD,positive
theyve done a 180 on their stance about introducing paid items in early accessthen they said they would stop having free items at allthen they said they would wipe peoples earned BPthen they abandoned their schedule of weekly and monthly updatesthen they chose to ban people just because streamers got killedthen they focused on adding more guns rather than fixing basic gameplay flaws,negative
hey i played for like 5 mins and i didnt get a good gun  1010 worth the money,positive
PlayerUnknownBattleGrounds or PUBG was a great game when I began playing Now unless I m playing with friends or just bored out of my mind picking up PUBG is unthinkable I understand that the game is an  early access  game and the team behind this game started out extremely small and is doing what they can But when the devs start breaking promises and implementing cosmetics that the community decided to be pricey  a damn skirt for an online game is over 100 instead of fixing the countless bugs for this game then I say it is safe to say that the headache that this game causes is not worth the current price of 30Now if a friend is telling you to purchase this game so you can play with himher just know what you are getting yourself into That 30 minutes of looting or drivingwalking into the circle can be ruined by one simple bug or camper and when in squads a looting run gets you around 20 50 points with no kills You wont even be able to enjoy the tasteless cosmetics this game has to offer However I ve had plently of good experiences despite what i ve written with this game Those only came when I was with a group of friends not having a care in the world So if you want a game to play with your friends buy something else if they already own this game then why the hell not get rid of the headache you get from them nagging you to get this game and get a new type of headache that being once induced from PUBG,negative
it s a very fun game if you can get over the ear LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at the start of every game,positive
You will not want to meet the Chinese in this gamebecause China number one ,positive
Balancing is terrible needs ranking system update graphics you just became a millionare off of this game and months afterward cant even create a game i want to play,negative
PlayerUnknowns Battleground is the culmination of years and years of passion from the man himself PlayerUnknown A long time staple in the Battle Royale community this man single handedly pushed these types of games into the spotlight What originally started out as a mod for Arma 2 then eventually H1Z1 s KOTK This is the first true standalone battle royale game of this quality and scale Although this ghme isn t perfect its fantastically fun the action packed into this game never ceases to amaze Some of the highlights for this game look like something straight out of a Die hard movie,positive
Why the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i got banned   I did not cheat in this game I was only LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing around a little bit with some guys they reported me I think for harrasement or something like that and BOOM I got banned,negative
I mean as long as you don t get in a game with a crybaby  cough cough  streamers  cough cough  It s really fun,positive

Highly addictive game of survival Some bugs still occur occasionally but what game does not have any  Awesome gameplay,positive
I hate getting teamed up on this game,positive
To start off I really enjoy this game but there are many issues that need fixed I understand that it s still in early access but there s a lot of things like lag problems Sometimes I get rubber banded back which isn t too much of an issue unless you re in a gun fight with another team One out of a few games me and my friends go through  network lag  all at the same time When that happens if you re moving it makes you constantly move without stopping If you re at the edge of the safe zone that could easily cause you to die And as for punching say at the start of a round I could be about 10 meters away and they re able to punch me easily while staying far away from me Some of the driving mechanics need to be fixed as well If you hit even the smallest bump it could send your vehicle into a spiral make you take damage from hitting the small bump or flip your motorcycle over and cause you to fly off taking damage or even killing you Lastly at the start of some rounds none of the buildings loud in and if I try to go inside one I ll either get stuck in a wall that rendered while I was in there or fall through a floor if I try to land on top of a buiding I still love the game but if these issues would get fixed it would be so much more fun,positive
Better than doing blow out of a strippers LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,positive
Right now I am sorry I bought this game the developers said there would be no microtransactions and there are The game is still a buggy mess and they are hosting a tournament The bugs in the game are numerous and game breaking and no one complains those who do have been shouted down by the community The developers are adding in new content where there old content still needs fixing Wait to buy if you buy at all,negative
Very Recommended If You Like Royal Battle Theme Game,positive
Awesome battle royal game solo is boring but duo or squad is the way to go   if you have a friendFast match making for 100 playersDefinitely worth buying,positive
Verry nice,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stupid bluehole,negative
This game started out fresh and new while in early beta However the developers cannot seem to address critical issues of the game such as bugs crashes and just general features that should be there but missing Each update comes with more crashes and issues It seems the developers are only interested in milking the game for money instead of improving the gameplay,negative
Having fun selling crates it s like getting paid to game   I really don t understand why people keep on buying these but just goes to show,positive
Awesome,positive
AWESOME GAME  BETTER THN BATTLEFIELD,positive
Ok so the game itself is ok the network lag is an issue but the biggest issue this game has is it s FULL of hackers especially the chinese this is an issue that needs to be fixed I have been walled so many times it s not funny I have been shot through walls on multiple occasionsSo over all the game is fun when you get a legit game in but unfortunately the hackers are rampant in this game so legit games are rare as for now I can t recommend this game for this reason maybe it ll get sorted then def buy it but I d hold off till then imo,negative
Game is amazingly fun and I rarely have friends to play withHave had literally no problems with optimization or poor fps despite all the complaints I ve been reading in reviews here and my PC isn t amazing by any means As for the microtransactions got some sweet looking items from  em already and can sell extras for a nice profit 250 crate sell jacket drop for 7 Literally don t buy them if you don t enjoy them its not breaking your game plenty of content and fixes are being pushed out regularly alongside the MTX items One thing I would like to see is more map diversity which they are working on if the upcoming desert map is anything to go byThere was also some crap about stream sniping and people being banned for stupid reasons Like honking car horns but I haven t experienced anything like it myself Pretty sad if thats the case but just have to be carefulAll in all awesome game Even better if you have friends to play duo or squad with sometimes,positive
Alright 2 hours in there s no turning back Time for a review bud    brace yourselves Jokes aside I ll just try to describe my experiences in the game and share a little perspective on other reviews so you could decide for yourself whether you want to opt in or outA little background    I m a hardcore DayZ player Or well I m rather newbish in my own ways but hey we aren t here to talk about that The point of this introduction is to note my playstyle and my first experience will back that one upDayZ and other survival games are less dynamic and I would say they re far more strategical than tactical  it all comes down to waiting As such my first round was kind a funny  I found an M16 in one of the first houses and I kept hearing various players around me For a player with my background that s like finding a gold deposit and feeling superior that I hear them moving and shooting while they re denied the same priviledgeWell they eventually   ran off So yeah there goes my experience and that s the first point for PUBG    it s far more fast paced But don t fret    there s plenty of room for patience and the waiting game if that s your thingMy second encounter was actually with exactly that type of a player and it is mere coincidence luck    you name it    that I didn t die right there I walked into an open garage with a door on the other side failing to notice the guy going prone in the rubble on the left side He had the first shot on me but luckily that wasn t a headshot so I made it Panicked blasted the living heck outta him or rather his general area Now what I noted after the fight is how I totally wrecked the door with the combat shotgun  I totally missed and it took pieces off the door    and it didn t feel one bit like a preset damage status it actually looked like the bits were missing right where I shot    the bottom leftSo that s another point for the game    you can destroy things and even though it s no Arma in ballistics the guns actually operate like guns at least that s my perspective so far You fire at an object they can destroy    they will destroy it One of the better ways of clearing a small building is blasting the heck out of the door if you re positive there s someone in thereBottom line so far it s a thrill really   Now onto the cons the game s streamer issue dev decisions on the financial model and roadmap have stirred up quite some attentionCan t say I support the devs for how they handled the problem with the streamer  in short  guy kills streamer streamer complains guy gets banned  details unknown From my experience  I ve got some there s always a bit of dirt on every party and there s always two sides to a story Devs did fail to handle it properly given the attention this case s generated so far though I can t say it s something to put them on the wrong side of the airlock for I d love to see their statement on the matter but then again I haven t been most proactive in trying to find an explanation from their sideCrates and keys duh it s no surprise that wasn t much welcomed by the community No one likes their gaming life planned out for them but then again it s something that keeps players hooked keeps items rare and keeps the game development going So my two cents    I ll be taking it as long as they don t get extreme with itAnd while some reviews I ve come across point out that the developers  claim about  cosmetic only  items is invalid given the game takes camouflage seriously    it can be the deciding factor to whether you live or die    you can always find the gear in the game that looks concealing enough Admittedly it s unlikely you ll come across a ghillie easily  I ve never found it yet but it s not like you can t live without it Oh and keep in mind  the beginning of the game is quite intense and you never really get much cover no matter what You ve got everybody parachuting down and if you re attentive enough you can note everyone s directions and approximate landings and pan it out on your  map  as to whether they re likely to goThe ultimate argument to the above is I just use the default character  afro american with dark beige pants and I ve been doing fine in terms of coverTurned out a messy review but hey you can check out the curators for some professional insight on a game I m just giving a human perspective here   ,positive
Runs so horribly it s unplayable Uses up all of the RAM on my PC causing all of my programs to crash I have 16GB of RAM That should not be happening or be even near remotely possible Constantly crashes freezes and stutters Developers thought it d be a great idea to add microtransactions and new ingame items worth real money instead of making the game not require 20GB of RAM,negative
Broken promises added transactions questionable staff choice unfair bans slow development What a mess which is a shame because the core game is good,negative

This is by far the best game i have gotten this year I have played h1z1 in the past and compared to that it is 10 times better PUBG makes you feel more into the game unlike h1 It is strategic and extremely fun to play with friends Would recommend to anyone out there who is looking for a good mix between MMO and FPS,positive

One of the best games I have ever played There are very few hardcore shooters out there but this one fills the niche perfectlyThey absolutely need to work on optimization though I have a 980 and a strong processor  for 2016 and I still have performance issues,positive
so far very intenceThe Game Admins have reduced the weapon spawns Ouch I think they need to be increased To many Games that i m now in and your I find myself still looking for weapons or scopes at the end of the match,positive
The best game currently out there at the moment No two games are the same and no matter how you die it just entices  you back in knowing what you did wrong the last time and vowing to correct it next timebut of course there are new mistakes to make,positive
Would highly recommend this beautifully developed game If anyone in H1Z1 KOTK said PUBG is a terrible game and don t get it DON T LISTEN TO THEM I was an H1Z1 player myself but I decided at the current state of H1Z1 KOTK the new update that looks gross  basically a PUBG clone update and the ban on chinese streamers which made the OP SKINS market for H1Z1 crash BIG TIME That all made me decide to sell my skins on OP Skins and use my OP Skins money to buy this game Let me tell you IT WAS WORTH IT This game is x10 better than H1Z1 KOTK in my opinion I HIGHLY recommend this game to H1Z1 players that are getting tired of the same old or want to do the same thing as I did because of the update coming soon and the maret crash Or for cs go and experienced game players who love warfare games IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE PC GAMING COMMUNITY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PRACTICING A BIT OF H1Z1 KOTK and CS GO first This game is just a beautiful battle royal warfare Hope I made up your mind on trying out this game  IT S WORTH IT,positive
Worth the money if you have  a friend s to play it with and a decent computer  at least a GTX 670 or equivalent,positive
Game Devs banning anyone who upsets their precious streamers game banning people for friendly fire continued crap optimization that causes fps spikes on even high end rigs have turned an amazing game to a mediocre one Once the devs pull their head out of their  and match policies for streamers to those of literally everyone else and put more time into polishing the game then the game will truly shine,negative
Great game at a great price,positive
With version 10 the polish I needed to see is finally here this game is now fun and playable,positive
This game is in my top 10 favorite games of all time and there is so much to name that I like about the game but in this temporary review im going to include a few of my criticisms for the game  Sound options are lacking especially in terms of the voice chat  Server power is impressive but somewhat lacks in certain spots  Vehicle physics can be very broken in situations such as car collisions especially with other vehicles  Parachutes can get caught on buildings and temporarily suspend players in the air  Pressing F to pick up items feels too slow and sometimes glitches out  Surround sound is broken it sometimes makes it very hard to detect the location of a car and gunshots especially if they re coming from behind your location  Object penetration is wonky and doesn t make sense in certain casesThis game is still fantastic I reccommend it 100 ,positive
yes good games nice players and good shoot nice,positive
Its like hunger games  D1010Will get frying pan again ,positive

PUBG certainly has a lot of issues PLAYERUNKOWN hasn t done a good job of handling the public image for the game and has questionable ideas about what a player can be banned for  ie stream sniping The game is also rather poorly optimized there are lots of bugs servers go down often crashes happen every once in a while there s somewhat of a low variety of weapons etc However I would be lying if I said this game wasn t extremely fun The game is just so fun that despite the issues I find myself playing it and enjoying it every time,positive

Probably the best fast paced multiplayer experience available right now It has issues Hackers optimization network issues  which are much rarer than they were etc But it s fun So I guess that s the most important thing Also shoutout to the devs for keeping it 30 even though it s out of early access  something the devs of Ark couldn t seem to do for whatever reason Also China numba 1 Don t region lock,positive

After hearing people rave about this game I caved in and bought it just to come it a realization that it was over hyped garbage I returned it after bout 2 game as it runs terrible even in high end rigs with massive fps dip as high as 40 50 fps at a time The sad part is I would recommend no man s sky over this game after the latest update don t waste you money and time it s a sorry excuse for a shooter,negative

Cons  I wanted to enjoy this game trust me I really did but most of my time was not battling was not trying to snipe someone from a far it was walkingThe map just felt too big and at least the guns I used felt the same When you die it did not feel like you derseved it it felt like you well skipped 10 minutes of your lifePros  I do understand how people may enjoy the game seeing how sometimes it can feel cool running around in a giant battlefield not knowing where anyone is If thats sounds good to you then play it just do not expect to be finding people that ofen,negative
Game with a casual yet competitive game with highly interesting gameplay and is very varied when it comes to gameplay Highly recommended,positive

i suck at this game,positive
My god this game is a nightmare When I join a game I have a 80  chance that it just never renders the buildings Its thinks I am a million miles away from this building This has caused over 4 hours of me just trying over and over and over just to get a game that doesnt  crash  by freezing for hours on end Thats the worst part instead of crashing its acting like it still is playable but nope you wait for 20 minutes and nothing changes once it freezes Its a great game and I know it is early access but a rendering glitch this major where the buildings are just blobs should have never made it to an early access state thats more like pre pre alpha,negative
A game i can see exiting the early acces hell pubg expecially with the new hardore mode is an must buy for any battle royale type of game fan prepare to be astouned by the system requirments though  random performance issues and crashes I hope they ca fix these problems before a real launch,positive
Some of the players that  get top 10 are campers I ve done it too Tried and successfully reached top places without firing a single bullet either crawling in grass or sitting in a building in First Person That to me doesn t feel righta change is needed not sure what Another annoying thing that brings nothing to the game is the red zone why not remove it  And recently the server crashes and lag has been off the chart Still for a early access it is a fun game to play with a friend maybe not solo Recently edited review,negative
Its a really Funny Realistic and Competitive game i do recommend it,positive
Just shy of 1000 Hours played on this game and I ve decided I am done its apparent that the developers do not care about the pressing issues in this game the hot issue for a majority of the player base is the hacking issues the hours apon hours of proof provided for how blatant the hacker problem is and yet the original hacks that people have been using since day one still 100  function on this game unobstructedOut of 970 Hours I ve played I have encountered blatant hackers every second game on my local Oceanic serversThere are community members out there who have reverse engineered the hacks to find out how they work with PUBG and yet the Devs have not And yet the community manager is asking people to revoke content creators videos that showcase the hacker problem cause it publicly displays how apparent the issue is instead of fixing the problem they are too focused on trying to hide the issue and sweeping it under the rugThe game was rushed to production with 10 being a incomplete game riddled issues the idea and foundation of the game is strong but it covered in horse LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the team who developed this game are not devs they are hackers themselves the game is built off foundations of other games they hack code from other sources to peice together there LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  which explains how they have no idea how to fix this problem I ve uninstalled this game was worth my money cause of the hours I ve put into the game but if you are willing to put hours apon hours apon hours into a game to get 1 golden game where you can enjoy the content with a friend then its worth it for you otherwise turn yourself around and go get something you can get better value for money like a ball in a cup,negative

I just got this game and have about 10 hours when this review is being written and honestly very fun game but there is room for improvement One thing that I will say off the bat if you re reading around the time I post this is that the optimization of this game is absolute trash My computer can run GTA 5 with medium settings at around 60 fps but this game is quite the killer You will have to tweak a lot and manage with trash settings to get 70 fps on very low settings That should be expected though since it is in early access but like king of the kill it will most likely stay this way for a while The gameplay is super fun and the bugs add personality but somethings you should be aware that the map is very large so there will always be something wrong I was playing earlier and fell through the world on one of the beaches and it s quite frustrating but killing in this game is extremely rewarding If you like games that are quite immersive and challenging this is perfect for you You really feel like you re in this battle royale simulation and I often find myself red faced from intensity Personally this game is worth it pretty cheap compared to triple A titles but you get what you pay for Thanks enjoy Hopefully this helps Also the game is kinda based off chance because you choose where to spawn by jumping out of the beginning airplane but sometimes the area that you need to head to can be on the complete opposite of the map sometimes extremely out of range Even if you are the best player in the world you will NOT win all of your games I ve won sometimes and next game would get 70th place,positive
fps is terrible if you have under a 960 gtx 4 gb good luck playing,negative
best game ever thanks for creating such a game,positive
Coming from COD and CS background  I find this game very entertaining and fun  If you are playing for fun and thrills and some sense of adventure trust me this game worth your money  This game is still developing and in the process of evolution but yet it has a great community  not toxic as COD and CSGO and definitely no  less hackers than previously mentioned cancers we call games ,positive

I portray monotonous melancholy in announcing that since the very moment my estimable Johndavid and Johndave departed to visit hydrological spectacles of much velocity and turbulence in distant lands my feeble and tattered soul has been vigorously seized in my mortal compendium s clutches who by using its skeletal injury to justify its dubious deeds swears to proceed to exploit me as long as I am in a plight of emotional deterioration As such Johndavid has interdicted me from embodying the spirit of anything but one of a trifling and irreclaimable existence,positive

1010 emotional experienceI went into solos and the game started out normally I was far outside the first circle and needed a car to make it there I found a UAZ in a short while and began driving down the road towards the circle I soon ran into another player in another UAZ I immediately rammed him after which he offered an allegiance I accepted and we unleashed our inner Mad Max our first fight as blood brothers he flipped a smaller car off the road after which I ran over it s occupant After that we shared other battles took more lives under our wheels until one fateful encounter We were driving along a road when from the bushes beside us came enemy gunfire i pulled back around and ran over the assailant but when i drove up to my ally s car i found him dead on the ground I crouched over his body in grief and fired my bullets up through the rain towards the gods that so unjustly took his life I will never forget you bloodbrother never,positive

In its current state PUBG is unplayable In 45 games the textures don t even load on medium graphics and I m dead in 30 seconds because I fall through floors can t find items  since they don t appear etc My rig is good enough to run the majority of Steam games on highultra graphics but this game is soooo poorly optimized that even the lobby doesn t load correctly I would understand if this game was still in Alpha or earlier stages but right now this game is a source of frustration and a waste of timeWhen it works it s fun But it rarely does Don t waste your money until the developers can create a stabile functioning client,negative
This is game is awesome it has so much stuff to do and really entertaining i would recommend you guys to join it might still be in early access and bugs but still is a Fun LOVE LOVE LOVE  game,positive
very addictive and frustrating at the same time well worth wasting my money on this 4 sure,positive
Queing up with randoms is hit or miss as there s no incentive to not   play like garbage by going school etc every round and dieing 2 minutes in  disconnect   be a crappy team matenot want to winYou don t win much for actually winning or kills etc which incentivizes the micro transactions   which is really lame I can see why that annoys people so much it really makes the game feel cheap  When a reputable developer does this game style proper nobody will play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game again until then yeah I guess I reccomend it maybe I guess35 microtransacted team mate disconnect chicken dinners,positive

PUBG is a game that s worth the money but needs a lot of work Currently it s optimized like a crappy indie game yet it has many desirable elements of other AAA titles If you like firstthird person shooters and survival games give it a go Who knows  Maybe the game s brand new competitive scene will pay off for some of the players grinding every day,positive
Its Gud,positive
Great game heaps of fun,positive
I have wasted lots of time on this game that should have been spent on my education,positive
Pros  Balanced weapons   Every gun feels strong for what its worth even the pistols Gameplay   Gameplay feels rewarding whether its getting kills finding loot or just surviving it feels pretty cool SquadDuos   Because of the nature of the game squad and duo queues are a lot more fun than in gmaes such as H1Z1  In my personal opinion Theres a lot more teamwork involved in encounters and if you get caught out on your own you re screwed Variety   There are loads of different weapons and mods at your disposal Whether you choose to be a stealthy sniper or rambo is up to youCons  Servers   Spawing in is horrific I ve noticed it more in solos but during landing  another con and the first few minutes people will teleport around and you will occasionally rubber band After a few minutes its alright Landing   Jumping out of the plane   fine Flying down   fine Actually landing with the parachute   Painful infuriating and slow If you re not over flat ground be prepared to decend at around 1 nanometre a second and if you land on a wall or in between a narrow space be prepared to hang there for around a minute spamming F to cut your parachute but it wont let you Perfomance   Not really a con more of a warning but I run the game at around 40fps with a 960 with everything on low You ll need a beefy card to run the game wellPS  Buy the game its great Once the server issues are fixed I wont see much wrong with the game For an early access game this is one that I would say is worth buying,positive
trash game everyone is toxic and after u have a little bit of knowlage of the game they put u with pros its a 00000000001111  chance of u getting close to winning honestly buy a different game,negative
I bought it I loaded it I clicked on  Rules of conduct  I uninstalled it and finally I requested a refund While the majority of the rules are fine there are a few that are honestly ridiculous Plus i ve heard too many horror stories of this games moderators in regards to these rules  Do not use extremely foul language including but not limited to excessive profanity or language that is graphically sexual grotesque or violent  It s the Internet pal GET LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING USED TO IT Do not impersonate other individuals  This is pretty vauge cannot I not go on there and claim  I m Morgan Freeman   Do not team kill  there is no excuse for non accidental team kills If your teammate is breaking these rules report them to us instead  HEY PLAYERUNKNOWN IVE GOT NEWS FOR YOU Have you ever thought of turning friendly fire OFF    Whatever the case whether it be an accident or not a troll could use this to get the  accidental    team killer banned Do not team  teaming is defined as two or more players in the same match working together in a larger group than is intended for the selected game mode  This is what gets me the most why can I not team  There are many different play styles and this is just limiting those styles I get where PlayerUnknown is coming from he doesnt want a big group of people picking off individuals Honestly though how likely is this to happen in the first place   Do not stream snipe  this is a form of cheating and you will be banned if you do it  Basically if I stream I can get people banned for killing me   o I ll truely be feared amongst the PUBG communityThis game looks fun but with those set of rules I cant play this,negative
Love this game can t get enough of it,positive
Still the best battle royale game for me,positive

It s ok Not as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  as H1z1 Still wouldn t pay more than 15 for it though,positive
Honestly great game by far the best royale type shooter out there right now some of the complaints are stupid do i think the developers should focus on bugs    yes however adding content is a great way to keep the less hardcore  majority of the players player base happy also on the topic of micro transactions it really isnt a big deal considering all the crates are cosmetic only and to be frank the more colorful and outlandish cosmetics people put on the more visible they are to other players in game,positive
Please add NIGHT,positive
Great gameGood price,positive

Best money I ve spent since BF4 back in my console days As of this review I m just shy of 300hrs which equates to  012 per hour of playtime And I ve no intention of stopping now Sure it can be clunky but the replay value is insane as I can just pop back into another game the minute I die It s also helped with my cardio as once I make it to Top 10 my heart racesAs for the complaints about bugs the reality is that it is a EA game We re essentially paying to be beta testers But I ve played much worse games that were considered  full release  Well worth your money in my opinion,positive
sooo I tried to run over some guys with now weapons and after a lot of trying with my orange dacia i gave up so i stop my car the two guys get inside one of them was a lady and the other one a guy so we drive to the circle on a longest road trip ever would be uber agai 1010,positive
This game is the best battle royale game I ve ever played But it s not fun for me that much From more than 10 games I enjoyed only 2 Why   Because the game behaves like I don t have good enough PC for it But I more than pass the minimal requirements When I join it I either dont  see any buildings or they look terrible and I can t access them Someone goes to the building before my 3 to 5 minutes of loading them and then kills me Sometimes it freezes and I have to restart the game That s why most of the time I don t enjoy it,negative
The game itself is fun pure fun but the sheer amount of graphical issues freezes and crashes sour the experience I m sticking with it but I would recommend waiting until it s further optimised,negative
GGWP,positive
Great game  ,positive
there s a lot of people that are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off about the micro transactions that have been included into the game I have to say that I strongly dissagree with their ideasFirst off the micro transactions that have been added do NOT hinder the gameplay maybe a few pieces of clothing might make it SLIGHTLY easier to hide inn certain areas but it s all simply cosmetic and you don t HAVE to pay a single penny for anything in the game if there s clothing you don t like  sell it on the marketplace you can make up whatever a key is worth and open one of the special crates but not ALL crates require a key to open just the oneIn my opinion this game is a great  Fight for Life  game an  Arma for noobs  or a great way to challenge yourselfthe game is worth every penny and it always will be On top of everything the game is updated bi weekly and the updates have been great so farOnly a few things should be added to the game but they don t really hinder gameplay muchThings like a Vehicle repair kit so that if your tires get shot out in a gun fight you can save the car and still use it and maybe another reward for when you win a game,positive
It s an overpriced broken alpha in which these greedy grabblers are already implenting micro transactions as if they didn t make enough money already with 7 million sold copies,negative
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t game i played 10 games in a row and couldn t find a weapon but the in the next building found 10 wepons and and all utility a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and of course if buy some miricle i find a wapon the guy cant be motherLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hit 1010 would die again,positive
This game is full of hackers and developers do nothing about this,negative
hey,positive
It need work on lag and others,negative
Terrible optimized game lag and desync issues very low thick rate and bad hit detection Otherwise great idea and game but unplayable at momentsTo be edited if works properly on release,negative
Easily one of the worst games i have ever played Its full of hackers and bugs that shouldnt exist in this time and age PlayerUnknown and whoever else manages this game are doing a very terrible job  they act like nazis and lie to the community also have become very lazy,negative
Great gameplay with great graphics added to it If you have a powerful PC buy this But if you dont be prepared of crashes and low fps Great game but damn Thos crashes I have a GTX1060 but I still experience a lot of crashes I wont give a thumbs down even though crashes gives me headache because the game is really great Although it would be amazing if only this game was stable,positive
33 hours in and it s still an enjoyable experience Sure there are issues but nothing that ll haunt you If you enjoy games that can go from 0 to 100 in a split second this is great for you,positive
seems legit,positive
Its a really good game but you guys should fix a lot of bugs that the game has,positive
This game will be perfect once it s completely optimized However the FPS mode should have a seperate FOV slider from the main 3rd person view,positive
I just purchased this and i have to say  i havent played a game this intense for a long time Buggy  Yes Poor Performance even on low  Yes BUT its worth itIt is so fun and frustrating in the begining that you cant stop playing910 worth it,positive
I got my money back from selling crates but this game has soo many hackers its stupid Please region lock this,negative

Great fun Refreshing take on shooters  looks really good Definitely goty 2017 for me,positive
People are children and complain about anythingMicro transactions are completely voluntary you may take no part if you wishBut humans are driven by greed so some see this little pixel skirt in a crate they really really want but realize they have to pay for so they complain and say this game is not worth buyingLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing children manTop game recommend 10 times over,positive
Best game that has been in EA since arma 2 dayz that came 5 years ago It is still in EA so ofcourse it has poor optimization and bugsThe main difference with dayz and pubg is that the developers of pubg is doing many unpopular choises that effect them negative short term for the ability to enforce a set of rules The rules are put in to make sure that everyone gets a fair chance without people getting advantages or other people getting TKI cant understand why people complain about that you get banned for TK random players on your squad You checked the box for automatching then you have to behave If someone TK someone in your group then just make sure everyone has proof of the tk and report him I have played many hours and maybe 100 hours in automatching without ever gotten TK So the chance of it happening is close to 0  and therefor a non issueAnd people who complain about streamsniping should find better things to do The chance for getting banned for killing someone ingame or honking with the car at a random spot ingame is so low that if you feel that it is a great chance then you should play the lottery Streamsniping is a serious issue for streamers and ofcourse they can take part of the blame themself for not putting delays which will cost them  alot of money Since PUBG is a game developed by a company then ofcourse they will protect people who live from streaming and make sure that many new players buy the gameBug exploiting is no point in discussing Look at arma 2 dayz As soon as there was means of duping items etc the game broke Soon after everyone got the best weapons and gear and it needed to be modded further to hold onto many of the players And finally the paid crate As soon as I heard it I got really angry and felt that they had betrayed me But after a couple of really good patches with content increase in performance and decrease in desync it got better And after I got to sell the crates and earn enough money so that the game was free for me then it was a non issue It is obvious that the paid crates didnt take resources from the main team to develope and therefor it is ok1010 game and with the continued good job that the devs do with this game it will be one of the best games ever released when it gets released in Q4,positive
BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED,positive
naise game,positive
this is probably one of the worst games that I have ever made They just want money now thats why they added in game cosmetics which you have to buy a key to open a crate which they said they would release after early access and clearly they don t keep their promises Basically the better computer you have the better you will be because you won t get any fps drop which I get suddenly espically in a gun fight Sometimes I don t get the fps drop but now I do Also if you don t play on very low for your graphic settings then you have a major disadvantage as people on very low settings have a big advantage when in grass as the grass isn t visible to them on their screen and people on high can t see them cuz their grass is covering this view When I play I use very low settings and can see anybody whos in grass clearly because on my screen the grass isn t actually visable Also I have the worst luck in the game idk if its luck or the game just hates me because whenever I land i always land last and if i do land early I always end up in a house without any guns so i just die immediately making the game not fun And also whenthe pick up animation occurs but I dont even pick anything up and someone else does and kills me with the gun Stop adding these cosmetic items and actually fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game because if you don t u will start to see a lot more negative reviews This game is just going to turn into like H1Z1 where there are hackers and bugs that are everywhere The creators are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and should just retire because they are doing a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  job at fixing pick up bugs Also apparently a point blank shotgun shot doesnt kill someone like wtfUpdate After 10 release I shoot a guy with no vest with a Scar L and he doesn t dieI would high recommend not to buy this game as its basically H1Z1,negative

What a spicy chicken gameAnti plug in system is simply air Plug in so many lock head perspective from the invincible And the blue hole isn t being cleaned  We Chinese may be just a hanging player in your eyes but have you considered our not hanging Chinese players  We re banned for no reason Asian clothing list top ten almost all plug in why not regulation I don t understand I hope that the blue hole can give us these ordinary players an explanation do not let us feel that everyone is against all of us in China we also hate hanging players we are also hanging for the opening of the team mates directly killed we also hate plug in But why are we blocked so many accounts ,negative

game is great bummed that they added microtransactions but im not going to complain and negative review a great game for such a little problem like that all in all a great game and i recommend it to anyone wanting to play a good battle royal game,positive
Wait until the full release Right now you re buying a really fun game that s plagued with annoying bugs that ll shorten your life by years,negative

Awesome game to play with friends very tactical when you go for wins especially in 1st person Game mechanics feel responsive and game is now at a point where it feels pretty well optimised so all in all it feels pretty fluid I would recommend this game,positive
Great game highly recommend lots of fun with friends and random people too,positive
One of the best games I have played I have had it for a while now but haden t really been getting into it It s really boring  in my opinion when you play by yourself but when you get a squad going HOLY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Granted it does have it s issues including graphic optimization but I can overlook these due to the fact it s in early access Would 100  spend 30 for this Hell I d probably spend 60 if they made it that high,positive
So they can add first person only but they still dont fix the fact i die early every time because my textures never load and i get killed from a house i cant even see or get into,negative
overly buggy terrible starting system just leads to a lot of wasted time of repeated matches of dying before even getting a chance to play the actual game,negative
With 300 hours the game WAS amazing Following the recent update completely changes the pace of the game quite clearly trying to copy fornite with there sucess Does not suit the play style of the game Way to fast paced having to take cars everywhere you go brings me back to the h1z1 days but only it does not go well with PUBG They have ruined the game also rigged with hackers The maps are way to big to have the game so fast paced If they actually release this new  4x4  it might suit the new update but for the meantime this game is going to sit in my libraryWAS 1010NOW 210PLEASE BRING BACK PUBG,negative
This was a fun game at first because it was a new idea so i put a little bit of time into the game Now the game is just garbage It is just an unoptimized shooter were you shot the person five times but in the game you may have it him once The company really should have finshed the game before making a console and mobile version but there are just all about the money They rather just pump out the game and make as much money as they can before actually making a decent working game I am just here to save you the money and time on this game If i had the choice I would have never bought the game,negative
I saw people play it and it looked really fun I saved 40 dollars for this game only to get one of the worst games I ve ever played it s so boring and disapointed I ve only played it once that is how bad it is,negative
Well here we go This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Seriously i cant find anything good about this game besides the gun sounds because they sound nice The game looks like complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  which i dont really care about but i know others do The game is 100  LUCK I know that a battle royale game is going to have an element of luck that is obvious but this game is so luck based that it is just flat out gambling every time you jump out of that plane Searching the houses around the map which is the main way to get gear is stupidly frustrating because you never find LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you have to luck out to even find an Assualt rifle with and sometimes you wont even find LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ammo for it The games shooting mechanics are alright at best nothing special The games movement is clunky as hell you get stuck on doorways and staircases all the time leading to me wanting to punch a hole through my monitor The maps are also awful they are so big and empty there is literally nothing in the maps besides hills and trees and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  then a couple buildings The only way to get high power weapons which are op as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  are in crates that drop from the sky but good luck getting into them The drops come out of nowhere and you have to luck out because players who got there first will pull out their m249 as soon as you get over the hill that the crate dropped on I love turning a corner with maybe an ak  with half a mag and a level two vest just to see some dude turn around with a maxed out 416 with full lvl 3 armor as my heart just stops and i have to accept i died because that player happened to get a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  load of gear while i didnt Or maybe you have the full on lvl 3 gear with a maxed out kar 98 and ar but some dude is hiding in a bush with his dinky little smg because he happened to get there before you People tend to get banned because they just killed a streamer and apparently any streamer that gets killed is by stream sniping every single time it was never their fault it was always player unknowns precious streamers Ridicoulous The games director who for some reason has to put his LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing name in the title of the game is a complete clown He wont region lock china which is where hackers FLOOD the NA servers because apprently its  racist  i mean what  And dont get me started on the optimization you all know its garbage and the game runs like a god damn toddler programmed it Overall ive put 130 hrs into this game because i wanted to like it so bad but the game is just awful Like i said i understand that battle royale is going to have an element of luck to it and thats fine but this game is PURE luck no skill at all and that is just completely awfulThe optimization and the director being a clown and not region locking china just is the icing on top This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and a waste of money If you want to play br go play fortnite that game is trash too but at least its free and optimized,negative
Playerunknown s battlegrounds eh  The grounds for the battles of the players that are unknownToo much lag fix it ffsBuy it if you can handle the lag and bugs,negative
Great concept feels like Arma or Argo  for obvious reasonsThe devs have also put in a good amount of work updating their game with ne content and bug fixesHowever i cannot suggest this game at this stage it needs to be fixed Found a nice building to scout the surrounding area from  Better pray to god someone is not encountering a bug that allows them to either walk through or see through buildings Also expect the game to crash on an almost daily basis due to memory leaksOnce these problems have been permanantly fixed i will go ahead and update this reviewEdit   We no longer crash on the daily,negative

Overall love this game It s part of the reason I got into PC gaming in the first place It has a few bugs here and there which is to be expected with a game still in development but overall I m a huge fan,positive
The game is absolutely unforgiving to new players If you don t wish to dedicate hundreds of hours into a game and instead want a more casual experience PUBG is not for you I can however see the appeal for high level play Nevertheless at my level unless I have a group of friends PUBG is very hard to enjoy,negative

It s a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  RNG based gameStay awayThere s a reason this has a  mixed  reviewEdit  Also  a complete waste of time Get ready to loot for 20 minutes spend 20 minutes in mid game doing nothing only to get randomly shot out of nowhere Stay away just get fornite,negative
This game seems very difficult confusing and even anger inducing at first But if you stay with the gamea for a while it becomes very fun and addicting I highly reccomend this game,positive
This game is good i recommend this,positive
Please consider fixing the texture loading issue as it makes the game unplayable and it frustrates many people whohave the problem and i would appreciate if this issue willbe no more in the next update otherwise i will want a refund,positive
This game Is absolutely mindblowing for its huge success surpassing the 1 spot of the most saled non steam game and it has totally earned it Even though Its still an alpha I can t get the most out of it running low and very low on 1920 x 1080 resolution with my GTX 960 and quite often getting drops under 60 fps There is a glitch where the buildings won t load as soon as I land but I believe its just a RAM problem  currently at 8GB  Gameplay wise I think its the best game in its category and definitely better than its competition made by great devs listening to the community and taking care of the game I d say this game is a must if you like survivalfps games,positive
Pros   Great concept Great gameplayCons  Players who play on the lowest graphical setting have a massive advantage Microtransactions after being told there would be none Probably one of the worst optimised games I have ever played,negative
Core gameplay is fun but does not have much content for it s priced point and it s heavily RNG based when key areas should have better  loot then other places which would attract more players to it which would make these high risk high reward areas Right now all loot is kinda just scattered around the map at random Game also has microtransactions which is garbage and the devs are probably gonna abandon the PC platform when console comes out to develop that to reel more sales on console before abandoning the game as a whole Such is the way of life for popular early access gamesContent like custom matches and private servers is also locked off for certain streamers which is total garbage Playing with friends and communicating over a mic is hella fun tho When the bugs don t screw you over and ruin everything,negative
there is such a low skill cap in this godforsaken game the only factor is luck,negative

It s developed by a small and quite new company and this is the first game they made and it literally blew up  most PCs as well I see a lot of potential in the game and the devs are doing the right things but it s going at a pace the community isn t used to I appreciate the work and the time that went into this game and I m sure this will eventually satisfy everyone s needs,positive

Fun but not that fun This is one of those games where you play for a few days and then just gets boring becuase it ends up being the same old same old The only people who play for months are people who are extremely good or you have friends who play that are good Just go play it at a friends house,negative
Pros and cons but overall it is a good game to play,positive
I haven t played that much yet but here s a review for if you re deciding to buy it or notUpsides   Hours of fun gameplay either solo or with squadduo  Automatch possible   Big map lots of places to find loot and enough places to hide  Not a lot of microtransactions they re only for clothes right now lol  Fairly simple keybinds for gameplay and vehicles  cars motorcycles  Instant matchmaking  Very fun to play with friends  Rewards in crates which you can sell on the market  Currently for about 1Downsides   Movementcliming can be confusing  Graphic issues such as buildings not rendering I have to turn textures to ultra and the rest to low in order for stuff to render before I land  60fps overall  Optimization isn t great  Seems boring at first takes time to get used to  You will die a lot  Apperently Developers are banning for exploits and stream sniping which is unfair for an early access game  Looting takes most of the time  Hit Detection isn t perfect,positive
fk yeah,positive
I really wanted to get into this game but after spending 16 hours I was left with very conflicting opinions Before I begin I want to assure everyone I am trying to avoid completely bashing down this game as I am aware it is still an early access game and I know the game is subject to change At this time however I cannot recommend it at this stage in development until I see some much needed changesTo begin I ll weigh in on my opinions about the game and underlie particular pros and cons What made this game enjoyable for me and what makes it very disappointing and even unplayable I ll start with the cons as this is a negative reviewCONS  TERRIBLE PHYSICS  Vaulting is coming soon to compensate for the bad physics but jumping may still be awkward after the change  EVERYONE IS A BULLET SPONGE  Players often absorb 6 shots to the body before they are killed while headshots are an instant kill Seems fair enough but there is a bigger issue that needs to be addressed due to the reward which I ll mention later  ACCURACY GOES OUT THE WINDOW WHILE STRAFING  While in 3rd person the character their weapon and the reticle all remain static while strafing but weapon spray becomes astronomically unrealistically god awful while moving rendering you a useless shot Will also mention later  INSTANT DEATH AFTER EXITING VEHICLES even when it s only going 5 mph   GAME IS NOT OPTIMIZED  BLOCKY UNTEXTURED BUILDINGS AFTER LANDING  Doesn t happen to everyone but plagues a lot of players Also they cannot be entered until they load which leaves you out in the open       PROS  FPS   BATTLE ROYALE GAMEPLAY  MAP LAYOUT IS BALANCED  VERY EXHILIRATING GAMEPLAY  The action is there It s very heart pounding exciting and sometimes terrifying  RNG  Can be frustrating at times but every now and then you stumble across some lvl 3 gear immediately upon landing Also it s a rush to loot everything before all the other playersAs far as the headshot mechanic goes for being as brutal and rewarding as it is gives a huge advantage over other players that aim for the torso Weapon accuracy is nearly 100  while standing still and something like 25   while strafing  obviously not fact checked but feels close to it so when I try to avoid enemy fire by walking sideways I cannot aim at all and miss most if not all of my shots and the other player usually wins the encounter If I stand still to fire accurately I become a silly pencil stick baiting for an easy headshot At the end of the day this game leans heavily towards rewarding headshots clearly way more than realistically aiming for the torso This is my biggest gripeTo wrap it all up I have a long history of playing FPS games like Battlefield Call of Duty Black Ops and even Delta Force  very nostalgic game for me and when I play PUBG and am forced to abandon old habits like moving while gunning and shooting a sponge and not dying the game becomes very discouraging to play I really want to see some more improvements in the following areas listed above In the mean time I ll sit on this one for a while and keep checking back to see if any of these changes make its way into the woodworks so I can recommend this game,negative
Love this game,positive

Fix your game My keyboard is azerty and only when I play this game it goes to Qwerty  because of this i lost many games  suddenly I start autowalking proning or switching guns so again  FIX THE GAME,positive
This game ran great for me before the last update with an occasional crash every now and again after about an hour of gameplay I was fine with that being that it s an early access game and is to be expected However since the last update something must ve changed that drastically altered my pc s ability to run the game because every match the game crashes It s impossible for me to play this game now and others have been having the same issue To be honest it s infuriating when an update from the devs prevents you from even being able to play their game but when you purchase the game in early access you are voluntarily including yourself in the development of the game so wait until the game crashes after full release to get mad My review of the game itself  It s a fun battle royale game and is supposedly aiming for a console release this year so hopefully the bugs are worked out in time to make that possible The shooting mechanics are solid clear blood spurt from the enemy to indicate you ve landed a hit The melee combat is virtually pointless in the main game and isn t very reliable Player models are great unless your pc has a hard time running the game Player animations however are great regardless The difficulty of the game might turn some off from spending a lot of time trying to get better as there is a steep learning curve There is no tutorial so it d probably help most to watch someone play on youtube a bit to understand the core mechanics and basic structure of the game From my experience 196 hours the community isn t that toxic I haven t encountered any hackers yet nor have I been unfairly banned But both of those things are a possibility in this game more so than others so make sure you keep in mind how clean the devs would like to keep the servers,positive
Game not running on many computerdevs have to fix this firstbought this downloaded with turtle net for 2 days to just get disappointeddid all the possible fix but did not workif you are having problems with other steam gamesthen you should probably stay away from this gamei really like to play this game but i cant play it if it wont run on my pcFYImy pc can run Far Cry Primal 60fps on high settings,negative
I bought the game because all my friends are playing it and seem to have quite some fun An I totally agree that the idea and the approach is very good Nonetheless I have to adress the abismal performance I have the game on 720p70  resolution scale and it runs at an average of 40 maybe 45 going up just to 55 and very often going down to as low as 30 fps That is on a computer that definitely is dated but able to run CSGO at an average of 180 high settings and BF1 at an average of 80 fps medium settings Drivers of course updated It should therefore have no problem with running a game like this I know it s early access but the developer targets a release within Q4 2017 and I don t see how the performance could improve enough until then Other points of critique are that the game is still buggy but thats more likely to be fixed one more big point is that the developers push their questionable agenda with this game Banning a streamer because he teamkilled someone is an incredible overreaction and the reasoning behind that makes the developer seem like they want their game to be a safespace a shooter of all games Still this would not stop me from playing but the bugs and incredibly bad performance is I refunded it but would buy again if the performance issues will be fixed,negative
the game needs to be better with the lagg,positive
Im glad i run this game at 25 frames a second in most places insted of working on FPS and performance issus you release an unfinished game on mobile and add weapon skins into a game to try and make profitI come back for a game every few weeks and every time i feel like i have wasted time i had high hopes for this game but it seems like you want money more then a reputationFortnight is making you look like a pack of children you are trying to keep up with them insted of finishing your gamePUBG id dying and it wont be long till everyone who gave you a chance looks back and wonder why they bought your game Enjoy your decline in the spotlihght,negative
Great game the game looks really pretty if you have everything on ultra but there is one thing you guys should do Go threw the map and fiks some hills because in som hills it isn t any place to stand so you will just hover over the ground untill you are down on safe ground But other than that i am really enyoing the game Such a good game,positive

PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is a game that has a lot of potential with elements such as luck wit fast reactions  good aiming all playing a part in your demise or succcess in the game You get dropped via parachute on an island with up to 99 other players in an effort to be the last man standing Buildings and other killed players are looted for weapons their attachments ammunition as well as armour These items play an important part of survival as items such as armour may in you being able to withstand more damage before dying Items spawn randomly at the beginning of the game which adds to the element of chance although there are some high traffic areas where you are more likely to find better weapons such as the military base Luck however  can only take you so far as having environmental awareness plays a critical role on whether or not you spot the enemy before they spot you Sounds such as footsteps plays an important role in this process Here Bluehole as a developer has more work to do as nearby footsteps are not consistently audible Sound aside the game allows the player to use hisher wit to outsmart opponents Here using coverposition and effective evasive manoevers becomes important These tactics coupled with a fast reaction time and good aiming will in most cases result in you downing your enemy even if they have better weapons attachments and armour than you do I say in most cases as the game still suffers from significant stutter during close quarter combat encounters and using weapons such as the shotgun and the S12K is a hit and miss afair at the moment Currently even whilst aiming accurately at close quarters these weapons do not always hit the mark as intended The game is currently set for final release at the end of Q4 2017 We are nearing that mark  however in the game s current state I cannot help think that the developers  overambitious goals and the high expectations of millions of people who brought the game during early access is setting the game up to failEdit  24 September 2017  Some of the initial niggles that I have mentioned has been taken care of by the developers Positional sounds are more accurate close quarter combat is a smoother experience  playing from the UK on EU first person servers and the consistency of using shot guns and the S12K have been improved There are welcome additions to the game such as being able to set crosshair colour and the addition of the Mini 14 rifle I am  however still sceptical as to whether the final game as it was intended by the developers will be released by the end of Q4 2017Edit  22 December 2017  Three months on and I am glad that my prediction regarding the release of the game was wrong The game came out of early access on 20 December 2017 Significant improvements has been made and a new map was added This is a game that I think is worthy of the version 10 name You can now climb over objects and jump through windows The system works most of the time Ballistics has also been improved More often than not you hit your target as intended and the physics of bullet travel has been improved Bullet drag over longer distances for example is now a factor The developers has made big strides in enabling players to report hacking with the implementation of the optional death cam and replay features Unfortunately the game is by no means perfect Significant stutter persists at the beginning of the game and this is something I think the developers will need to focus on To conclude The state of the game at the moment is such that I think that I can now invest more time in mastering itEdit  01 March 2018  The state of the game remains dynamic It comes across as being more polished when compared to my initial review and subsequebt updates to it It is however  under threat of losing players to developers of other Battle Royale games who seem to be working harder at improving their game such as Fortrnite Cheating is one area which has been a focus for the developer Apart from using Battleye to combat it   they banned 25 million accounts during January 2018 they have also implemented their own backend anti cheat system At the moment I am not coming across cheaters during the games that I play  first person EU servers as much as I previously have I am aware of those that say that cheating is still rampant especially in third person perspective On the whole it does seem like the developers are making a concerted effort to tackle the issueThe game also feels more responsive when I play it Frame rates seem consistently higher stuttering is almost non existent and a new ping prioritisation system has been implemented The new ping priotisation system means that people with lower ping to the servers are grouped together In practice this results in less incidents where it comes across as being hit by bullets even though you are in cover Such a scenario was common in the past if for example when an Asian region player with a higher ping connected to an European or North American where players from those regions had significantly lower pingsWhilst the developers have clearly gone to great lengths to improve the game there are other developers that seems to be making greater strides to improve their Battle Royale games One such example is Fortnite  Updates in Fortnite are more frequent and the game feels more responsive at the time of this review These factors may lure some players away from PUBG If the PUBG developers take up the challenge competition between the two developers of these two games may result in a better experience for people who choose to play either,positive

AFTER RELEASE REVIEWAfter the release the game didn t get much better on the cheater side There is still loads of cheatersThere are some frustrating things in the game  The blue zone which hunts you constantly If you decide to move towards the middle of the circle and get attacked on the way there is no idea to stand and fight instead just get as fast as possible to the center of the circle find a good camping spot and hope people will kill each other   The controls are somewhat clunky and the movment feeling isn t there   The scavaging for 30mins to die once you see someone isn t fun  The scavaging for 1min and 20  of the time not getting that shotgun in the first room isn t much fun either  There should be a knock out limit getting tired of knocking people out from a distance only to let his friend bring him back up  The reward point system is forcing the players into playing solo if wanting to get some points Sharing the points would make it alot more balanced and rewardingThe game is fun when it comes to tactics and strategy with team mates but else from that I wouldn t recommend the game EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI like the game and the idea but there are so much problems with cheats lagg desync hitbox mess and other stuff which makes me not recommend this game Wait for it to be released and try it then is my recommmendations,negative

This game is fun and I enjoy it a lot Or at least that was the case As this game has risen in popularity so has the abundancy of hackers on OC and AS Servers 7 wall hackers in under two weeks getting one shot with a single Uzi round even tonight speed hackers two games back to back I just don t understand this  Hush Hush Nay Say  culture this game has You talk with other people and there is always someone calling you a liar Sometimes buildings take a long time to render allowing people to shoot through walls People actively exploit these bugs but that is not what I am talking about There are people doing these things 10 20 even 30 mins into the game I only call it if I know 100  that the target does not have even the potential for a line of sight and they hit me without missing a shot I m honestly not sure what the devs are doing about this The problem is getting worse each day and it seems that the devs care more about taking your money than stopping hackers There are MASSIVE flaws in this game that are just not getting dev attention Hacker rant out of the way when there are no hackers this is a thrilling game everyone is a hunter being hunted by real players Outsmarting outpositioning outplaying even just psyching out a player netting you a kill or a narrow escape is a great feeling These aren t stupid AI opponents but clever  arguably sometimes human beings constantly learning and adapting to the many situations and possibilies Each players play style is shaped by their personal experiences of trial and error and fatal mistakes Apart from exploiting the game itself there are no exploiting AI due to the lack thereof One tactic may work on one person but the next may have seen it before and knows how to counter it when you try it on them Now you know how to counter it for when someone tries it on you Now you can think of ways to counter that counter It is a game about survival evolution and of course Chicken DinnerA lot of fun but in its current state as an Aussie player experiencing many hackers and bugs I can t recommend it To people who live local to servers that AS players do not go on go ham Fun game,negative
The next groundbreaking competitive multiplayer game has the exact smae feel to when COD first came out The intensity The Teamwork The Heart Rate Still the best game around at the moment after being out for almost a year Will be inspiration for many devs to comeThe only thing i NEED for this game is for it to be on console PS4GG,positive
honestly i love this game to bits but the broken promise and the problems with the reporting system almost make me want to refund the game for that i suggest waiting for a full release when the problems are ironed out for that reason im going to not reccomend this game as of yetI hate this kind of review but its the best way to do this game IMOPros  interseting gameplay  best horror game i ve ever played  runs OK after the last few patchesCons  hackerscheaters shooting people through walls  MICROTRANSACTIONS after promising none until a full release  mass reporting from streamers being  harrased  cause people honk horns  if you know how to fiddle with the graphic settings you can see people on the over side of the map with ease yes the transactions are going to a tourney prize pool and allow for  free DLC  at a later date but it was a promise from the dev and tht breaks a lot of faith especially when the game has made over 150million in 4 months,negative

Let me get one thing straight first PUBG is in it s alpha stagesThis means that is still has  a lot of work to go through My  Alpha Review PUBG is a lot of fun I usually don t trust Early Access Games   cough   cough  Hurtworld  cough  but my reason for purchasing it is that even if it were abandoned it would still be a pretty fun game It has some cool components such as weapon customization vehicles cosmetics and supply drops It has solo duo and team modes  and First Person solo duo and squad modes that can either be played with friends or randos that the game automatically matches you with In my experience most of them have had microphones which is cool They never teamkill because the teamkill rules are WAY strict In the beginning of every game you can hear ALL of the mics and it s both annoying and hilarious There was one time when someone asked a guy named John to get on Discord and then replies came in saying  Yeah John get on Discord  and  John you re so stupid just get on Discord  Soon enough around 50 people were all telling John to get on Discord Also there are some problems with this game One of them is that people with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ier computers have the upper hand as less foliage is visible and shadows are more distinct This means that people hiding in bushes are easier seen by people running their computer at  Very Low  settings Another issue is that there are constant framedrops and network lags that sometimes  very rarely due to recent updates render the game unplayable unless you start a new game A few things I personally want at the time of release of this game are around 3 maps more vehicles  including different kinds of vehicles like maybe helicopters that can be shot down distinct foliage for all players a small crafting system and an attach button when picking up itemsOverall At Its Current Stage I Give This Game A 7510You should definitely get this game but be weary that there are a lot of problems and patience is key with this game If you re here to know either PUBG or H1Z1 PUBG is the better choice If you re kinda skeptical wait until a sale and get it for like 10 or 15 bucks Then it s definitely worth it,positive
trash tier game you load in to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  little kids screaming and then die as soon as you land in whatever spot you drop to you need to double tap the right mouse button just to use iron sights which is time consuming and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t there is no info for new players so you have no idea what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is going on at any time,negative

TL DR   Great game intense fun crazy Negative posters are crybabies over an optional paid crate that has no affect on in game expierence They need to use their 250 to get a new pacifier to fall alseep in their safe space Don t listen to the cry babies This game is great It s intense fun always challening and always keeps you coming back for more Everyone is crying over a paid micro transaction that only gets you cosmetic items that affect the game play in no way at all Simple solution if you don t want to be part of the microtransaction to fund charities and their tournament Din t buy the damn key to unlock the crate and instead sell your crate for 3 seems pretty simple but these damn gamers nowadays need their pacifier to fall asleep at night The developers are working to fix bug issues and listen to the community to resolve issues I have over 100 hours on this game and it s still as entertaining as the first match I played probably more so since I know where to go and how to survive longer now Pick it up you won t be disapointed,positive
Great game in my top ten s all time I ve never been experienced adrenaline rush and heart bitting before like in PUBG and you can earn the money selling crates for  for steam walletI definitely recommended PUBG to everyone even at full price and in early access  ,positive
For the price this game is incredibly fun You need a beefy computer to turn up the settings at the moment Lower the settings and it is very playable Dont take getting killed personal,positive

Way to buggy for a game that has sold ridiculous amounts you d think they would have fixed it by now There only one map around 15 guns and one type of gamemode This is not allot of content again for a game that s sold so much you d think they have the money to give it a few content updatesThen there s the crap in game cash grabs like  loot  crates which you earn from playing but then have to pay to open    And then there s the performance I m running this on 2x1080ti s and i get around 40fps MAX on mediumlow settingsHonestly it s got the ground work to be a good game however at this moment it s really not that good for the money,negative
Ever since the First person servers came out about every 110 games I join the buildings will never render and I end up falling through buildings as well as can just run through walls I am forced to quit the match for fear of being banned Developers are more concerned about some tournament and loot crates than making the game work as intended,negative

Buggiest game I ve ever played Most of the time you will die to stupid bugs and glitches Instead of fixing the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game the devs implemented crate and key microtransaction system So you can enjoy wasting your money when trying to play a broken game,negative
Really fun game but you need 10k PC to run it normall,positive
game still severely broken yet devs more interested in microtransactions during EA than fixing the game going down the track that this game will never be completed once the devs have made their money best advice to avoid for the time being until the greedy devs get the message,negative
Got into game Once I landed I was able to walk through every building in sight They looked like half formed blobs barely resembling buildings After trying to go up what I can only assume was a ramp I fell through the floor and was stuck with half my body int he ramp When I exited the game throuhg the menu the game froze my pc and after about 2 min I was able to get to see my desktop but the game was STILL running It was hogging 96  of my ram thus making everything move very slowly I was unable to close it from task manager so I manually shutdown my pc The only good thing about this game is the cleaning session it sparked once I shut down my computerEDIT  Second game Crashed after clicking play on main menuEDIT  Continues to disappoint You will literally ahve a clear shot at a target standing still and will somehow hit the ground in front of you or some part of the window and I m 25 games for crashing with blob buildings,negative
game is rlly good the only thing i would have to say that should be alittle longer is the blue circle i do like the system but it really gives you no time to scavage for stuff i think it would be alot better if it wasnt so fast still keep it in just make it alittle longer or start it off slow then as u get twords the middle it gets faster each step something like that,positive
I have over the recomended specs yet sometimes I crash,positive
Great game great experience still having issues at times but you should definitely buy it if you enjoy playing games like H1Z1  Just Survive or Arma 3 BattleroyaleOne important thing  don t take in consideration the bad reviews about microtransaction Both the community and the devs got to benefit from it People are crying about a lot of things and I bet that most of the owners that have given this game a bad review actually got themselves some money back from it through the microtransaction system With this method of getting the crates   you have to play to get some in game currency so you can buy those crates and then sell them or open them the choice is yours  it encourages players to get better at it but to not camp If you end on the 26th but without kills you ll be awarded with less points than if would end on the 70th place after you ve killed 3 playersTL DR  The game is good Buy it and enjoy it If your system is not that great you might want to check some gameplays of this with those specs so you can make sure that your computer will be able to run it I m playing it on a GTX 970 and i7 4790K   8 GB of RAM  and I can run it above 60 FPS only if I set most of its settings to mediumlowvery lowPros   It s a really good game gunfight is great  The wider variety of guns   compared to H1Z1  and gun attachments make it a superior game   again compared to H1Z1   Armor actually gives you some protection A level 3 helmet protects you from a couple of shots   while in H1Z1 2 headshots with a helmet on meant that you were dead Cons   The game still needs a lot of work   especially optimisation   There are times in which the buildings don t load entirely   for me at least  and I can t get inside those I have to wait a couple of seconds   sometimes a minute  so it can load properly and I can loot some items Got killed sometimes because of this issue hopefully they ll fix this soon  The spawn system for items should be worked on If you are about to land in a zone with a lot of buildings and you are unlucky to get a gun even a pistol in the first place you get to loot then you are most likely dead I understand that this is how the game works but it can be really annoying  The loot system needs improvement too There were times when I tried to loot a certain item   having my crosshair on it  and it grabbed some other items next to it Not to mention that items can spawn so close to each other that you ll prefer to open up the inventory to drag and drop them in your bag but can get yourself killed,positive
Dope game 12345,positive
This game may be the king of its genre but it s not a good game and I don t understand the level of hype it s gotten For whatever reason there is a fanaticism around this game that ignores glaring flaws This game is saddled with insanely inconsistent hit detection lag compensation issues a really poor tick rate and some of the worst RNG I ve ever seen 90  of the time the game would be more aptly described as Running Simulator You re often punished for having to fight other players based on timing of the play zone On top of that this game has some really poor moderation policies where basically they suck up to streamers at the expense of the rest of the playing world The game is a mess The developer is a mess The community is a mess Again why this game is so populary is beyond me It s simply not good,negative

I would definatley recomend this game as you can either have a laugh playing this game or you can take it serious trying to win and grinding the game for points to customize your characterThe market is okay because the things you can buy will not give you an advantage they will just give a stylish edge to your characterThe game is going to be a great if the developers carry on with this aporoach as it will create a level and skillful playing field for the multiplayer experience,positive
I bought the game a week ago and have not played it since the houses just dont load in I have an nvidia gtx 970 with 8gb of ram and the houses just dont load inthurthermore when the houses try to load in it comes up with network lag detected and the game freezes for like 2 mins before coming back renderedThis ruins the game for me as i was enjoying itIf this gets fixed  also the memory leaks i will play it alot moreBut for now this game has disappointed me devs get working on this,negative
A very good game I recommend it,positive
It has a great concept I really don t care about microtransactions if anything I got 7 from selling the crates on the market which is fine for me The problem is really in 2 spots though as  1 the networks are so laggy that you will shift a bit every few seconds  this isn t my internet DayZ is a larger world and this doesn t happen and  2 the game restricts you to playing low or maybe medium I have a 980ti and a 4790k and I still can t get 60 fps on medium which you think would be a standard graphics level for mid tier builds I only recommend this game if you do have a good computer  1050 ti or better and if you are fine with waiting for them to sort out the bugs,negative

Not bad,positive
Great game but devs need to get proirities striaght fixfinish the game first before adding on dlc or paid content to a not even complete game,negative
They updated it so that you can spend more money on loot boxes with horrible drop rates in order to push the extreme prices in the Marketplace up  They do get a cut on top of the billions they got for people buying the game So if you want to look cool you have to spend a bunch more money plus the hundreds you have to spend on your  to get this ugly LOVE LOVE LOVE  game up to 60fps with half decent settings,negative
It was okay untill they thought they could financially take advantage of us And with their ridiculous bans,negative
overpriced game with a obscene budgetYet does not even have the most basic features of any competitive multiplayer gamesIt has terrible netcode terrible hit detection terrible animations that make the game feel like it was made by some highschoolers doing a project in unity It has problems with the servers being laggy and people with high ping have an advantage It encourages you playing on wrong servers to get a advantage over other people due to peekers advantage,negative
Overall  Good game but it needs a lot of work still Good thing it is still a work in progress otherwiseYeah Bad newsThe main parts of the game rely on luck and that can be a good or bad thing For example Gun Car and other player spawns You along with 90 somthing other people jump out of a plane and land on an islandYour main goal is to gather weapons and armour quickly enough and to kill off everyone else while running from an ever emposing death circle to become the victorI Recomend this game for the Person who loves a skillluck based shooter For now i Give this game a C,positive

Overall solid game a few bugs and such but it is still early access with the microtransactions comming in alot of negative people shown up but it goes to prize money and charity plus you are not forced to buy the cosmeticts they do nothingHowever i will reccomend playing with friends for some laughs solo is alright,positive
The game feels and runs like garbage Crashes often as well,negative
Good game but has problems1 Devs keep producing new content instead of optimising and fixing bugs2 Hackers everywhere and no real way to deal with them in game3 Crashes randomly a lot4 Get the same map over and over again without being able to choose wich map you want to play5 Bugs are everywhere and devs seem too not worry about them,positive
Cant even get a good PVP server even without japanese or asians and all the zombie servers are full,negative
Fun game but the development team needs to re think their position on server optimization and bug fixes before rolling out cosmetic and paid content You ll have a good time playing it for a little while at least But the game was not even close to being out of early release It won t contend with traditional games like CS GO or DOTA2 and doesn t have the support that more contemporary games like Fortnite The community is unfortunately shrinking because of this which makes it difficult for newcomers to get over the steep unforgiving learning curveFind a friend to play with and have a good time with it And be careful of getting hit with a random ban here and there,negative

This game is insane and its not even done yet so it just gets better Get it now and start playing,positive
Very repetitive Paid for keys,negative
A great game but with each massive community it toxicity will appear The gameplay is great guns feel like they have a real punch to them Shotgun range is actually accurate to real life for one thing A great game to play with friends But the community can be horrible The discussion page will be filled with nothing but people complaining about microtranscation which are for charity and prize pool for a tournament Even so there are stilll free crates with quality loot One complaint I have would be the attitude of the developers and them leaning to side with streamers in any heat that occurs Bans are not something they will have a hard time doing But as long as you don t team in solo stream snipe or exploit bugs or glitches you ll be fine The major flaw to this game is it is not well optimized but this is an early access game and a very good one at that The developers even same to make sure it doesn t stay in early access for to long But overall this is a game I ve put many hours into and whole heartdly enjoy a great game especially with friends,positive
First of all its alot of bugs Like stucking between car and three or when you are tying to crounch by the fance Always lagsAs more as you are playing you cant find any loot Guess admins did small chance to find weapons,negative
Crates and keys for cosmetics while the game still runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the first 5 minutes of the game are so incredibly laggy its unplayable the list of bugs is endless yet here our dev team is making crates and keys to take money while the game is still in early access Nice priorities,negative
This game is by far my favorite game on the market Many poor reviews are frustrated players who can t seem to win This game involves skill tactical skills awareness etc There are many pros to this game which include the realism to it Bullet drop trajectory damage dealt by certain guns and overall just very realistic Although this game does have some pretty bad cons These include hackers glitches and laggy servers HACKERS  Honestly everyone complains about hackers but i ve only come across a few in the 200 hours spent I ve only ever died by a hacker 2 times and this was when i was playing duos or squads GLITCHES  I ve encountered a glitch one time and this was a motorcylce getting stuck and blew up randomly  LAGGY SERVERS  Sometimes you will be put into laggy servers from time to time do not get frustrated it usually passes within the first 10 minutes ps  Not all servers are laggy about 10  are laggy  stick to your region  Overall the game is very competitive and very very fun once you get used to it SIDE NOTESGame involves skill dont go guns blazing into a firefight time it perfectly and always be aware of your surroundings Do not be shy You need to be aggressive and not be scared to fight when it is needed Always keep your inventory clear and not filled with stupid items like 5 grips for your m4 that you already have equipped etc Always play with a headset so you can hear footsteps and gunfire UPDATE REVIEWSome things i noticed with the new update as of April 2nd 2018  is that the redzone has become much more dangerous Guns seem to be a little bit decreased in damage such as the sks UMP has seemed to increase damage  that is not 100  correct just what i feel i noticed,positive

The game was good extremely enjoyable even but then they absolutely broke the gameBefore the microtranscation patch the game in my experience ran flawlessly and I had a great time In fact I enjoyed it soo much to the point where I sank 90 hours into the game Then the patch cameNot only has this patch shown that the developers can not make a promise  no paid micro s during EA it also completely destroyed the stability of the game As evident for many users constant game breaking freezes and buildings not rendering for certain people completely make the game unplayable in many situations especially since these issues occur extremely often in around 50  of the games I play now Somehow due to a recent mini patch these freezes have been able to blue screen me something which has not happened for years Keep in mind that PlayerUnknown himself is making questionable decisions and that the dev s believe that stream sniping deserves bans  it does not as the streamers can fix it themselves Absolutely disgusting I will still play the game as I love it but the dev s have become untrustworthy10 Update   300 hours in  Edit on241217What a dissapointment this was I have been playing on the PTR  PTS etc since it came out and I can happily say that the really important problems have not been fixed Easily the biggest issue is the severe rubber banding that still occurs in every single match I play varying from severe to barely noticable  usually severe This affects the early gunplay massively as everyone is teleporting around plus it becomes really difficult to loot on a map that is scarce with loot in the large buildings Additionally your early game foes may not be experiencing the rubber banding absolutely spelling your doom when they find you In fact this problem has made me begin to despise playing this game as most games cause me to die not from a lack of skill or mistake but the network just ramming me more than the other guy 3 metres in front of me Furthermore I have begun to hate the new map as they decided to prioritise it to a stupid ratio so its always the new map compared to keeping it balanced with Erangel How could I possibly enjoy the new map when every experience is downright trash and the good moments only happen when the lag stops  I feel as if this really ruins all of the great things that they added with this release such as the new UI Sounds Replay System Gunsand Improved Framerate The fact that they released the game and didn t fix the rubber banding LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed audio  red zone and directional sound despite the fact that it was in the ptr is just a spit in the faceEdit  They seem to be finally addressing the lag,negative

While the game is interesting at first After the first couple of playthroughs you have expeirence the whole game There is nothing new to do You go in get your gear get a car and just kill people for no reason The gameplay gets so repetative due to the lack of objective besides killing people Cant reccomend this game with so little content For some reason its the only games my friends play atm so im obliged to complyEDIT  While this was my original review i v come to the consensus that if the develpers keep supporting and updating the game as they have been such as adding new maps mechanics and improving framrate then for 30 bucks it is worth it,positive

Edit  This game in my opinion has reached it s true potential it has become a fully released title gets constant updates and bug fixes now has been optimized and have released one new map in the main game and one in the test servers as well This is now a reccomendation on my end  if you care but I will leave what I wrote previously below as the companies previous priorities should not be forgottenI love this game the gameplay is amazing But as of now it seems as if the devs care more about making money than making the game playable Instead of fixing pc and server optimization they update the game to add more LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  micro transaction Loot Crates Game is good  but Bluehole needs to get there priorities straight,positive
Of all the games I have played in my years PUBG is one of my favorite games to play Im not a big fan of battle royal but the game play has made me enjoy it very much There are occational bugs but that is understandable in an early access game and sometimes the game does lag a bit But in general this is a game I highly recommend this game to everyone It got recommended to my by a friend he told me play this game and it will change your life   its true the first few games I played I played solo matches and I was sh t scared  p The game has plenty potential for modding and the dev s are making constant changes making game play even better and adding new things to make the players enjoy it even more I strongly recommend this game to everyone,positive
Runs better than Rust but it s still full of UI bugs servers always down and awful gun mechanics Makes playing this game like hell especially if you play with friendsBut I ll still give it a positive review because there is no other game like this on Steam which is what makes it so popular It s really fun and exciting and each game is different Just as if you were in your own Hunger Games,positive
Best game forever,positive

My experience with this game be me have mildly annoying friends whose names are Vector and ScarL ScarL promises to give a x4 scope to Vector Vector doesn t get his scope in time Vector wants to knock out ScarL He mistakes me for ScarL I get downed wtfpng I proceed to get angry ScarL walks into the room ScarL also gets downed I get revived cause we are friends I proceed to shoot Vector then revive ScarL ScarL revives Vector Vector downs me again ffs_stopjpg I tell ScarL to knock Vector out and he does I get revived I revive Vector Vector knocks out ScarL I also get knocked out We both get revived and stops We lost that game1010 would kill my friend again,positive

great game hours of enjoyment but one question does anyone else have the buildings be the last thing in the entire game to load i have a good computer and can run the game on good settings its so infuriating when you get killed because you cant go into a building to get a gun when you first drop out thats just me asking if anyone else gets this apart from that its a great game with little tweaks needed,positive

A game riddled with lag desync and bugs and what do they do  Oh yeah they add RNG based loot crates that can only be opened with keys that you must pay for In early access And they promised not to implement these microtransactions before the full releaseGiven the developers geed and that the game is borderline unplayable at the moment your best option would be to wait for full release or just not buy at all,negative
Banning people for honking car horns near  streamers  thus introducing 2 classes of players  Streamers who can claim harassment and get their will and everybody else who will just get bannedMicrotransactions added during EA phase  which they promised not to doIn a game about seeing while not being seen character outfits are gameplay related Call it  cosmetic  all you want it just isn tDO NOT BUY,negative

Nice game and I really would recommend it  BUT there are so many f  ing bugs which is totally annoying no new mods etc Solve you issues please  until that I am out  which is a pity because I used to love that game,negative
Its really hard to follow the direction and road map for this game  Some patches are great and the game play is solid then the next week everything is nerfed  I get itis early access  What I don t get is why an Early Access game that is promissed to not have micro transactions now has them  Yes its cosmetic only but it just goes to show you that they are flip flopping on everything from the direction of the game and overall scope of the gameAt mid range and long range the game excels  Up close battles are plauged with netcode an d sync issues  It doesn t appear that its a priority to fix those which is suprising considering most of the action you get in this game is in the very start when you land  close combatI have over 222 hours in the game and did enjoy it but until they get a more solid roadmap and stick with what they promised I am not recommending the game for new users  You should wait for it to come out of early access if you don t want end up complaining and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing like myself and the others   ,negative

Playerunknowns battleground is a new hype which in my opinion is well deserved The game itself plays great and is easy to start with I have read a lot of negative reviews about the game lately where I just couldnt agree with The microtransaction system They promised to not involve real money in the state of early access but still did That is ofcourse not the way it should be Although they also couldnt know the game would become this popular A lot of people care a LOT for cosmetics in games I think because it has no disadvantages  in my opinion to have those cosmetics As I already stated I DO understand people feel like Bluehole lied to them But still lets just be honest the game itself is great and not worth a negative reviewBecauseThe game improved The last few patches broke some things but lets be honest that was only for 1 or 2 days to a maximum They have admitted it was a failed patch as well so just take it as it is The moment I started playing this game the game was 1 big FPS fail The game was laggy as hell and nowadays I get a REAL steady FPS People normally forget things like thatThe game isnt out for that long and already has a lot of features added bugs fixed and visual improvements They listen to the feedback the community is providing them and patch gamebreaking bugs WAY earlier than Im used toThe game itself The game is just great Like we all know there are a lot of hyped concepts which failed big time this one isnt in the same boat This game nailed the battle royale concept just perfectly Where h1z1 has that arcade type of feeling this game has a somewhat realistic taste Which plays really well Shooting is more rewarding than ever The map is real big and the vehicles arent an unfair advantage to people who dont have one People really have their own way of playing this game You normally really have a choice in what kind of situations you want to play in this game You move to an area with multiple houses for closemid range encounters or you move to an area on a mountain where you may be able to snipe people from far awayThe variety in this game is just great If you ask me should I buy this game  DONT hesitate DO IT   BUT  I would suggest bringing some friends with you which definitely makes it more fun to play,positive
Still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Seriously this game will be gone in the 4 years later,negative
Great game Fun and addictive Honestly half the people complaining about microtransactions are just hopin on the bandwagon The microtransactions in this game do nothing to effect your enjoyment  Edit  I know they promiced not to add microtransactions into the game however the money made from these microtransactions are to go towards the gamescon pubg invitational  Overall if you have a decentokay computer then you should definitley look into getting this game as its completely worth its price Its a great mix between arma and h1z1 If arma was to hard for you and you didnt quite like h1z1s style then this is perfect Infact anyone will have a absolute blast playing this game with or without friends PUBG or playerunkowns battlegrounds has great character movement and is extremely satasfying when you get yourself a kill Me personally cannot stop playing and I dont look to quiting in the future,positive
Waste of 66GBs of hard drive space,negative
Best game of the year for me Its fun by yourself or your friends or with randoms This game gets very intense and sweating at the end of the game in a 1v1 2v2 or 4v4 I love the fact the developers keep updating the game with bigger and better it just proves that the developers care very much with PUBG The gameplay is for everyone new or experienced and always can learn and be better at the game and win Winning in this game is the happiest feeling you will ever have in your gaming history experience Keep doing what you are doing developers  3,positive
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS or  PUBG  is a Battle Royal FPS that incorperates jumping out of a plane with 90 other players all with nothing on them but the cloths on there backs in a fight to the death for the chance to recieve a  WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER  reward if you die thats it no respawnthe concept is fairly rinse and repeat Jump out of plane    try and find  armour weapons first aid    make sure you are always in the circle    try and be the last man standing you would think that over time this would get pretty repetetive but that is sooo far from the truth and its only in the beta stagesthe variations of outcomes based on your decisions make for a very unpredictable and exciting time playing solo is always a rush but with a squad is where teamwork really comes into playAll in all this is a fantasic game loads of hours of gameplay to be had,positive

Okay they did lie about not putting micro transactions Makes me kinda tilted But nonetheless it s a pretty sweet game It s kind of like the Hunger Games actually in a PC game I d probably get it on sale if I were you Not to be rude but this company really doesn t deserve people paying full price for their games that they promise lies in When you get right down to all of it this game s in a RIP situation Gameplay s good though if you want to buy it,positive
WE LOVE CRATESSome people complain too much that they made crates  instead  of fixing the game even tho last time i checked ive been running the game better since the update Making the whole crate system isnt bad you can get all the crates by playing the game or buying them from other people who played the game and that money goes to the person who played the game got the crate and sold it because of this  you could literally make back your money from this game so easily by playing the game and selling your crates which are about 2 right now Its better to have the option to be able to buy crates than not buy them because its not something you have to do its your choice if you dont like it then just play the game This is all about what you want this isnt forced for you to go and open the crates that require money Just sell your crates and get money back from having funAlso when you do buy a Key from PUBG Parital amount of the money goes towards CHAIRTY and the Gamescon Prize Pools CRATES FUEL THE COMMUNITY,positive

This game is literally fantastic The reason these negative reviews are showing up is because people want crates which is pathetic The rest of these guys didn t complain when the crates would give you low teir items but now you can buy crates for BP  battle points earned in game and still have a great time If anything the crates are the most pointless part of the game and serve no meaning other than cosmetics You literally do not get guns or any armor or advantages from these craes So when you see a review about  micro transaction  realize that they are talking about worthless cosmetic BS,positive
Can t believe I was influenced to buy this game from the reviews People buying this game in alpha just blows my mind Plays like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and looks like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
PC volume 100 game volume 100 still can t hear LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Please fix this I love the game but it is very hard to play with low sound I understand that for some it is overly loud though Either way the sound needs work If you can t hear in PUBGs you re as good as deadUpdate Found out what the sound issue was If you are having problems check out this linkhttps wwwhowtogeekcom244963how to adjust the volume for individual apps in windows,positive

I don t get all the hate because of microtransactions Its purely cosmetic stuff You can choose to buy or choose not too I for one don t mind giving a few bucks here and there to a company that listens to the gamers I absolutely love the game and where it s going and quite possibly where it will be in the future As long they keep listening to the gamers I see this game being played for many years to come,positive

This game hits all the points for online shooter with friends or solo There is no boring start where we all know who is using what gear no one knows what anyone will get until you hit the ground and start running The gameplay is intense in the sense that you have no map saying HE IS RIGHT THERE and you cannot necessarily see the guy about to ventilate your dome piece If you enjoy the challenge of finding gear and outsmarting apponents through maneuver and engagement this is the game for you I have seen more matches come to a close based on smoking apponents out  literally and waiting until the right time to hit them for the win A must have title for die hard shooter fans and a must try for new blood into the genre Pros   Great graphics Decent selection of weapons Large map  at least enough that it does not feel crowded in the beginning with 100 players Regular effective updates  Solid gameplay and reactive controls  The added Horns to the game 1010 will charge across the bridge blairing the horn until shot to death again Cons  Graphics settings   go ahead and put the grass and foliage as low as you can you may be in tall grass hidden with your 1080 to all ready to strike but billy with his dads outdated laptop sees your dumbass lying in an open field with nothing around you Weapons can be spotty with damage sometimes you will shoot someone once and drop them other times you will shoot the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of them and they will kill you  it is alpha and the system is still being balanced Vehicle mechanics are hilarious hit a buggy with your buggy and fly into the air sailing 5 map grid squars to plunge to your death 1010 will do agian Overall if you can get over the minor hangups which come with a well developed pre release game this is the game for you this is the game i stream and play the most with friends at the moment We have had many hours of hilarious deaths and stressfull butt clenching wins See you guys in the battle royale,positive
Fun to play with friends for a couple of hours at a time def worth the money,positive
Microtransactions in an Early Access game No thank you I mean the game is great i have sunken over 200 hours into it but it is not truly released and they are already going back on their word Bluehole needs to fix lag spikes fps issues and glitches instead of money grabbing with microtransactions The game has sold millions of copies No need to be greedy Bluehole Other than that and the occasional hacker this game is awesome sauce,positive
Weapons are meh similar to CS but lacking any real diversity  Yes its early access so you have to temper your expectations with that in mind  I dont really want to give this game a thumbs up or down its more like sideways  Get this game if you re good with snipers and dont mind waiting on additional content  Wait on buying it if you want a more complete game experienceThere is a promise of new maps and weapons but details of those has not been very forthcomingbtw  for those of you who feel the need to comment dont bother I m just going to delete them anyway,negative
Doesn t show LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Bad game,negative
good game would play again,positive
Played it for about 3 hours and requested refund and got Squad instead There is a cash shop one map and insane lag on high end systems due to lack of optimization After an hour you will have played everything this game has to offer so it includes a ton of repetition Cash shop poor optimization hackers and lack of content make this game very boring Last man standing isnt strong enough of a game mode to carry the whole thing If you want tactics and depth go elsewhere If you want to camp until you have to move zones to camp again then by all means have at it,negative
I do enjoy this game and up until the last update I would recommend it to anyone That being said I can no longer play the game every time I open the game I have issues now If I make it past the loading screen without it freezing it works fine until I play the game After exiting the plane and landing on the ground the textures will not load and the game freezes I have uninstalled and re installed the game with no success So overall good concept but the game is unplayable for me so I have no choice but to not recommend it,negative

This game should be retitled to PLAYERUNKNOWN S MICROTRANSACTION GAMBLING DENInstead of doing the microtransaction model the right way which gives those who want the outfits for a reasonable price they do it in the most scummy way possible by LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing gambling your way to it  Aside from the insulting RoC which panders to snowflakes who can t control their emotions the game is enjoyable for the most part  I will amend my review when things change so that it remains accurate to current state of the game,negative
This is my far one of my most favorite games I ve always been major fan of Arma and DayZ but the only problem with them too is either it s too boring at times or there s FPS issues of game performance issues Now PUBG is basically the child of the two Just wait till PUBG is fully released I sure hope this game wins GOTY it TRULY deservers it PLEASE do not read about any of those stuped micro transaction comments that s not what makes the game bad at all it does not affect the game whatsoever Please I REALLY encourage you to buy PUBG,positive

Apart from the optimisation issues which tend to make you mad because it doesn t run 60fpspcmasterrace on every machine  and on every area of the map the game is aweasome    Play it alone and get mad at people because you got shot from the outside world  Please add death cam so I can salt even more   Play it with a friend and enjoy blamming him for your own mistakes   Play it with squads and enjoy the motorcycle rides  or not cause your friends will most likely get you killed trying to do a backflip on that sidecart crapOverall    1010 would get sniped again,positive

The game itself is fun  when I get to play most of the time the game causes my PC to black screen so I have to force restart it Does the company behind PUBG plan to replace parts of my PC because their game destroyed them   Doubtful they only care about getting their money from micro transactions  like they said they wouldn t doI would reccomend the game if it was working properly and if the creators didn t bold faced lie to the players,negative
really fun even without friends cant wait for 10,positive
I can t get behind hate for the game just because of paid loot boxes this is a game that even in early access you can easily sink hundreds of hours into  Yes it s buggy Yes it can be frustrating Yes occasionally you get rounds where you lag in the beginning and end up dying It sucks  The game is early access Deal with it or don t play it until an actual official 10 release,positive

The game in its self is good but the devs don t care about the averege player they are just doing it for money adding paid crates in EA  wich they clearly stated that they would not do and the streamers have way too much power like you get banned for every little thing and with no evidence if you want the game dont buy it now wait untill its out of EA cus right now its a pile of trash,negative

The game while extremely fun in theory is extremely unrewarding The entire gist of the game is to attempt to be the final survivor and the struggles you face along the way Having that intense firefight in the school or a sneaky chase on a high profile target through the warehouse is supposed to truly be the highlight of the game This is OK and is one of the things I love about this game EXCEPT for the fact that after its done its done It doesn t feel rewarding at all to be anything but the last man standing I feel like the game should be more rewarding towards being at least top 20 In the current state theres no difference between dying in 10th place and dying in 80thI will say that I would probably had a way better experience had I been able to play for a bit more Several of my games would end abruptly due to just crashes or the game would randomly run poorly even on the lowest settings I have a GTX 1060 so I m not sure if that makes any difference It s still a fun game though for the experience but the aftermath is all that irks me but hey I knowingly paid 30 dollars for an early access game that s pretty damn finished outside of those crashes,positive
ITS a nice game good graphic and concept hope will have more map sooncoz now most of the player already memorize the  map will be better all the loot make it rendom,positive
HUGE PATCH  Way less hackers  haven t seen one in the past 100 matches  Awesome Balance changes  New guns and vehicles are great  The game feels very optimized now 50 70 FPS on i3 4150  GTX 750 Ti  8GB RamI suggest you buy itI ve had sooo much fun As long as you know the mechanics and know what you are doingGo watch WackyJacky if you think you suck He has short and very perfect videos,positive
The sheer amount of bugs cheaters paid content after buying a full game and pure carelessness by the developers makes a would be incredible game the sleaziest most futile gaming experience ever It s so bug ridden you can feed an entire third world country off of frying the bugs in this game on a barbecue dipped in soy sauce,negative

who cares if they added microtransactions even when they said they wouldn t theyr e just supply crates and completely voluntary to purchase as the free ones still remain this game is really really addictive and probably the best shooter i ve play this year and I don t think all of these negative reviews should deter you from such a fun experience,positive
Fun game once you get the mechanics and stuff down More fun to play as a group with friends,positive
Extremely satisfying and fun with ARMA and H1Z1 s bases this game is a masterpiece Except there are still many bugs It is still in early access so i hope they ll be fixed,positive
Pros   Lots of quick fun looting driving and sneaking about  Weapons are upgradeable Sights mags Stocks exc Armor and equipment is fairly easy to getCons   Players who jump out of cars and insta kill you and your teammates with a headshot 3000 for a 1500 game Both  Graphic s and content  wise,positive
I like this,positive

 Stoner Review PlayerUknowns BattleGrounds Or Pubg is youre a normal personFrom a Gameplay point of view  its incredibleBullets wizzing past your head Snapping and Cracking all round you Or that door you just closedbeing ripped to shreads by that guy with the tommy gun you missed Having and epic 4 on 4 battle hanging out the side of a UAZ blazing through a forest at 110khm Looking over at a friend simply to watch the head of your teamate burst into a red cloud of mist as he stands idle looting the body of a fresh kill Only to see a new challenger on the horizon These are hardly even scratching the surface of the carzy and unexpected moments that really get your heart moving  This spawns the feeling of always having to come in cluch Always having to surviveThis feeling manages the pace of the game creating both fast and slower sides of the thrill With minutes turning to seconds in what feels like the blink of eyeIts hard to keep track of whats what Running in and out of buidings hearing the hiss of guns shots all around you Or queitly stalking from the shadows Any way you chose to play the game it will be nothing short of a thrill ride With danger potentially around every cornor Every step you take puts you on a knifes edge  Every moment could be your lastAll this being said it has its issues But I like to belive the devs are working a lot harder than people give them credit for to SLOWLY create the smoothing running pubg we all long for8510 Highly recommend,positive
one of the most  addictive games i have played,positive
nice game But i have 10 fps   ,positive
300 hours into this game and it has steadily gotten worse Full release is just over a week away and this game is still barely playable on east coast Between lag frame rate loss due to pour optimization and dealing with aimbots this game is sadly not worth the money Hopefully when it goes live there will be a very large patch to fix all the issues but most likely not,negative
Devs are liars Promised that there would not be micro transactions while in Early Access Spoiler Alert  there is The devs are moving so slowly on this game for the money that they have made off of it Oh yeah they also ban anyone who streamers say are  stream sniping  so when you get banned out of the blue for killing a streamer look out,negative

Dunno why people are crying about microtransactions it means free money for me     ,positive
Great game a bit buggy right now  It s an early access though  Still enjoying myself with it regardless,positive
When I first reviewed this game I gave it two thumbs up with so much hope for what looked like the future of multiplayer gaming PUBG has done an amazing job of creating a game with a very universal appeal that is easy to pick up and learn but with so many nuances that can take hundreds of hours to master The game offers intense fights decently spaced out updates and  a very large active commmunity However several things have changed recently that have caused me to no longer recommend this to any self respecting gamer unless several aspects are addressed They are as follows  In no particular orderLoot crates I guess the real person to blame here is EA for making loot crates popular or maybe it s the fault of every gamer who has abused a credit card company and created a higher demand for loot crates After all if they didn t sell why would companies even try  With that said I find it scummy to say the least that a small company would openly decieve a large faithful playerbase like the one PUBG is lucky to have The thing that urks me the most is the fact that you now receive loot crates as a reward for performance but you can t even unlock them without paying something like 2 per key per box That s just for one box Previously the boxes came unlocked Considering how incredibly ugly the textures and models are for this game I feel like paying for these loot crates is a huge money grab and is blatantly disrespectful Region locked servers  or rather lack thereof I m not going to sit here and say every Chinese player is hacking or exploiting the game but I will say that regardless of their intentions easily half of my games end in some form of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t The first form being straight up ping differences causing gameplay that no longer is based around skill but on responses from the server Speaking of dying to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t  hackers There was a time when you would hardly see any hackers and the PUBG news feed was full of announcements of large scale bans Now it seems like every 2 or 3 matches I  admittedly with some salt watch a death cam and watch as someone seemingly turns out of nowhere perfectly locks onto my head and teabags me like we re in the UK My last complaint is the general bugginess surrounding the game Several months ago I attributed this just to being in Early Access and figured they could fix it given the time and steadily flowing income Still if my game isn t ruined by a hacker or lag me or one of my friends I m trying to play a round with will either have their games freeze up completely sometimes requiring an entire restart or they will just get disconnected  Pro tip  if you have Windows 10 and your PUBG freezes up and won t let you close out nor leave the screen press the windows button  tab click on  new desktop  in the bottom right and from there you can open your windows manager CTRLALTDELETE if needed and won t have to restart or relog into windows No idea why this works or why it s so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing annoying All in all unless the developers seriously turn it around this game will inevitably go the way of H1Z1 Still a fun game but there is no reason to support such LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  management I much like many others in the community will be waiting for any not brain dead company to make a better battle royale In the mean time might I suggest Fortnite ,negative
Most of the game s early access problems have been solved   except one   Mass cheating and server hopping by Chineese players For whatever reason Chineese players choose to play on NA servers and teamkilling any non chineese squadmates They also make up the vast majority of Cheaters The fact that cheating is so widespread like this is ridicoulous When players asked for a region lock  a very reasonable request the devoloper responded by calling us racist At the very least they should be forced to play on their own server If not for this problem the game would be Alright But this problem is really ruining the game for me and thousands of other players                                     ,negative

Faster than the snail speed of DayZ Pace is slower than H1Z1 but it s not cartooney This is a bad a battle royale alpha that has dominated the charts well before it s full release You will hear people whine about bugs and other imperfections  let me say it again  it s an alpha Of all the alphas I ve played I ve never seen a development team be so quick to respond to criticism and fix the mentioned issues This game is extremely well crafted and needs only polishing With that being said buy it now before it doubles in price upon full release  Fair warning   for all of you CSGO or  CoD lovers prepare to either 1 learn patience and get good at a different style game or 2 cry about  camping  and a plethora of other tactics that relate to this game Battlegrounds is not about kills  it is about survival You can accept that adapt and enjoy the game  otherwise I look forward to reading your salty rants about how bad you are in forums or social mediaCheers,positive

First of all regarding the negative reviews due to the addition of microtransactios in gameFrom the PUBG Wiki  Proceeds from the sale of the keys to open the Gamescom Invitational Crate will be used    To provide funds needed to organize the event  To provide a prize pool for the invitational winners  To support a selection of charities So all the whining about how much money the dev s have made already is rendered moot On top of that all these items are like all the other items available through the existing non monetised reward system purely cosmetic with absolutely no effect on game mechanics If you don t want them don t buy them   it really is that simpleAlso EARLY ACCESS The devs can change the route to full release as they see fit Now the game I saw a couple of youtubers playing this and thought it was worth a punt at 26 Best PC money I ve spent since buying my 970The premise is not new as the Battle Royale mods have been around for the Arma games for ages I can t compare them however as I never played the mods If they were half as good as this though I missed a trick This game has become my go to title displacing everything else including Eve Online which I ve been playing since releaseFrom the moment the plane starts making its way across the map the tension starts and doesn t stop building throughout the match spiking at various times throughout Whether it s when you re tabbing across open ground feeling the itch between your shoulder blades from multiple  imagined sometimes real at others snipers lining up on you or when you are stalking someone seemingly oblivious to your presence as you loot a locale Don t get me started at what it feels like when you reach the top 10 and if you are goodlucky enough to get that chicken dinner it feels sublime  DIt s not perfect for sure but the key words here are  Early Access  with all that goes with it There are still issues with lag some desync and I ve had more crashes since the last patch than before BUUT the crashes always happen after a match not during The lag for me was never a massive problem no more than on BF4 BF1 or COD Whether this is down to my internet  currently BT Infinity 2 or my machine  which is no longer top flight I don t know I don t play in ultra settings on this game as my FPS dives but with the settings I use I get a decent frame rate  settings are a mix from very low on shadows to high on textures and ultra on anti aliasing   fps is 50 80 depending on locationOverall  If this game gets no better I have had more than my moneys worth out of it,positive
A breath of fresh air in the Shooter category  Well worth the money,positive
Just showing my disapproval for the developers  insert complaint about micro transactions I told myself I wouldn t buy another early access game but with 200k concurrent players 247 I went for it Game is fun developers are working on the wrong stuff,negative
great game make me so nervous and panic love it just need more upgrade like the item or the map to make people not boredbut overall its a gread game thx  3,positive
After 24 hours of playing I can safely say this is one of the best Battle Royale games I have played When you join a game you must jump from a plane land and gather supplies to stay alive and win the illusive  Chicken Dinner  The game has a lot of In Game Customisation You are able to attach sights and other gadgets to your weapons at any time and you can find armour and helmets to keep you from harm The vehicles are fun to drive around in but most of the time you will be driving away from the barrier that is slowly coming towards you The game keeps the match progressing by using the barrier like all battle royale games and if your lucky you can try grabbing loot from an airdrop but its a risky challengeThe game is at it s best when you are playing with friends in a squad match using teamwork and coordination to surviveTo wrap up this review I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the FPS genre and Battle Royale gamesGood luck And see you on the battlefieldCHICKEN DINNER FTW,positive

PUBG is truly a tactical  strategic and skill based battle royale game that no other game can replicate  Battlegrounds wastes no time putting player right in the middle of the action  as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km islandItem distribution is randomized  but players cant count on finding a good gun early keeping player safe  It isnt out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR L assault rifle  since good gear is only half the battle  the other half is wit As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse  those still standing are forced into ever closer proximity within the confines of a deadly ever shrinking force field until just one is left alive PS   Victory is an exhilarating reward  matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it  But even if you die early  jumping into a new game is always quick and easy Rate   710,positive

I had initially played this game on Nvidia s  GeForce Now  Beta on my 2010 Mac But now play it on my PC I have tried it through a streaming platform and an actual computer Here are my views This is the first time in almost ten years that I ve been excited about a FPS I used to play Halo CE when I was in High School and that game was LIT for it s time I believe this game has the potential to captivate the same crowd This game actually brought me back to the gaming scene I have been playing for a couple of months now we ll see where PUBG goes So far I am pretty happyaddicted with the game Although I can see how long time players can get a bit bored with it With the introduction of Event Modes and hopefully Codename Savage map the game will continue at a steady pace for me to stay interested I am happy to be participating during a time where the company seems to be making big moves Cons Although the game has been keeping it fresh I still find it a bit limiting I am not sure how PUBG will handle the Map Selection in the future if there ever will be  I am not suggesting there should be In the old days you would just select a server and join a game or simply hit random That s what this game should do instead This would fix most of the chief complaints BUT Unfortunately due to a highly critical community the developers seemed to have punished everyone instead Players would  Chicken Out  if they spawned in a lobby that had Weather or was the Miramar map This made the game too plain for my taste  the game at this point is a bit predictable for me Bring back rain and fog bring a dust storm to Miramar or something Night mode  anything  I like how challenging the game can be and the introduction to more elements would vastly increase the variety of outcomesI personally haven t had too many unpredictable optimizationbug issues At Least not much more than any normal game  I love finding glitches when I am casually playing a game I ve got a youtube channel devoted to it But an issue in PUBG is not good at all The game lends itself to completely terrible situations and its extremely competitive This isn t a great combination A simple reload animation might get you killedsometimes you get stuck when trying to landVehicles are a gamble One could also argue that this adds to the tension sure The term for this is getting PUBG dThe cheater issue is a real one I ve had a few games completely ruined by cheatershackers I am also not sure what PUBG can do about it I ve played alongside great players from around the world and I ve won on teams where we can barely communicate I can identify a few types of cheaters Farmers  they join team modes and AFK They end up jumping off the plane at the border of the map Since everyone is killing each other at School by the time the  Blue Zone  Kills them they ve survived and earned battle points They also earn battle points from YOUR WORK it s so unfortunate having a dud as a teammate This can all be fixed by killing people who don t get off the plane probably farming crates and selling them on steamHackers  This only happens to me on test servers question is why would anyone spend the time doing this go to a pubTeam Killers  This one is debatable Friendly fire adds to the realism sometimes your teammate needs to die faster so you can take their supplies so you kill them But other times people just shoot you for no reason or to take your gun It totally bums me out when that occurs but it s just a game I guessCrateLoot Box system  I like that it s all cosmetic and not pay to win It ends there I at this point could care less how my character looks The mystery boxkey system is pointless I have received the same thing too many times for me to even care about it Other games handle this perfectly you work towards the item you want to buy and there should be a tier that you could pay for if you wish In my experience the mystery box system is a disaster I would even pay the same price to just buy the exact item I want I am positive this would increase player inputcustomization I wear a grey shirt and black pants It s either the dumb stock look or waste my money on another striped shirt Pros This game was mythical when I first heard about it Everyone got curious and the game immediately became esoteric innovating a  new  genre of gaming I dropped off from playing many shooters the last one being Starwars Battlefront 2 which was itself critically received But I really played the hell out of Fallout 4 I feel that this game has a very close feel to the same looting satisfaction that I get from a Bethesda gameLooks amazing on my computer Again I tried it on GTX 1080i on ultra and GTX 1060 on low The difference was a bit noticeable yet marginal It looks great game is do able on either settings you should be able to win no matter what limitations dude The map in very detailed and every rocktreehillside can become a battlefield The game was highly considered with its placement of everything Again I m excited to see the two new mapsI truly enjoy the competitive nature of this game The rules are clear from the beginning and that brings a level of equity to the game It s fair if everyone plays fair but the game lends itself to unique strategies within its environment Your life is based on your strategic decisions But also you can drop into school and play a quick matchbecome principle You must play this game atleast once in your life maybe twice For 30 I ve had more fun than the last three 70 games I ve purchased It s totally a value I d get it just to own it In my opinion most gaming franchises became greedy in recent times Like COD or AC releasing a title every time I blink it s obvious what their goal is This has now led to an amazing era of gaming where Indie is king This game isn t perfect but it s worth more than the priceAside from that This game is unique no two matches are alike This game has the power to evoke emotions and cause moments of rage fear or compassion You embody your avatar and if you become good enough you can almost predict how long you will live I am impressed with how passionate the community can be I look forward to anything new the developers can bring to the tableSuggested Texts  Art of War Sun Tzu,positive

Really great game after the 10 update Servers are much better the maps are well designed guns are balanced the graphics as good as always and the performance is really improved now There might be a few hackers here and there but just give the game some time it just left Early Acces so it has time to get better and better I have high expectations from this game and I wish they are going to become true soon After all its totally worth it  EDIT1 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game dont buy waste of money   EDIT2  Still pretty good game and enjoyable mostly with friends     EDIT3  Broken game not worth it rn,negative

PUBG is areat idea that was overrun by hackers advertisers and gamblers The devs cashed out before the game even hit release 10It s an Early Access game It has many problems Fixing those should be top priority but instead the devs are working on adding loot gambling to the game via keys and crates Hit registration and server lag have been very spotty since release These are critical game components that make or break the game and should have been fixed on the first patchAccording to Steamspy the game sold around 5350000 copies so far that means after the 30  cut for Steam BlueHole made roughly 100 million dollars before taxes My guess is that s enough revenue to get this thing finished and improve the servers without needing to add gambling to the game Edit Because the dev team was so focused on trying to squeeze profits instead of listening to the community the game is now being ravaged by hackers If you play PUBG right now at least 50  of your games will end with a speek hacker wall hacker auto aim hacker ESP hacker and so on If BlueHole goes bust this will be a valuable lesson for the next big battle royale game maker Focus on the quality of your game and listen to your community before you milk them for profits,negative
The devs are absolute awesome compared to other games They listen to feedback push updates and new content really fast and are generally very open about upcoming stuffUPDATE 1  Changing the review to negative because this is no longer the case It feels like the developers have stopped giving the slightest LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about this game There s no more communication and the game feels horrible Especially the update to the body damage zones without adding penetration to body parts like the hand is just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE UPDATE 2  The communication especially on reddit has massively increased lately and suggestions are picked up and implemented into the game quite fast Great change of attitude towards the community However while the  last update was looking great on the test server they changed attachment stats and AR sprays in the last minute and threw the patch on live servers without further testing The games netcode is still absolute garbageThe game is fun overall and I love it but LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t is happening way too often,negative

For me it s a big No No After 250h you would think that I enjoy the game  hell no I enjoy the concept of it Everything else is a copy past of outsource modules that have been quickly blended in to amke a prototype And with the success of the game currently I lost all hope to see thise game beeing reworked to it s core to fixe thos massive core gameplay mechanic issuesAs Dev I can safely say that a massive portions uses marketplaces to build their game Most of the assets have been bought online with a quick pass of simplygon on top of it   hey guys Sympligon isn t supposed to be used that way  meaning a lot of Lods in the distance are completly incorrect and you can end up beeing able to see someone behind an invisible rock or having Houses without windows due to the low amount of polygon Sympligon cutted The weapon  ballistic is an unreal engine 4 plugin The outfit customization was made by a third party who sell it working as is out of the box The whole FPS system is likely to be the basic Unreal engine 4 FPS template once agian UE4 s crosshaires for weapons and grenades and since this engine wasn t made to accomadate such a large amount of players there is obviously a massive amount of lag input and hitreg and it s not entirely due to the Servers but because of the engine itself not being ablee to handle so many players at onceSo now the devs are asking Epic to fix this problem aherm excuse me  if the engine isn t working as intended it falls on you bluehole to rework the  core code and make it work Not epicI know this company doesn t have the talent to pull this out Hell even with the massive amount of money they got from this early access they simply won t be able to fix thos issuesYou will still have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  archaics and clunky gameplay mechanics full of imprecisions issues for the simple fact that   most of the work on this game is not theirs  I wish I could be refunded for the simple reason that after 5 months I have seen no significant changes on the core gameplay side of the game and most likely never will Their   transparency   is laughable compared to Cloud imperium Games and Star Citizen who have a video explaining everything every week With concrete work showcasedDon t buy this game  wait and see if they   REALLY  are going to fix the majors issuesCore gameplay should be polished by this time it s not the case with this game,negative

Network lag issues completely RUIN what would otherwise be a fun game Fix that before adding microtransactions to your game that s already made 150 million in sales  Which you also promised wouldn t be added until after EA______________________________________________________________Blue screened while I was loading once nice______________________________________________________________Saw a city being bombed from up on a hill thought it was cool so I went to take a screenshot through steam I hit F11 and suddenly the entire game goes black and I can t reopen it I can t even exit it without using task manager LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like this happens pretty much every other time I play where its unfixable and you can t even exit,negative

It is satisfiying getting headshots,positive
This is a simple fun and engaging game that never seems to get old especially with the devs constantly working on it Yes it has its issues but this is early access so it is kind of expected Oh and to the people complaining about the new pay options within the game they are purely cosmetic they do not affect game play in any way if you are looking at this game for a good time get it the pay options will not affect you in any way,positive
EDIT  servers are better and updates keep comingSo i ve been playing this game for awhile now and have played in solo squad and duo s and in playing those i had fun this game is fun However it runs horribly and has server lag out the wazoo Those two things make the game downright frsutrating and no matter which settings i change or reinstall the game nothing fixs it Once the game is better optimized and better servers are implemented it will be a knock out game,positive
Does not work after update,negative
this game is addicting af,positive
 we will not add micro transactions until the game is finished being developed  ya i guess bad optimization network lag and over all buggy gameplay like running yourself over with your car when you stop and jump out or getting shot by someone looking the other way or shooting someone with a shotgun and oops that didnt actually hit them sorry those 3 dead accurate shots into there body didnt want to register so have fun getting killed,negative

For the short amount of time that I have played this game I can definitely say it is worth every cent very fun if you have the patience and great to play with friends   quite demanding on ram and cpu usage so if you dont have atleast 16gb ram i dont reccomend playing or your fps will be quite unstableI am personally going to upgrade from 8gb to 16gb tomorrowand from i5 6500 to an i7 7700k just for this game i love it   gpu is 1060 6gb ,positive

27 doesn t buy you the game It buys you access to the game In that game you then buy more access for more content No it s not like Overwatch s system where you can actually earn the same things through playing There is literally content locked behind more money that you can not get despite having paid 27 for the  access to the game Such a bad moveThe game itself is pretty a pretty good 100 player skirmish where you can play in parties of 1 4 players There are still a lot of bugs though and the developer constantly pushes out buggy releases and hopes we deal with them Just recently he pushed out an update that lagged out the whole game until the players thinned out to a smaller number as the server for some reason couldn t deal with the load Let me emphasise this he purposely pushed an update that broke the game and he s done it several times normally with patches 2 weeks later But he did it and he did it to push out his micro transactions so they are on time with the real world event they are complementing  He also said he wouldn t push micro transactions in early access   but hey   popularity and money changes peopleAll in all if you re gonna get it you might as well make sure you have friends to play it with to make you forget about the screwed up stuff the developer is pulling,negative
No loot simulator,negative
GOOD GAMEWORTH THE MONEY,positive
Well I bought the game for a reasonable price giving the sheer quality of it however 1 minute after logging on I noticed the games graphics we on very low so I turned it up to high thinking It would look and run 10x better However it ran at 1fps so i turned off the game and looked at my graphics card and searched it up on the internet I payed a good 900 for it and bought a supposidley better quality graphics card for anouther 250 when I searched the graphics card up however I noticed I had on of the lowest end nVidia graphics cards and my pc had already been playing up so now I am going to buy a very expensive graphics card on the high end and a new pc because of the trouble this has put me in,positive
Fast looting great combat great gameplay and way  better than Dayz Yeah my friends it is PUBG I think the game is on beta state  higly recommend it ,positive
I would really love to play this game if it didn t crash every other game,negative
Good and nice game,positive
Calling it now everyone who don t recommend this game has yet to win PUBG,positive
I m tempted to write a list of things wrong with this game but I would hit the maximum number of lines allowed for the review so I ll just skip that and focus on trying to reconnect to the servers Lag was a major thing back in the days of Quake 2 and 3 and UT I can t believe that it s actually gotten worse and that these companies can take themselves seriously if they can t even address that issue But then again Steam was a huge pile of sh t when it came out and it still is No wonder they allow other sh t on their platform Anyway back to queueing,negative
This is my third favourite game ever It s hasn t been stale at all high quality weapon balance it s fair there s so much crap I like about this game I can t even list it allOnly thing I don t like about it is optimization I just built a new pc so I could play this game at more than a locked 12 fps  shows my dedication to the game doesn t it  But this is to be expected from an early acsess game and the dev team is actively trying to fix this,positive

If you don t have friends then auto match til you find respectable human beings to squad up with on a regular basisCongrats you now have friendsMake sure you have a headset and communicate wellDon t just use it to say something about how some country is rated highlyDon t transact on a micro scale if you don t wanna Just like IRL it doesn t matter what you look like it matters how well you execute your jobTremendous game getting better all the timefwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwsorry wrong window,positive
Fun  but unpolished IDC about cosmetic microtransactions Definitely not a game meant for lower end computers My mid end rig can just about handle it   50 70fps on a lower settingI see a lot of potential for this game however Devs sticking to a schedule is always nice,positive
One of the better early access games and just keeps getting better,positive
very fun game,positive
Really enjoying the game yes there are some optimisation issues but fiddling with the graphics settings helps People are whining about the micro transactions If you don t like them dont buy them Its not a complicated concept They have no benefit to gameplay other than changing the appearance of your characterThere is hours of fun to be had here and as its in early access it will hopefully only get better So I recommend this game Providing he micro transactions remain for cosmetic reasons only,positive
When you bail out of the plane I recommend that you spam the V button during your descent so that you can propel towards the ground at a faster speed thus being able to loot the buildings first The logic behind this is that since you are rapidly switching between third person and first person view it actually channels the air currents around your player and increases the KM per hour by 005  per press of the button It s hardly noticable but nonetheless very advantageous I ve tested this theory in game and I ve reached rank 100 in Squad mode every time due to being able to loot the crossbow before anyone else at the military base,positive
Concerning the micro transactions people are all getting upset about All the proceeds are split going to charity aswell as the gamescom prizepoolI dont see this as a bad thing and i certainly wouldnt give this extremely fun and addictive game a bad review because of it810,positive
It s fun but in the stick my tongue to an icy pole and the only fun part was the initial thought of sticking your tongue onto the pole only to realize once stuck that of course you were going to get stuck If you re into that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  go ahead and play this game like I do to myself,positive
get it or regret it,positive
 What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer Morty  The answer is  Don t think about it ,positive
Yes it s true There are going to be micro transactions However that doesn t mean anything They are all cosmetic items that don t effect the game at all You don t have to buy them to be good They will be there so that the community can show even more support for the awesome game that has been created Also the money will help the developers continue optimizing and refining to make the game even better1010 would spend 30 more on the game,positive

This a very fun game there never seems to be the same kind of match ever I haven t won one yet but I keep playing it is just so fun Most of these negative reviews are the people that seem to be complaining about the crates system that they brought into the game just now but they are cosmetic only The Devs always seem to be there with updates and working to keep the game stable When all said and done this is an Early Access game please don t be buying this game thinking that this is fully released there will be bugs that will come about but they won t be there for that long,positive

Anyone who has read anything about this crate situation please know that all income from key sales go to charity and to fund a tournament So not only are they helping out humanity which ya know most people don t they are using this as an opportunity to test crates before they officially release them after the games launch Which is a win win in my opinion There s no need to get so personally offended by a company who makes a game you like to the point of raising virtual pitchforks Take a step back and gain some perspective No one is out to get you or take advantage of you or force your money out of your wallet into the game developers pockets They are simply trying to make full use of this oppurtunity for more exposure fullscale testing and donating to a good cause I m sure they re fully aware how much money this game has made and will make with the key and crate system And yet they decided to share it with a charity That plus the ongoing support for this game they ve shown in every aspect from advertising to patches to acknowleding their mistakes and apologizing so openly has proven to me that this team is made up of decent human beings who actually care about the game they re making and the people who play it as well as the people unfortunate enough to not be able to playThank you for your timePS   Good luck with your never ending journey devs We all want this game to succeed Especially the ones so adamant against the crates otherwise why would they care so much    ,positive

Originally I had a positive review on this game but now I can not stand playing this game anymore Too many cheaters on their game It just does not stop Played 3 games in a row and died to a no recoil cheat that is clearly visible on replay Clearly the developers do not care about their community with handling cheaters Absolutely horrific game now ALSO FIX YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING NETCODE,negative
I really enjoy the game a LOT of un   I ve met great people I can play for hours and hours For this I believe the game deserves a positive review HOWEVER The downside The devs let me know they think im a chump by adding micro transaction BEFORE the game was out of EA which they promised they wouldn t Their answer to this was that  They had to test these things before the game was finished  Soyou can t let us test these for free and take them away when the game goes live  This CAN be  tested  for free the logic of  We need to sell these to people so that they are ready for people to buy  answer lets me know they think im a chumpThe NEXT answer we were given was that   Oh i mean its going to charity and the tournament  Well guess what I think we have already paid enough for you to afford your own tournament and your own charity donations SOthe bug hit me and I  regrettably bought keys and opened crates I now have 4 pairs of white school pants for boys  im not a boy   tired of boy clothes being the norm and 3 pairs of white sneakers THAT ARE NOT SELLABLE OR TRADEABLE You cant even sell it for BP s like normal items You re just stuck with 4 pairs of white school pants for boys Because the Dev s want ot be SURE you feel sick when you give them money Im starting to feel rage when i think of this game Im a chump Why did i buy these keys why did I feed into this   I wish I could have kept my positive review rating I have to change it I just have to I feel sick when I think about this game now Will I play it again  Probably the damage is already done they have my money I just wont recommend buying keys,positive

The trailer makes you expect a lot different experienceI can t say you ll be left with a disappointment but your expectations may not be metGive it a shotThe game can get really dull and frustrating at times Make sure to land at dense areas  player packed so that you actually have some firefight fun Don t be saving up all the loot like it s yours forever It ll be yours for 35 minutes max Just grab a gun grab a helmet engage in a firefight Don t be a sneaky snake and rush the enemies to practice the shooting in this game Then you ll actually have funEnjoy your purchase,positive

Here s my sort of in depth review of PUBG Gameplay  PUBG is a battle royale game were you alone or with friends take on a 100 player lobby with the aim being to come out on top There are a variety of guns including assault rifles sniper rifles pistols etc Some guns can be extremely overpowerved such as the AWM but guns like these can only be found in the air drops so are realatively rare Otherwise the game is heavily survival focused and has no craftingUI  meh it s not the best Rough and not very user friendly but hey what can you excpect from a early access game The UI constantly needs refreshing because features  ie friend statuses do not update automatically Community  well let s put it this way your not going to be talking with people in your game that arn t your teamated are you Sometimes other players have some  rather unfriendly  things to say to you if you kill them Other than that this game has one of the biggest player bases on steam with many guides videos and artwork being released everysayOther  BUGS BUGS EVERYWHERE I guess it is an early access game but some of these bugs can REALLY be gamebreaking especially vehicle clipping getting stuck between some random polygons and not being able to move prones being blocked by seemingly thin air spectate mode being unwatchable in first person The list goes on and on and there are countless posts online talking about them I know i ve had more than a few games frustratingly ruined by bugs Lately there have also been horrific server latency problem to the point where me and my friend were playing and got disconnected mid way through the match Apparently this problem is going to get fixed soon though I will edit this review when it doesCRATE SYSTEM UNLOCKED USING REAL MONEY YAY  say what you want about this feature by I just reckon bluehole should tread carefully where they re goingUoptimized Again ik it s an early acess game but seriously its nearly Ark SE levels of unoptimised  eugh ark You re gonna want a beast pc for this Otherwise you can excpect things like houses not loading in frame stuttering etc Seriously thoughTLDNR It s got so much potential as well as having an otherwise brilliant and fun concept but the game itself has so many bugs and it seems that every patch just makes the game even more buggyI ve had quite a few fun moments with this game but countless times has my joy been siphoned out by this early access title s flawsStay away from this game until it s finished or at least be cautiousUntil then I will leave this game with a negative reviewEDITI am nevertheless looking forward to the performance and gameplay improvements that the full release of this game  10 will bring,negative
lol deleted my last review because i finally after 200 hours i opened my eyes and realized that this game is just a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  cash grab Glad i didn t spend any money on crates There s so much wrong with this game but the fact that this game earned millions and was one of the most played games on steam by a mile yet the optimization is WORSE than it was on release pre alpha Which you know back then i accepted because it was pre alpha But now that it has been FULLY RELEASED for almost half a year and it is still in the state it is in right now really opened my eyesLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you bluehole game had really damn good shooting mechanics Weapons balancing is also a joke btw and so is the lootbox system  which they promised they wouldn t implement back in alpha,negative

The concept is great the game is not Not for players who hate multiplayer games in general Overhyped and repetitive,negative
It s a fun game but too many hackers ruining the game  It s a game about stealth and precision  When people are running around with ESP and aimbots it has a much bigger effect on the game than for a normal FPS While sometimes you re just unlucky sometimes it s clear what s happening  For example I m sitting in a house in the middle of a city  Squad drives up in a car straight to my house  They come up the stairs ignoring all the other closed doors open the one I m in and shoot meAnother example  Just now I was in the top 4  I was holed up in a house and had been for a while  Some guy runs up and he s scurrying around outside looking in windows I guess  I m on the second floor and I crawl around a bit trying to get a look at him using 3rd person camera  Whatever side of the house I crawl to he follows me outside  Finally I crawl out on a balcony and lay flat so he can t see me from the ground  He immediately comes around the house and stands  under  the balcony like he knows where I am exactly  I jump down behind him dump an Uzi clip into him and he one shots me at point blank range with an 8x scoped sniper rifle  Seriously WTF Now I m not saying everyone cheats  I play a good bit and I make the top 10  60  of the time  But there is almost always one guy in the top 10 who s hacking and either has and aimbot ESP or can shoot through walls and trees  It makes winning almost impossible  I have a 60  top 10 rate in solo and 4 man squad and like a 1  win rate in both  It makes zero senseUnless they fix the game I wouldn t buy it  It s got potential but it s no fun playing with hackers,negative
This game is sucks very laggy server,negative
Its a good fun game its just all the combat you love in a survival crafting game without the extremely boring and awful survival and crafting part Solo is just as fun and faster paced than teams and teams is still fun with friends However right now the updates seem to be pretty unoptimized Right now you pretty much need 16gb of RAM  If you dont youll get crazy stuttering and get put at a pretty bad disadvantage with as much attention as this game is getting I hope and expect these issues to be fixed fairly soon  I have a 1060 6gb with 16gb RAM and an i5 2500k 34ghz CPU and I still get micro stutters and FPS drops on ultra Before when I had 8gb of RAM If I had google chrome running in the background the models and textures of houses wouldnt load in for up to 2 minutes after landing on the ground PLUS stuttering on ultra You can imagine that it puts a player at a disadvantage After I upgraded this issue stopped but I still get FPS drops and micro stutteringAll this said I HIGHLY suggest you completely ignore the community Its all the internet arguing you could ever want with the awful twitch hivemind to add flavor  and frustration With little to no mic chatting in the game this is fairly easy to do though I wont get into the PR of the game and the controversies I have my own opinions on it but thats a discussion for the  Discussion  page and the forumsNOTE  I wrote this review before the paid loot crate update and Microtransactions Hopefully it wont change anything but if it does im sure youll hear about it before I even remember I wrote this review,positive

Extreme  performance issues not loading maps not loading menu a lot of disconnecs clunky mechanics lot of A bugsBut when its running its a good game that makes a lot of fun and usally it is running pretty solidIssues I encounter   random crashes  buildings not rendering properly  poor performance on round start  autoswitching the server game mode  suddenly no sound   game not starting properly  cant reconnect to rounds the just threw me out hit reg    SERVERS ARE BUSY   Extremly poor network performance lags high ping  suddenly being kicked out of the game and unable to reconnect  losing the ability to interact ingame with anything  cant  reconnect after timeoutIts incredible how clunky and unpolisched this game is Nothing absolutly nothing is working as it should for a succeslful game like thisThis review is only temporary so I ll update it every few weeks months,negative
Great Game ,positive
This game is heaps of fun and only getting better with each major monthly patch It s pretty sad that people have to ruin steam review ratings over microtransactions It s just the reality we live in if you want a game to have longevity there needs to be a constant flow of cash and the best way to do that is microtransactions They re cosmetic for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s sake you don t even have to buy them if you don t like them they don t affect gameplay It s a much better pay model than paid dlc or pay to win,positive
This is a great game but there is no reason to be making money through microtransactions at this point in early access especially after how many copies this games has sold A pink skirt just sold for 500 on the marketplace Remember CSGO LOTTO  well PUBG LOTTO will be a thing soon enough,negative

The Battle Royale mod from Arma made into a standalone and as clunky as DayZ  muddled textures poor lighting abysmal sound quality and now complete with dreadful FPS drops and performance and frequent network lagging It s UI4 engine but it runs like the in house Enfusion engine Just as many issues with server tick Don t anticipate most of the prominent issues with the game to ever truly be fixed as the devs are mostly focused on making this as attractive as possible for streamers  prime streamer bait to suck it dryTop that off with micro transactions for a pointedly UNFINISHED game and you have a recipe for an eternal EA cash grab,negative
People have their head up their asses The micro transactions that were added do not add any pay to win aspects to this game They re purely cosmetics and one needs to buy anything in this game to do well Yes the developer did say there would be no microtransactions in the game but that was before the game became a HUGE hit They are using the money from these microtransactions in order to fund tournaments for PUBG I see no evil in that People are also saying  they ve sold 4 million copies etc  and that s for the developers to keep the game running Yes the last patch was flaky but the developer was able to fix it withing 24 hours and send all hotfixes in order for the game to be playable People forget how hard Bluehole works in order to keep the game running well I will say it again people have their head up their asses They refuse to play a game that they bought  And usually played 100 hours because of the few issues that went on Flaky patch was fixed the micro transactions were explained and give players NO ADVANTAGE It s ridiculous how many bad reviews the game has gotten in the past 24 hours,positive
Brilliant game One of the most intense FPS experience I ve had in a long time I couldnt give a rats LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about micros transactions that make my model look different I dont have to buy and they dont give anyone an advantage As I only care about the experience the game offers I d highly recommend this even at this early access stage There are bugs and you need a decent rig to play it but if you are into FPS games this one is an absolute must,positive

Microtransactions for chests with lame loot ruins this game  We ve already paid for an early access scenario why monetise now when you ve got a game to finish ,negative
This is an amazing title If you love Battle Royale games or just having fun with your friends   this is the game for you The people compalaining about microtransactions are just poor LOVE LOVE LOVE  plebians   don t bother listening to them They re complaining about an optional cosmetic feature flashing clothing doesn t give you an advantage in fact it s does the opposite,positive
Negatives  Demanding hardware requirements hit reg is improved but still iffy parachute is still a death trap shotguns are still effectively useless unless they re literally inside the person you re shooting at armour feels a bit overpowered whether you re in it or shooting at it game feels like it got pushed into full release unfinishedPositives  Runs super smooth if you have the specs this is the closest thing we have to a functional BR game,negative
Great game every match is different it s smoother than most EA games it has it s bugs but what EA game doesn t One of the top EA games released in a long time imo,positive
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS though still in early access has been a wonderful and amazing gaming experience for me personally I am aware that not all others feel this way but this is my personal opinion There is never an uneventful moment in this game especially when you reach the top 10 and your heart is pumping faster than ever before The adrenaline kicks in and you experience a true  fight for your life  feeling that is hardly ever seen anywhere else Even though there are some bugs and glitches because the game is still fairly new this game is truly one to keep your eye on Recently many people have been leaving negative reviews because of the addition of the crate and key system They are angry because PLAYERUNKNOWN and the dev team promised  no micro transactions until the game s full release  The reason crates and keys were added was to serve as a  test run  for later additions Additionally some of the revenue from the crates goes towards charity the Gamescon Invitational PUBG prize pool and supporting the devs themselves Plus PLAYERUNKNOWN himself even gave a sincere apology to the community for doing this Most people overlook the reasons that this system was implemented and only think about the micro transactions If you actually realize why the dev team did this you would understand that they had to do this for many reasons But enough about that Looking at gameplay you definitely need a beefy computer to run this game well which is a downside but I can assure you that it is worth it for the beauty of the landscape alone Indeed the environment in this game does look very realistic and nice if you can run the game at high settings One thing that really makes this game stand out from others is the huge requirement of strategy If you don t have a game plan and aren t paying close attention to everything you will be steamrolled by the other players early on in the match If you plan ahead and move tactically you will succeed and make it further into the game Like I mentioned earlier the feeling you get when in the top 10 or higher is something truly unique to battle royale games especially this one Overall I would definitely recommend that you give this game a try even if you are a bit  on the fence  If you truly hate it just refund the game and be on your way You must remember that this game is still in early access and the devs need time to flush out all of the problems And with the monthly updates bringing new content and a new map coming in the future there is a lot to get excited for Thank you so much for reading this review even though it s kinda long,positive

Nice Game Its Just Nice Dont Force Me To Say More,positive
bad game more bug,negative
If you like to pay for an alpha release of a game go for it Today I played 2 hours and crashed to desktop 5 times died in game because of bugs 3 times For example I was on a motorcycle on a road and all of a sudden for no reason at all I get launched into the air then I fell to my deathI can t wait for a better alternative battle royale to be released because this one is so amateurish the only reason it s so popular it s because it s either this or frigging fortnite,negative
this game is awesome and worth the purchaseeven if there are few bugs the awesomeness of the game dissolves it alli really enjoyed this game playing with friends hope pubgcorp add more content overtime God bless PUBGeesus,positive
ruined the game by adding crates and skins making it unrealistic and unfair,negative

Very fun game to play with friends the new FPP mode is a great try Pros Great graphic appealing game Greatest Battle Royale out thereCons Lags all the time not optimized Network lag but it is getting fixed  Good for me most gamesConclusionWould be a great buy and I think I spent all 30 and It was worth itWouldDieToAPanAgain,positive
Updated   It s boring now,positive
I just can t imagine being a dev of an early access game and prioritizing the addition of micro transactions before squashing bugs and adding content,negative
Game is bad Can t find a match because matchmaking is broken They earned so much money but no funds to fix their game Dont buy this game play fortnite or some other br this game is not worth it,negative
This game though in early acess has been an extremely fun experience for me Even though there is a mass backlash for the microtransactions  which have no effect on the core gameplay I would reccomend this game to any battle royale type game fan or arma lover,positive
so you had to go and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up a great gamewhy would i spend any more money on your game if i cant even play itthe game lag at the start is unplayablecrashes every game,negative
Potatoes than ubisoft s servers,negative
Was expecting more performance out of this game oke its early acces  i get it but still despite that you spawn and you try find new guns every single time never find guns not fun at all i ll defiantly give this a try again when performance is fixed or when its out of early acces but for now i would suggest waitingI run 5820k  42 ghz and gtx 1080 both watercooled and heavily overclocked and still ran like crap game felt like it was hitching quite a lot and 60 fps felt more like 20 fps,negative
THE LAG IS REAL,negative
The game is amazing and you can find plenty of reviews going into detail Just don t let people scare you off with the recent reviews yes you can pay for one of the three crates Two of them are free and sell for 25 on the market at the moment so if you feel like you can t afford to buy crates for money sell crates then buy moreMost fun I ve had in a video game in the past 3 years,positive
Pan saved my life multipul times,positive

After removing the new anti cheat system the game become full of cheaters Almost in every match i get killed by cheater in last 2 weeks DO NOT BUY until they fix it WASTE OF MONEY I dont think they care anymore because they are busy with mobile version loot boxes and skins They wont care couse they already earned the money they want Still has lots of optimization problems and leader board keeps resetting and game crushes are the sauce for this mess,negative
very fun but many hackers,positive
i love this game with all of my heart but they re adding microtransactions instead of fixing the problems they have right now which is just gonna make more problems and it s just gonna get worse and this is just getting dissapointing when they started to work on the optimization i was getting a lot better frames but now it s just getting worse and tbh the game just isn t fun anymore if you don t have a good enough PC i wouldn t buy this right now   ,negative

dont worry about all the microtransaction complaints of course i much rather there be a mix of paid and free crates but other than the completely optional thing this game is really great and fun and always updating with bug fixes small changes and added weapons and the creator does very much so listen to the community,positive
I ll y all on Fortnite,negative
I do not reccomend supporting this developer because they plan on being greedy and anti consumer even more than they are with this pay to open crate by removing all free to open crates in a game that we pay 30 to play,negative
My first impression say this game is a lot of fun and very goodWhat it needs tho is optimazation I dont have a great computer but i still got it running at 60 fps but eveyrthing looks LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  It also crashes a lot for me idk why,positive

well um this game was fun until its most recent update imagine your self trying to walk up the stairs you make it to the top then magicly  lag spike you teleport to the bottem step repeat for 30 45min get shot restart pls fix i love this gameOne more thing FIX THE F   ING BUILDINGS its impossible yo do anything when you land and non of your buildings have fully loaded in and your getting masive frame drop i normaly get around 60 80fps but when my buildings dont load in which is 99  of the time i cant do anything for the first 2 3 min meaning i either drop where there is no loot and maybe survive or drop somewhere with loot and hope to god that the buildings will load before someone finds me this bug is making the game unplayable for me i get so mad so fast at it and if i die well they arnt loaded my computer crashes for 30 min i am above the minimum specs for the game even thoughit says it only needs 6gb of ram in some cases like mine apparently you need 16 just to load in the buildings for now until i see improvement in my buildings loading i do not recomend this game i will continue to play the game just know that because of this glitch my blood pressure rises,negative
fun needs work,positive
Great game Toxic community but isn t that really to be expected in a game like this If you enjoyed DayZ but hated the bugginess of the game then you will enjoy this gameDon t expect a run and gun here this game is pure campfest That being said it still moves quickly the mechanics of the game be sure of that An average game will last you 25ish minutes if you re doing well It s rare that you ll go more than 40 minutes even if you winIt has it s fair share of problems to be sure but the highs outweigh the lowsThat being said they do occasionally run into issues for a day or two which is to be expected of a game that isn t released yet We re a giant beta test group and they re learning from what happens and listening to the community More than can be said of a lot of gamesEasily worth 30 bucks,positive
TBH i gave it a try landed in top 1500 EU solo and have to say that this game really has no progress at all and the development team is like development aid for third world countries uselessAlso i hope your f   ing company goes bankrupt and that all of your childeren have to pay up for it the next 60 years you greedy f   s,negative
newest update broke the game super laggy first person was rushed and now it screwed the whole game up super jumpy,negative
Amazing game Gets your heart racing,positive
Too bad PUBG is too busy filing bogus lawsuits because they are mad their game is subpar They could have spent that time making their game better If PUBG thinks suing Epic games is justifiable then Koushun Takami  author of the battle royale novel should sue PUBG for stealing his concept Have fun PUBG with your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game while every other company swoops in and blows you guys out of the water BAI ,negative
Don t let any  hype  for this game fool you if there is any anymore It s nothing more than a glorified walking simulator 50  of my matches are either dying withing thirty seconds of landing and the other half is walking around for twenty minutes and being shot in the back by a sniper Nothing about this game is fun I tried it way back when it first released and in the past few days tried to pick it back up to see if the bugs were fixed A lot of the bugs seemed to be fixed but this game is far from fun Definently not worth playing,negative
Good game wish they fix all bug someday,positive
NICE GAMEI BUY IT AND I PLAY IT FOR 15 MINUTE I VERY FUN,positive
I dont quite understand why this game has been getting such poor reviews lately gameplay I feel has improved for sure since last large update Really its one of the few games i have always come back to and is definitely the game I have been playing the most over the past year since release Personally I highly recommend,positive
to much thing what creator must fix  first  isto many texture failed  you run or drive and bugged in texture   ground  house  trees then  very bad driving   and too much time you die with car bugged in rock or somewhere about motorcicle driving i dont talking  its terrible  the savest car is van  its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t  but true  this game dont diserved that money,negative

Promised not to add microtransactions until after release Added microtransactions before release Fun game but untrustworthy development,negative
meh game had potential but the devs and owner completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed the pooch on this one,negative
I get this game is still early accesss but it still has so many server issues bugs and UI issues that it is disturbing they would spend more time on testing micro transactions then debugging and optimizing content i love this game but i also hate it and without them focusing more on game issues i could not reconment it at this timeFollowing is just one  of my bug postsI have around 100 hours on PUBG now and I have had great things to say about the game and some not so great things Since my first install i have never been able to buy loot crates with battle points leaving my character naked with an empty inventory  wardrobe screen I am also unable to change my characters appearance leading the accumulation of somewhere just over 25000 battle points Much to my disappointment after the patch near 832017 all of my battle points are missing now and i am UNABLE TO EARN MORE from matches i play now This is unacceptable and will be what breaks me from playing this game I have reinstalled the game more than once and appears to be a bug attached to my account i have posted about this in the past and would love to hear ANYTHING from anyone with information I would no longer be able to recommend this game in the state it is in being there are still many issues with the game yet they want to push micro transactions into an already unfinished game,negative
It s fun and challenging for both you and your pc,positive
This is not a game it battle royal,positive
If a giant last man standing game is your thing This is pretty fun Don t mind the butthurt kids thumbbing down a game because they can t afford to buy a tshirt for 010Cosmetic crates are great and keep the game fresh with new outfits the easist of microtransactionsPlus this game has only been out for 4 months And its in Alpha,positive
The game is fun but still has a lot of areas to improve on Optimization has been improved since the time it was released Looking forward to more maps and weapons,positive
WELP They said that only paid content was coming after the full release and yet here we are with microtranactions in the lastest update  Honestly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing pathetic when this game has terrible 3rd and 1st person it is not optimized well and many other assortment of bugs and issues that have yet to be taken care of  Thank you gaming industry for forcing this microtransaction meta that forms around some of the most popular games,negative
Is this CS GO 2017 ,negative
Oh no They added optional cosmetics that you can pay for that make you MORE visibleYou see I m what you call an  adult  one who doesn t care if they add optional cosmetics for a small amount of money while CS GO does the same thing and people not only eat it up but illegially bet over it,positive
you server suckkkkktoo much lagging after updatepoor server cant play fully in game because too much lagginggrrrrrrrrr,positive
Best Battle Royale style game on the market as of August 2017   Recommended for anyone who enjoys shooting looting running and dieing  Hide and seek with guns where s waldo take your pick  Additionally this game is great to watch people play on twitchtv  it is riddle with insane lows and intense highs making it a great background show,positive
since the new update pubg isnt playable for me anymore waay to many lag spikes fram drops the building need 33mins to load always played 90 fps now its 3040 and not playable i reccomend not buying it untill they fixxed everything and the micro transactions are gonna ruin this game,negative

Playerunknowns BattlegroundsThe decision to open my wallet and board that plane for the first time was one of zero regretsThis is hands down the best multiplayer experience of last year If I would exclude Rocket League I havent been this excited when starting a match since Call of Duty  Modern Warfare PUBG breathes new life into a stale and predicting genre that often is most innovative in its modding sceneThe start of the match is always the same boarding that plane Its loud and I grip my mouse firmlyI am excited the games can be unpredictable and crazy things happen on a regular basis even more so when playing in a team of friends Taking loot ratio and player density into account I chose my destination on the huge map and jump I free jump and plummet to the ground the wind noise is numbing and in the corner of my eye I see my wife talking to me from the kitchen thinking I can hear anything at all The last stretch is reserved for a parachute glide Scanning my surroundings for enemies and possible an escape car From the moment my feet touch the ground I am in a state of fear and adrenaline will drive most of my actions for the next 20 30min Minutes later what seems like hours I lay covered in a wheatfield There are only three of us now three seasoned veterans who survived 97 other people Some were run over one had his head burst open from a frying pan others died of explosions a few fell to their deaths fleeing but most where just unlucky in the wrong place at the wrong time With heartbeats raised we sneak closer to eachother as the lethal force field that kept the match going closes itself further making the zone even smaller Suddenly I hear them exchanging lead not far from me I take a risk I stand up I put my M4 rifle to my shoulder As one of them falls to the ground the other stands exposed like a tree in the middle of the field In what seems like a cloudy dream I aim for his helmet and press the trigger He falls unexpectedly fast to the ground and I am greeted with a chicken dinner at last I burst out in a warcry My wife is effortlessly trying to tell me to not scream like that her words do not touch me My hands are still shaking as the emotions flush over mePlayerunknowns Battlegrounds is a game that you cannot miss you just cant,positive
CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH It does not matter how good your PC You will always CRASH,negative
I really love the game but every update seems to make it run worse I ve gone from running on Ultra and never having problems to running on medium and failing to load into 1 in every 3 games or so Then once I do load in the buildings look like blobs half the time I really wish this wasn t the case but the game is basically unplayable for me after the last update,negative
Before updating FPS  80 120 After updating  15 20   really    Don t ask for my PC spec mine can run your family over 150FPS at Ultra  P  PPs  dont buy this game till the Devs can  ACTUALLY  finish this sh    t ,negative

You were supposed to be diffrent You who put other early acess games to shame But now look at you You have not even finished the game left it poorly optomized and are already adding micro transactionwtf Shame on you But overall its a decent game,negative
Horrible game all the hitboxes are broken and as soon as you get good gear the game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s you off with some network lagg detected LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t Another reason why this game is horrible is because you can get killed by some hacking virgin scum who snipes you with a pistol across the map Also i got stuck in a glitch when i could not look up down left or right so i died by the barrier instantly Would recommend if you want to test if your uninstall button works properlyPS  I am writing this because I am stuck in a frozen screen as a result of network lagg detected and the whole server gets the lagg becuase the game is so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
Micro Transactions Poor Update performance,negative

This game is way too glitchy theyve really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed it up i mean i forund a glitch where cars make so soundAlso when im lagging  even though i can clearly see people movinf fine it locks your controls and if you get unlucky you end up dying by the zone your constanty running away fromtrailers are misleading its nothing like them mainly just a running simulator Wait until the game is acrually fixed cause in this newest update they truly ruined it,negative
Game is still crashing and there is lag with the new update Didn t have an issue before this,positive
Great game But PlayerUnknown himself seems like a little cry baby gameplay 1010 tho,positive
People are acting like this game is the pinnacle of perfection It maybe the best of its type but there aren t very many battle royale games to begin with so that isn t a good point Being bad but the best of something doesn t mean it is good It just means it is the best choice out of a small pool of bad choices The game does have the potential to be a lot of fun if the developers stop making questionable decisions in regards to both game additions and keeping promisesPeople are more upset by the fact that the developers lied than the fact that the crates exist as they were always going to be a thing when the game actually launched out of early access They are very inconsistent about exactly how much is going to charity and the tournament fund Regardless of them having more than enough to fund both themselvesOnly a portion of the profits from the crates are going to charity and the tournament if you bother to read the text They don t say how big that portion is and every sale of an item or crate on the Steam Market gives them even more moneyFrom the in game text when you choose to open a crate   Partial proceeds of key sales go to charities and Gamescom prize pool The announcement made it sound like 100  of the profits were going to those and many of the people defending their actions still seem to think so People seem to not understand it s not the existence of micro transactions but that they outright lied to everyoneI don t even understand how they are going to have a serious tournament when the game has random loot drops plane trajectory vehicle spawns plane crate drops circle location etc Competitive games need to have more consistency between teams to be taken seriously The game also suffers from server lag and various other issues Hosting a tournament for an early access game with RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG is bafflingPeople need to stop defending shady business practices just because they like the game I am glad you like it but that doesn t change the facts With the amount of money they are making off this game they need to invest in more staff so the game can actually be made properly The game still has a lot of game play issues and it is debatable if they are good enough developers to actually provide the product everyone wantsAccepting the fact that they just outright lie to their customers is a dangerous thing and sends a message to them and other developers that people will just willingly deal with it People supporting or defending this action in any way are setting a dangerous precedent for the future of what customers will stand forThe industry is terrible about releasing broken games that aren t ready for release day one dlc and season passes no patches after release  NieR Automata Deadly Premonition Dark Souls tons of unfinished early access games etc Gaming maybe more popular and accepted in culture than it used to be but it isn t in a good state so people should at least attempt to make a stand against developers that don t keep their word when the game has already made a ton of money and hasn t even released on consoles yetWhile I don t think this whole micro transaction controversy should be a complete deal breaker  I also don t think it should just be brushed aside and actually defended by some people because they are so blinded by the state of the gaming industry or so enamored with the game Nearing closer to the actual 10 release the game still has many issues it needs to fix,negative
The game is awesome with no controller When I heard they were adding controller compatibility I was very excited Then I played PUBG with a controllerEverything is very sensitiveIt is only available in first person view Still haven t figured out how to run and when you are running and turn slighty it basically stops running and it tried to side stepWhen using a sight or zoomed in for aiming it is VERY sensitiveThe game is still one of my favorites but for now I will not be playing with a controller,positive
The new update patch just ruin this game I literally can not play this game when my framerate drop from 40 50 to just 20 30,negative

Back when the game was Early Access I had a lot of fun and wrote a possitive review about itBut lately with it s official launch and having found nothing but hackers and cheaters being a constant in the game I have to change my positive review to a Negative oneFirst the PROS The game still has some fun to it dropping in finding gear to hunt down other players  either solo or a team  The game is always an adrenaline rush from the start  This is not your typical CoD Arena fighting  So you either play smart or get shotThe CON Sadly teh CONs have grown a great deal since the game release  The biggest ongoing issue with the game are the hackers and the cheaters  No surprise the majority of which are the Chinese  I realize it may sound stereo typing and racial  But the fact is they are Chinese hackerscheaters  Just in January  2018 the devs banned 100k players for cheating the majority of which were Chinese  But even that is not enough to save the game sadly  There are still hacks going on with cheaters using Snap to Target No Recoil Health Regen and Instant Kill ShotsEven though there are Death Cams to see who and how the player took you out  you can still report the player if you suspect they re cheating  But sadly the majority is always going to be a cheater  I have had maybe 1  2 legit players take me out but I encounter them once a month  Final Thought  I know in the past I said this is a  must Buy   But now with the state of it with hackers cheaters and slow responses from the devs on handling and controlling the problem  I have to say PASS  Though the new updates are nice on maps and new gear  it s not enough too deal with the weed regrowth of incoming hackers and cheating trolls,negative
Great early access game with consistent and constant improvements and great communication from the devs There is a lot of negative reviews regarding  micro transactions  and  crate and key  for cosmetics You know you don t have to have cosmetics right Edit  since logging in I feel that I should clarify the crate systemThere is 3 crates all of which can be  bought  using in game points which are earned from playing Only one of these requires a key to open If you don t want to open the crate you can sell on the steam market So you can make back some money on this game  It s a shame that the majority of negative reviews are purely reactive to either misinformation or lack of information or on the basis that some people don t like to continue to invest money into a game And whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion the decision to play a game should not rest solely on an optional feature which has no impact on gameplayI recommend this game,positive
Loot for 30 min die 10 min later,positive
This is probably the best game ever created It is well designed and has an amazing concept and its going on a very amazing track early access and all This game would probably give you either unconditional love or hate for it and will make you triggered easliy,positive
In my opinion one of the most over hyped games of all time Gameplay is beyond repetitive and development is in my opinion extremely slow In its current state I don t think this game is worth 30 maybe my opinion will change one day but right now I can t recommend it,negative
Needs a lot more work on optimising it before it will be worth playingI have a GeForce 1070 8GB RAM i7 CPU  400GHz I can run games like DOOM Dishonored 2 and AC Syndicate on Ultra and this basic looking game can barely run at very low GFX settings,negative
Microtransactions during EA is a big no no Devs can t be trusted,negative

Potential to be a good game but right now it sucks,negative
The microtransaction is a jokeMost of the items in the new crates are old items and i m pretty sure no one even wants themMoreover opening the crate always gives you the most common items i opened like 45 of them crates what did i get3x   Velcro trainers1x   Orange shirtand that is about it i would recommend to not buy the gamerscon crate and to spend money to buy a key for itCause as you see you ll almost guarenteed get a trashy double or even a triple,negative

Here s probably the most balanced review of the game so farPros 1 The core game is there There isn t any major flaws to the gameplay or core concepts2 It s only 30 Yes it is an early access title but with the consistent updates as of now it isn t bad  On a personal note it s not one of my favorite games but it s still a good game and I will continue to play it3 New content is announced monthly 4 The developer seems to care about the well being of the gamePros Summary There is no major issues to the game as of now and it s a perfectly fine game by today s standardsCons 1 There are SOME minor connection issues and lag HOWEVER do not listen to these people claiming to  have decent internet and I shot him in the head twice  I have 8Mbs internet not bytes but bits So I have slow internet Technically speaking I shouldn t be able to watch 1080p videos on Youtube BUT THE GAME IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR ME I have however had a few instances where things shouldn t have happened  example  getting shot while it appeared I was behind a wall or shots not registering but it is debatable as to whether or not it was the server or my internet Otherwise there s no lag with opening doors getting into vehicles or picking up items as other have stated on other reviews2 Only one map While the map is large it feels very empty Two new maps have been announced but it sounds like they won t be released until the game is officially released3 Poor optimization My computer is close to high end Not really but I can run ARMA3 on ultra graphics with a fairly stable 40fps PUBG on medium low graphics also grants me 40fps4 THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING COMMUNITY Everyone is a whiny little snot bag who can t read The current fiasco as of writing this is about the new crates for unlocking COSMETIC items Of the three new crates one requires you to purchase a key for 250USD in addition to spending in game BP  Battle Points to buy the crate Now the complaint people have right now about this is the developer PLAYERUNKNOWN said that no microtransactions with be in the game until the full release So these whiny little snot bags I mentioned yea they didn t read the developer s clearly written out statement about the new crates PLAYERUNKNOWN said  Proceeds from the sale of the keys to open the Gamescom Invitational Crate will be used  to provide funds needed to organize the event to provide a prize pool for the invitational winners to support a selection of charities Apparently no one LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing read that part and assumed the  godsend game developer  turned rogue all of a sudden for a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cash grab I choose to believe that they are staying true to this statement and honestly they could take a little bit of the money and I d be okay with that too Remember they are simply COSMETIC items That and everyone seems to care about their  rank  which will guaranteed be wiped at the full release as it is already wiped every month Whiny snot bags  I only used this phrase because I didn t want my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bleeped out   Sidenote to the crate stuff  I feel people have way to much BP as of now so instead of wiping the BP at release I think it was a good call to introduce more crates to get people to spend some of it Give them something to earn and unlock Instead of useless rank   Cons Summary It s an early access game with the expected amount of bugs and glitches and server issues like every other game out there But because people don t understand game development they assume that  since they sold like 4 million copies they should have enough money to fix everything  The community isn t nearly as trash as MOBA s are but it s not far off Also the developer needs to grow a pair and not apologize for this crate fiasco He did nothing wrongGeneral Summary It s a good game Try it or watch stuff on youtube or twitch If you re interested definitely get it Not entirely sure on the monthly thing My friends made it sound monthly I just don t follow it that much,positive
Very worth it to buy i really recommend this game one of the cheapest and yet has a continious updates and patches two thumbs up,positive
Great gamefun and great game to take the time,positive
 network lag detected I ll take back my negative review until fix,negative
Although buggy i have to be honest it s one of the best games in the last 5 yearsDevelopers are active so you know it s not a dead game with no future Constant updates and new content I highly reccomend it to people that want to tryhard or just for a fun time in general with friendsGo heat up the stove and get ready for Chicken Dinners,positive
It s called Player Unknown because everyone is camping with an x8 scope and you have to try and find them while dodging gun fire,positive
ITS FREAKING LAGGY NOW THE NEW UPDATE      PLS TRY TO FIX IT ASAP,positive
This game is just awsome This is not like H1Z1 evan troug it is a battle royal game there is alot of difrense between the games Do keep in mind that this is still early acsees so there are some problems whit the game like lag spikes and fps drops other then that i can only tell that you will get adicted to this game  ,positive

Look this is my reviewand there is 60 FPS when u looking at my review,negative
The game is brilliant very good for a open beta The only problem is my game takes 10 minutes sometimes just to get passed the  loading battlegrounds  screen I have the game installed to a SSD so there is no reason it should take this long to load Every time i log into the game it takes forever,positive
The most fun and addictive game i have played in a long time since i live in Pakistan and i am forced to play europian servers Order than that the game is improving day by day as it is in a developing phase and i cant complain about anything since i havent seen anything game breaking in 200 plus hours i have played this gameI really like this game and would suggest others who mostly play shooters to try this game,positive
Micro transactions in an early access game Nice one,negative
Recent patch considerably worsened the performance of the game even though it was supposed to optimize it I ve had to put all my settings to very low and even so I ve got lagging on a level I ve never before encountered on this game Adding microtransactions to an already very expensive early access game after they promised not to do precisely thatwell that might be seen as a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  move But it s steps backwards like how the game actually plays worse after the patch that s the stuff that makes me want to not recommend this game to anyone elseOn the whole this game has a lot of potential It s a damn shame its developersproducers are dropping the ballEDIT  Thanks to the new optimized vehicle physics now I can roll over my motorcycle without taking any damage What the ,negative
i have  played  this game for 7 hours but i havent even played the game yet whenever i go to play matchmaking it just freezes forever at the splash screen the 7 hours are just me countlessly trying to fix the bug  loooking up youtube on how to fix i thought it was just a small bug that would not happen the next time i tried but every single time ive tried to GODAMN try to play the GODAMN game it has frozen the only way to get out of the frozen screen is to restart computer i know it early access but if you are going to release an early acces game atleast make it playable ive tried every solution if you search up the error on youtube you can clearly see other people are having this problem just like me EVEN WORSE IS THAT IVE REQUESTED FOR A REFUND BUT THEY SAY IT HAS TO BE 2 HOURS OR LESS TO REFUND SO I BASICALLY GOT ROBBED FOR 30 BUCKS please fix this godamn bug please for the love of god ive seen gameplay and it looks extremely fun but i cant even play itplease fix gam pliz PLEASE  P L L EA SE FICKS THIS GAME PLEASE NOTICE THIS AND FIC X ITTTT,negative
I bought this game this morning and somehow managed to play 40 something hours of it by evening,positive
It s a nice game although there are some problems when loading the map texture maybe because it s still early access Overall i say it s a good game to play either alone or with your friends,positive
So this review is as of 822017So as of now pubg is in update month 4 and the new update is about to come out and it is going to be adding fov sliders first person only servers and crates1  Crates   so people are starting to get a little mad about the micro transactions that are coming with the crates so what I heard is the keys are going to be 3 bucks or someting but that is only for some of the crates there are going to be free crates also and all thats in the crates are cosmetic items and they saidi they want to use the money for esports and I think I would be happy paying them some money for that and dont forget they are patching it every week and adding new content every month so I think people should really stop complaining 2 The current state of the game        Ok so as of now there 4 snipers  1 map    3 Helmets  3 Vests  3 Backpacks                                                                                                  4 ARS                                                                                                  4 MGs                                                                                                  3 Shotguns                                                                                                  4 PistolsAnd lots of attachments,positive
plz fix the gas op aftravels too fast compared to how the games pace is I have multiple games where i have kills winning all of my fights and then the gass is there to kill me good game tho,positive
For now one of the most fun games i ve played really nice but still a lot bugs to fix and the weapon skins are garbage for now,positive
I love this game and I hate it so much The concept is great and I enjoy most of the gameplay But seriously I have no idea what the devs are thinking 95  of the time The optimization is trash Hot steaming trash There are bugs oh my god are there bugs I ll parachute out of the sky and land on flat tar but somehow take falling damage You ll be driving down the road on a motorcycle and then instantly get shot 100 feet into the air doing flips until you land on your head Instead of fixing these blatant issues the devs are more concerned with implementing gun skins and game modes that are for third person perspective A turd is still a turd no matter how much you shine it Fix the game then add the fancy crap I would quit this game so fast if it wasn t so fun,positive
Everything about this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  never buy this game,negative
Horribe Waste of money and Time play fortnite better and Free,negative
no if u have bad pcmy game crashes when match found,negative
Good Game Terrible bugs,positive
the game is VERY good sometimes there goes about 20 min before any action but does that mean it is a boring game  well try it yourself warning if you love survival you will get addicted to the gameand soon a new map this is crazy,positive
This game gives me hope that there still is a chance for Early Access games,positive
Early access is bad idea almost every time Pay for games that already exist I kind of want a refund but I know steam isn t great about that Long story short the whole premise of the game revolves around a janky fps experience If you want realism play arma 3 If you want arcadey fun play cs go This middle of the road bs doesn t pay off You think it may be the best of both worlds but it s the absolute worst For 30 better off visiting a cheap asian masseuse and eatting a nice small meal You ll feel like a king for about half an hour instead of feeling like complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for countless hours just to get rewarded with another off white shirt or discount oaklies in the loot crates,negative
To me this game is about looting stuff for 10 minutes then gifting it to someone else after being shot from 4 directions at once Recommendable,positive
This games is alot of fun whether playing solo or with friends in a duo match or squad If you are looking for a game that gives you an adrenaline rush when in a firefight or when its down to the wire in the final 5 left alive and low on ammo and meds and are starving for a win Then I would Highly recommend this game The weapon handling mechanics are clean and feel responsive the attachment choices for the weapon are a major plus to the game allowing for close and long range engagements And you never know whats going to happen each match or who you ll come up against Once you win your first game and see those infamous words  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  you will be hardpressed to find another game that you will want to play more than this one,positive

I have enjoyed playing this game until recently when the developers seem more focused on releasing new  weapons vehicles and crates without properly stabilizing gameplay in several serious areas There are numorous bugs and errors that occur regularly with no mention in weekly or even monthly updates This game has the potential to be great but it will fall to the same issues as H1Z1 if the dev team fail to realise that game balance and clientside stability are paramount over new features I feel let down with the sheer amount of supportinvestment the community has shown for this game with contextually few results,negative
First off let me start by saying this is most certainly a survival game not a competitive Battlefield or Call of Duty  you re welcome 9 year oldsThis game is survival of the fittest From the minute you jump out of the plane it s every person for themselves until the last one is standing You will die a lotNow then as for what I like I really like the DOTALOL style starting where everyone starts with nothing and you get your stuff as you progress the island It helps provide an equal playing ground I also like that there is no pay to win  at least as of right now  knock on wood  All the weapons are fairly balanced with each one having its pros and cons and attachments are everywhere to help you make your weapon a true forceAs for what I dislike dying Now hear me out I hate it because when you die your only choice is to return to the menu and start another match This is annoying because I feel from the game to the menu to matchmaking and back into another lobby takes so long especially for those who may have died at the starting gun I feel as though there could be an option to immediately jump to another server upon death to speed up the process  perhaps in a future update pretty please Another dislike is purely personal opinion but the campers are a littleridiculous For a game where it s one life and campers can nail you with two bullets you ll find a lot of people hiding behind doors with shotguns or ARs ready to spray you down A little cheap but as I said personal opinionOverall I give this game a thumbs up It has amazing potential and I keep coming back for more Stay away from the microtransactions and I think you ll find this game is a good time killer,positive
We need Helicopters,positive
Fantastic game and a must have,positive
It s pretty good,positive
I am approaching 420 hours of time played and I only paid 30 for the game This game is truly fun and very addicting The way you play the game changes depending on what match type you choose such as solo duo or squad All game modes are equally as fun and frustrating sometimes Today Bluehole released a first person only mode which makes the game feel completely new I prefer the third person mode for a more challenging experience in its own way but the first person only mode is definitely a nice change up If you are looking for a strategic shooter this is your game Highly recommend trying it out Arma Vets MUST try this game Lastly Bluehole has been very diligent with their patches updates and new content is constantly being releasedEdit Jan 19th 2018Final thoughtsFirst person only Third person is bab mode,positive
Soooo I ve got a few hours into this game now I feel like I can review it First off I do recommend this game A lot of people are saying no because they are upset that the dev added micro transactions But I personally don t care because if you actually care about what your person looks like in the game that s kinda silly because it s really only you who will ever actually know what you look like because combat happens very fast in close quarters or at range where you can t tell if the person has black or brown fingerless glovesAnywayThe game itself is very fun and very addictive Every match is different because every match everyone starts from scratch Scavange new guns clothes etc I ve had matches where I need to search 4 buildings just to get a handgun with some extra rounds and others I ve dropped onto a house that had everything i could possibly needI ve had multiple rounds now that I ve made it to top 10 and 1 match where I came in 2nd Let me tell you you ve never been more dissapointed for coming in 2nd place in your life You fight you survive all this time and with the playable field getting smaller just to get it stripped away last secondThere are some down sides controls can be a little clunky and sometimes picking up items can be a pain if they re too close to each other on the floor But overall for an early access game I ve been very surprised at the overall qualityas it is right now I d give it an 810 It s an extremely fun game but it does have some flaws that keep it from being astounding However those will likely be addressed at some point between now and official release,positive
love the game just wish my pc could handle it better XD,positive
AwSomE Game   After playing Opposing Force and CounterStrike for about 18 yearsI highly recomend this gameGreat work PlayersUnknown s and looking forward to the future progress,positive
thx,positive
I wish this game was awesome but it has a long way to go It s still very unpolished and has clunky game play,negative
Constant updates active devs that genuinely care for the game and community almost never get s dull with the randomness of it Actually makes me happy about purchasing something pre release for a change unlike a majority of triple A games all for a price that won t kill me Yeah there are still bugs and other issues with the game but I know with this dev team it will all be fixed with time Keep up the good work guys,positive
This game is a thrill to play  There is some optimization bugs  Namely memory leaks  But it is early access  The game is a lot fun to play with buddies  If you love a tasty finger lick n chicken dinner  Then this game us for you,positive
So many bugs for 10 china players with 1000 ping and bad devs This could be a great game if they fixed these things,negative
You and 2 of your squad mates land in one of the biggest city in the game and you start looting and after 15 minutes you realize that you don t see or hear any other people around how lucky is that You all find ARs and one of you finds Kar98 And then he finds one more Kar98 and you go to pick it up but on your way there you find Kar98 yourself 3rd guy finds SKS which he likes better and you all are happy and continue to loot the city and what do you know you find suppressor for AR lucky you but whats that in the next building  Another suppressor for AR so now your squad have 2 but wait next building you find one more suppressor and look at that all squad has suppressed ARs in hand Now you 3 just need to find some attachments for your sniper rifles You go form building to building and there are no sniper rifle attachments anywhere just nada How about a scope better then 2x  Nop who do you think you are that you deserve 8x or even 4x  But thats ok at least white circle has landed great for you for the 3rd time this game and each of you have 7 first aids and bags full of boosts and ammo But look at that next circle is in the worst and furthest place possible and you don t see any vehicle anywhere 2 of you just try to run for circle  You start to realize in how deep of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you are cause running in this late zone eats your life away super fast And then miracle happens your buddy actually finds a jeep you are saved he makes it to you and you just use some aid kits and some boosts and you just have to drive 20m to the circle and you will finally get to kill some people with all thouse great weapons In fact you will win this there is no way you are not winning this with all this loot You all get in to the jeep and as soon as it starts moving 2 of you are looking at your desktops with crash report window because game just shut down And what do you hear from your 3rd buddy  Turns out there were 3 guys camping at the edge of the zone and they killed him instantly 1010 would cry myself to sleep again,positive
Has potential but is horribly optimizedIt has a memory leak and uses around 5 gb ingame and 4gb in the lobbyI have 8gb ram and i have to run it on low memory mode and with the lowest settingsHowever the gameplay is addicting and thrilling Every second could be your last and you have to think fast and think tactically to survive Even thought it s permadeath spawning in another game usually just takes about a minuteThe game also feels better than compared to games like DayZ where you sometimes run for hours withour finding and enemy or a decent weapon only to get blown apart by someone with a superior rifle In this game you find decent weapons usually pretty quick and the island has jsut the right size to not be empty and not be crowdedI ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU ARE OKAY WITH PLAYING ON LOW SETTINGS ETCThe game has also loading issuesMy current recommendation is for an early access game if this game runs this horribly on release I wll not recommend it,positive
This is the one Early Access game I don t regret buying the dev team behind it actually gives a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about the playerbase The new micro transactions that are coming are purely cosmetic and do nothing to give anyone an advantage I for one am happy they are coming out with another way for me to support them can t wait to kill people in a mini skirt school uniform Can t wait to see how the game changes over time,positive
Glitches  A few Bullet drop  kinda Early access  Yup Fun  A whole f ing lot This game is what a BR should be No it does not have crazy bullet physics Or require a whole lot of skill outside of not doing something stupid like standing in a field But damn if this game aint a ton o fun,positive
This game is in pre alpha but its still fun Personally i prefer this over H1Z1,positive
Its a battle royal type game with alot of looting and fun to be had,positive
With the release of the 10 update the game has gotten significantly better  The game s optimization is much better before 10 i would get around 50   80 on Erangel  The original map but with this update i get around 80 100 on it and on Miramar  The desert map i get about 90 120  The vaulting in my opinion is very smooth but could use some fixes it seems sometimes inconsistent on what you can vault on and can t It also looked much cooler in the original reveal trailer of it than it does now but i suspect thats for the sake of first person because rolling in it would be very annoying but thats just a visual thing I do appreciate being able to have a key dedicated to vaulting as it does seem a bit more consistent than the jumpvault key  The UI looks very nice especially the new main menu which is a HUGE upgrade  The new sounds for vehicles make it easier to tell which vehicle is which  The new bomb zone sounds sound awesome,positive
All these people LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing about micro transactions are ridiculous It in no way what so ever effects the actual gameplay It is all cosmetic The game itself is incredibly fun and addicting The developers are very active there are weekly bug fixes and atleast once every month there is a large update adding new feturesweaponsect This is by far the best early access game I have bought Possibly the best early access game ever made,positive
i see people being LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about bans for friendly fire but WHY  it s ruining the game  don t have a squad of buddies to play with  don t bother doing squad drops 80 percent of my non friend squad games result in friendly fire death  they need to start banning for this stuff,negative

vpnSo that we Chinese players generally rarely in the evaluation of the speech but now we have a major rumor here that you will be the game of the Chinese service agent to Tencent if so I am very disappointed We will choose a refund Tencent in China s evaluation is extremely bad I hope to carefully consider the idea of Chinese players consider we use vpn also play this game players If you give this game agent to Tencent we are really disappointed Hope that the international friends and the production of this game can see our ideasI only can speak a little EnglishThis is the result of Google translationIf you look harder please forgive me,positive
EDITED  I have changed my review to reccomend this game  The developers have made a lot of progress fixing below issues and the game is running smoother on midlevel systems nowDeveloper is having issues fixing de synch and poor optimization leading to constant issues in close quarters firefights  Often times it seems like people kill you before you even see them around a corner  The game is fun but highly frustrating right now due to overall stability issues  Honestly it is quite a disapointment considering the popularity of the game  Don t buy until it is fixed if they ever fix it at all  early access devs tend to cut and run with their games,positive
90 hours and I m not sure the game has much more to offer Even in a different environment I can t imagine it will be more exciting after I learn the mapThis game is frustrating for a number of reasions   How enjoyable a round will be is determined by RNG   better hope you get a good flight path and good spawns  If you don t spawn with good guns or a vehicle the game becomes a running simulator  The combat system is very janky and the hitboxes seem to be drawn by Picasso  The devs just added microstransactions to an early access game full of bugs The game has sold like 3 million  copiesI will say that most of the time playing with a squad of friends is fun but playing any game with a squad of friends is funCan t really recommend it,negative
Hello today I am going to make a review on one of the best games on steam right now Also I will be defending it from the backlash of the recent dicisions the devs have made First PUBG gives you lots of emotions Sometimes you will feel sad andry or joyful But that is what makes this game so great The rush you feel when you land that epic headshot or your in a mad max style car chace these moments with your friends can t just happen in most games  Secondly there is no reason for the community to be in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE torm that it is in right now because of the announced micro transactions Micto transactions are completely fine if they stay COSMETIC AND COSMETIC ONLY If it stays cosmetic  which is the plan  then no player will have a certain advantage over the other Finally about the devs banning that stream sniper the devs have special tools that help them find out if the person is sniping or not Coming from a guy that has tried countless related titles you will not be disapointed in buying PUBG,positive
game is great loving it  ,positive
Definetly a great game still needs a little work but its still in early access so its understandable Very fun to play with your friends on squad or duos and even on solos Recommend 100 ,positive
This game is great but has some flaws If you do not have a beast of a computer you may run this game at 20 30 fps or not be able to run it at all The adjustments to the loot crate system have come under fire but you can just ignore it It is scummy but has this stopped people from enjoying csgo or overwatch  Of course not The gameplay can be a little glitchy at times so stay away from the 3 seater bike Besides that and some other things it is a great game that I highly recommend Oh and sell the loot crates if you can the new ones go for 2 bucks Easy money if you ask me,positive

I got into this game to play with friends and for a large amount of the time I had fun with it  This game was even a factor for me to upgrade my gaming hardware around fall of 2017  As time went on I found that the things I enjoyed seem to become less and less of a thing and that the game as a whole began to become stagnant  The fun firefights I used to have have just faded into a blurr of excessive camping desynchit registering and repetition  I was bummed when they removed weather effects and I also feel that the design of Myamar leaves games as either insanely quick from dropping in the 2 3 hot spots on the map or a 10 minute walk or drive while you wait to find where a team might be dug inI enjoyed PUBG for the Milsim aspect of grabbing guns and gear to kit out for the endgame  I feel it touched on something I truly enjoyed in the DayZ standalone and the shooting felt infinitely better than H1Z1 to where I used to be excited to spend my afternoons and evenings on the game  Leading up to the launch of the game as well as post launch I see that the direction of the game is one where I can t get behind  Inefficient anti cheat systems to try to deal with a rampant hacker problem locked loot crates and weapon skinsI m not much a fan of Fortnite either  I think the whole building spam in a battle royale game is just obnoxious but with the state of the game PUBG is in I d recommend just playing that for free instead of buying in here,negative

A tribute to PUBG or How I met Arielle It all starts one day a Weasel does what a Weasel does Climbing mountains enjoying the view and the sunny weather Eventually the Weasel found a motorbike and thought   Hell why not let s try it and enjoy the sun and the wind on your fur So he took the bike running downwards the mountain as fast as he could to meet other humas so they feed him with chickens when suddendly a ramp appears The Weasel cried happy tears   Look at me I am a flying Weasel  before he hit a branchThe motorbike flipped towards the ground the Weasel hit his head softly but obviously hard enough because the next thing he remembered was cold wet water on his fur  Picture 1 He found himself trapped in water below the island He tried so hard to reach the surface and he seems to reach it because he can breath but it s probably just a surface below the surface He yells at humans but they are just passing by not recognizing the wet ball of fur  Picture 2 The zone is coming the chickens are running Ursula is sucking my soul out RIP WSL  Picture 3 Highly recommended,positive
This game has great potential the dev team needs to fix the general gameplay and make it a bit more stable Aiming and CQC fells a bit unpolished And there is the problem of FPS drops,positive
Would definitely recommend this It pulls you in with excitement stealth role play elements and a community spirit that a lot of AAA titles seem to lack these days  im looking at you COD  It does have the odd bug   weird glitch or two floating around but it keeps you coming back time and time again As its early access this is to be expected Regarding the up roar over micro transactions appearing before its fully released PU has released an explanation in this months update explaining that the system needs to be tested and apologized for poor communication on the issue You dont have to participate in the marketplace and this game wont be turning into a pay to win jamboree  To me it seems a lot of the moaning going on is unjustified PU has demonstrated a commitment to the titles he s released and for someone to go from simply modding a game to releasing their own title on this scale is a hell of an achievement  The guy just needs time to fine tune work out the kinks and process feedback from the community So be patient kick back and look forward to that chicken dinner,positive
Won my first match with russiansnote  they are nice and good at aimingedit  i like how them stupid fools play on squad without a mic lil LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s,positive
Great game but highly unstable with framerate I d play at 60 fps and still get random freezes and just poor gameplayRequested a refund as it just got worse,negative
I cannot endorse a game   that continues to cater to streamers who get members of the community banned because they refuse to put a simple delay on their streamsI cannot endorse a game that after months of play hasn t patched lag in the audio Lag when encountering enemy players I cannot endorse a game that doesn t allow you to jump or vault  coming soon coming soon bla bla blaI cannot endorse a game that has micotransactions but the game itself is still terribly broken They have turned it into a for profit mechanisim by using streamers as advertisting and the purchasing of items only proves thisAnd finally the most important part of all I cannot endorse a game where you don t have fun on a consistent basis  When playing a game where everytime you encouter an enemy you  experience audio lag or suffer from a terrible refresh rateThey allow streamers to have test server access   to practice and get better But the rest of us are left to try out that sniper rifle or 8x scope for the 1st time without any knowledge of it s characteristicsDo not buy this game It s just not fun yet,negative

This game has so much potential to be a great and complete game but if Bluehole insists on focusing on microtrasactions before fixing bugs and balancing I can t recommend anyone buy it at this time There is so much potential here and I would hate to see this game turn into something so focused on money and cosmetics like CSGO,negative
This is the best early access game I have bought  so far  I have gotten quite a few at this point  Rust had a good thing going then they changed engines and ruined it Ark was fun for about a week H1Z1 I don t know where to startAnyways it has started off great I can t see them f  ing it up at this point,positive
bluehole dev plans to milk this early access game before full release dont buy it until they fix the game THEN they can start adding cosmetics,negative
very nice game I like,positive
i know the game is in beta but   the game is full cheater   100 players per game so it s hard to not have a cheater with this numbers  you can be sure to have 1 cheater per game you can control with google  forum is not safe  no training mode  Servers are really BAD  the game can be really amazing but the develloper aren t working to control hacks they prefer correct the small bugs  and it s hard to found a bug in dat gamehave a nice day and don t waste your money for this gameps no support   no players  and finish bluehole game,negative
would play also wish it had the karambits for waepon,positive
If I could give it stars it would be about a 4 Fun game and I love that they cut down on the wait between matches The crate system is a complete joke More customization of the characters would be a plus Other than that fun game for sure,positive
To this day I have not won a single match but I still love the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of this gameEdit  I ve won one squad match with randoms,positive
Welp worth the PTSDThe last time I played a PC game longer than an hour was a game that rhymed with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  That was 3 years ago I haved owned PUBG for just over a month and just hit 200 hours Never thought a game with more loses than wins could ever be so much fun Finally a game that isn t like any other The  Battle Royal  genre is a game for me that requires attention skill and good timing All the other gun slinging games get too repetitive and not any real teamwork PUBG introduces urban strategies that allows you to fight with what you got Some situtations are good bad and just pure luck But for the most part you are in control to make the best of it as much as you canNo game is perfect but no game is fun if you can t get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off Hats off to PUBG and wishing for the final product soon Thank you for restoring my PC gaming edge,positive

its a epic game,positive
This game is so fun sometimesBut then there are the times where your car hits a invisible rock and flips over twenty times only to explode when it finally LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stops flipping around Then there is the issue with the bikes flipping you onto your head and killing youThis game really REALLY needs to go back into early access It should never of been released this early I don t know why they released it without fixing half the holes in the desert map where you can get trapped and have no way to escape other than suicide There are also points in the desert map that you cannot revive your teammates It will get to around 33 seconds and then stop Why  Also there s a tower you can climb on top of near Minas Generales if you get on a roof of a car and then climb up the ladder via vaulting Also all the people dying from vaulting and the car physics None of this should be in a full release game All these issues should of been fixed during the early access phase right But despite all the issues that are still occuring within this game during its full release state I still love it It s still my favorite game It s still a hell of a lot of fun Not many games are quite like this one pitting you against 99 over players in a fight to the death over supplies with the end goal of the ever elusive chicken dinner  I mean who doesn t love seeing the message  WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER  It s satisfying and awesome to outplay 99 other people who also want that win It s great You ll have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  matches and you ll have amazing matches You ll have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t deaths happen to you and make you mad but this game will still be fun Always and forever PUBG will be a great game,positive
Great game to kill some hours with It s good if you want to survive by yourself with a friend or in a squad Only downside to this game is that you need a decent pc to run it although there are some tutorials on youtube on how to fix the lag but I wouldn t recommend getting it if you have a pc that wont be able to handle the game,positive
Most fun I ve had in a multiplayer game in ages Has superb pacing and is a blast when played with friends I cannot recommend this enough if you are in the market for a competitive shooterEdit  Game is fine People are just whiney asshats because of some cosmetic lootcrate keys being sold in support of a PUBG E sports event So many tears,positive

it took like 5 tries but they finally made a good battle royale game now we just wait for it to die in alpha and we can come back and thumb it down,positive
it s a really fun game the community is nice and finding a game is fast I don t think it should have a bad review based on adding microtransaction especially if it s only for esthetic purpose I can t wait for the final release,positive

At the moment I can t recommend the game There are way too many game breaking bugs at the moment that have not been patched I have to flip a coin to see if the game will load me into a match without freezing or disconnecting me from a game I d say wait until the game comes out of early access or at least 2 years before you purchase the game I don t think this game will last much longer the way it is and I definitely won t buy games in early access anymore,negative

Here is the deal with PUBGThe game is alright It has horrible performance and if you have anything worse than a 1060 you SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME But my biggest issue with the game is Fortnite Fortnite is a very similar experience but it faces none of the issues with pubg The game is a lot more fast paced and fun It is much easier to pick up and enjoy Also it can run on a potato and the engine is much more polished And its free So The only reason for picking up PUBG is if you want a battle royale with military combat But Im assuming that for most people fortnite will be a better and more casual experience Which is what BR should be Casual,negative
One of the most exciting games I have ever played,positive
Brilliant laugh lots of variables that add a whole nother level of game play to just basic pew pew I recommend this for sure great for a group of mates to play coms essenmtial though Well worth the price Would just love some new weapons perhaps rotate whats available etc Make the weapons a bit more uber cool looking like Buy it,positive

THis game is amazing I havent had this much fun in a game since overwatch Micro transactions are in everygame but they are for cosmetics nothing that will give you an advantage There is no level up system its litteraly jump out of plane survive and try to get your chicken dinner by being the last man standing out of 100 people on an island Its fun as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Its litteraly the best game ever sure its buggy as hell and it crashes for somereason when i try to run fraps But it works90  of the time and anytime its crashed it has booted right up no problem It has bugs its early access you ll expect it Worth the 30 especially when the price will probably go up when it releases My only con is that with my setupI3 61008gb DDR4Gtx 1050tiSSDI get like 30fps on max settings medium im getting like 50fps Not sure why i can play WoW and Overwatch on max settings getting at least 80 100fps But I assume that PUBG is just not finished and not optimized and as time goes on it will run alot smoother other than that its great 1010 would play again,positive
first of all DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY on this crap game atleast 1 hacker is in every game believe me Its so fkn bad and plus all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimizations and the gun codes is just like a fkn roblox fps game This LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  has potential and all but its just overflooded with chinese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and Hriga missbildade fat hackers Just go and play fortnite instead,negative
The game itself is great but battleye is horrible It corrupted and i have to completely reinstall windows 10 to run the game,negative
PlayerUnkowns needs to stop taking money baths and start fixing this game The amount of time my game crashes the connection is closed and all sorts of issues is crazy I own a 2000 computer and I still can t hit over 40fps The game lags so much no matter how good your internet is Apart from this the game is very enjoyable and gets my heartrate going but PlayerUnknowns needs to do a lot of work on this game,negative

cool but you need a pretty good gaming rig,positive
After putting 250 hrs in I have changing my positive review to negative Not worth anymore It started fun because there was a steep learning curve and the idea of getting better was enticing to beat plebs who werent as talented The reality is thus Aggressive playstyle  join game and hope for a better loot spawn than opponent 15 times you will kill unarmed cheer  look for others to kill  get in gun fight with up to 10 people and win 15 times then see NO ONE for 20 more minutes  die to someone camping  rinse and repeat winner will RARELY happen because you are in it to shoot at people and have fun  the only people who successfully have this play style are incredibly rare such as the top twitch players with super high end connections and machines they will be running at 120 during a fight and your good computer will drop to 35Stealthy playstyle  land somewhere you most likely won t fight at all or be killed  go to center of playzone  stay relatively quiet and kill MAYBE 1 2 people   get top 10 45 times you try to  highest chance of winning people will literally sit around a corner for 40 minutes without moving to kill you At first it was kinda funny and entertaining Very quickly it turning petty and lame If you look at the leader boards the people with the most wins average like 3 kills That means they don t interact with other players for 40 out of 45 minutesCONCLUSION Not Worth Pros  Good voice chat system easy to make friends Hillarious moments 110 play throughs is funCons  The movement and aiming and positioning is so cumbersome and clunky it will make you wonder why in 2017 they couldn t get these simple things right  everything else 910 play throughs just isn t fun anymoreOriginal review is below ______________________________________________________________________________Overall worth No other game makes you LOL like this one Frustrating and rewarding   how a game should bePros fun competetive make lots of friends easily rewarding when you get items or win hillarious car flips based on skill for many aspectsCons By far the largest con is you will die 1000 times and have no idea from where or from whom They need to add red damage indicators if I am shot in the back realistically I should know the direction I was shot from RNG loot is placed so if you land beside the gun you kill whoever lands beside you without one Latency and sync aren t bad but in a game that is so sensitive its horrible players with high end systems get drastically better gameplay and fps which gives a tremendous edge  players who get good at jump exploits  grimmz jumping through windows  and use them relentlesslysummaryget the game they have enough funds to make it great,negative
One of the big promises they made when they first started creating this game was that there would be no micro transactions Well that turned out well,negative
This game is good but the Bluewhite lines move WAYYYYYYY to fast not enough time to forage and it just gets smaller too fast you need to be able to run with it or at least run inside of the blue not be overtaken by the blue and then lose out on all that work,negative
Alot of people writing reviews apprently do not realize this is an early access game and still being improved daily and monthly with updates Sure the game isn t perfect but the the game play is unparalleled it feels very hard and exciting when you win unlike other games were you do the same thing over and over this game the fights the circle the gameplay is always different which makes it a fun and rewarding experince when you over come and win the match So yes for 30 pick it up you can t get a game like this for that price,positive
I may not have a lot of hours on this game at the moment but all I can say is this game is just amazing Deffinitely the best  battle royale game out there,positive
the game is not worckimg to me ples fix thes problem,negative
i really like this game from what i haved played of it but the optimation is crap i would consider my pc a mid end pc with most games running 144fps with high grphics but with PUBG it all very low and im geting 40 60 fps but that is not to scare u away i just want to make a note to the publishers to work on that,positive
Movement is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and when ever your near an enemy you lag the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out and its not going to change since full release will be soon but concept is great just wait until a big developers copy this so they can actually make a good one,negative
st I give the game a 2 out of 10 Now hear me out  The game is soooo bug ridden you think your staying at a 1 star hotel in Havana If you can finally manage to get into the lobby and get all your mates into the lobby which is after 27 to 500 restarts then and ONLY then are you doing OK the game is great the bugs will kill this game its gonna be DAYZ in 6 months if they dont fix the issues,negative

Game seeems great but as much as I have been playing it seems the lag detection is worse than overwatch No matter what server you re connected to regardless of region it seems like you can get shot behind complete cover It was not like this from the start nor is it like this during non peak hours I have great connection with less than 40 ping during normal hours and my 3 other friends get the same issue These lag issuses need to be solved otherwise the game is going to go under like king of the kill,negative

FIX YOUR ANTI CHEAT got perma banned for nothing and without proofFirst of i do love the game and enjoy playing it for sureThe Ban system is currently LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed upOnly time i ve killed teammates is because of explosions of stuck vehicles or when my friend s game used to crash back in the day and their character remained ingame with all the gear they sure have not reported me so there s no point looking at my in game data so there should be no proof for the banOfc when you solo a DUO game on NA servers and win with 22kills ss in profile the amount of players with really high pitch 10y olds  tend to falsely report you which might get some attention to your accountAlso there is no timer AKA u have no idea how long your ban will last or will it end at all which gives you the urges to buy the game on a second account specially now that the new loot boxes are comingi d just like to know how long my ban lasts okay  i am happy with the updates that improve the game weekly and monthly while still pushing out more content just fix your system okayEDIT  i have been permanently banned by the anti cheat team and i am rather LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  as i ve not done LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ShadowPlay is the only thridparty programm i have while playing and they banned me for Hacksthridparty this better be because some scrubs have reported me from stream sniping or something just get your anti cheat together dammitAlso the microtransactions which they promised not to be a thing before the game releases are now coming to fund their Esport tournament  like they could not use any of that 100 million dollars they ve made just with the sales i don t really mind tho i want the tracksuit lol,negative

I ve sunk about 10 hours this past week into Pubg when the 10 released and I must say to the devs well donePros  Gameplay is fun and addicting I get over 40 FPS on my crappy computer Squad and duo feature allow for even more fun with friends The new map Miramar is a great addition to the game and is way better in my opinion to their first map A lot of guns AKM Scar M416 M16 etc keep the shooting fun but challenging Not too expensiveCons  Servers are laggy as balls as of this moment 122417 I rubberband constantly until the player count drops to under 80 Makes it almost unplayable Not relatively cheap either Game is kind of optomized but not to the level it should be atOverall the game is really good but my major complaint as of right now is the lagging If that would be fixed I would love the game even more,positive
Please remove fog from the game it is what the whole community wants Thanks  ,positive
this is more of a response to anyone who reads all the stupid comments about the micro transactions its cosmetic only does not hinder anything in the game at all you are not forced to buy the crate and they are adding in 2 other crates FOR FREE but no one wants to talk about how they update almost weekly and fix any bugs that the game has to anyone that enjoys an all out war should get this game 100  great game and to the devs keep up the constant bug fixs  ,positive

TL DRIf you want my advice at all DO NOT BUY THE KEYS Let them know that we do not want this Congratulations guys you went from the saviors of the Early Access community to exactly what other Early Access games are You ve decided to make a game that everyone loves and enjoys and put something that a large majority of people hate and see it as a cancer to the communities that it is put in Microtranactions Honestly I don t even get the whole  we re gonna put microtransactions into the full game    http contentinvisionciccomr273030monthly_2017_07PUHOWCOULDYOUjpg6f626f5935bf73c4f94b7b9f9f15ee15jpg  First off it makes no sense Full games shouldn t have micros because it s stupid Why should a game that you pay 30 for make you pay more for keys to open a crate for a chance to get an item That s bad business practice and it shows that they just want more money I also don t understand how with over 5 million copies sold  July 29th 2017 that they can t just host this GAMESCOM PUBG INVITATIONAL and have the prize money come from the money that they got from selling the game They would rather it come from the  key  system that they are putting together,negative

These are some trash developers who cant do a proper game if it bit them in the buttThis game is so heavily RNG based I dont understand why they think they can run competitive tournamentsOne guy drops and gets a helmet and backpack the next guy gets a shotgun  Fair   Fun   Not any of thatIts a crappy under developed broken piece of software that is not worth your time money or frustrationThese bluehole idiots are making money off of not only an unfinished product but one that can never be competitive in its current formRNG inherently isnt bad but whoever designed the loot tables needs to be fired castrated and burned at the stakeYou know what whoever designed this game just do it to all of them  010 Would not recommend,negative

I would really like to recommend this game because I think it is actually a really good game but I can tLet me explain when it first came out it was a fairly unique game and showed some real promise the concept was great the graphics were really good and the game play and physics were good it was an all round great game and I really enjoyed playing it However very quickly the cheats and hackers moved in and regardless of what the developers may say they are still hereGradually over time this problem has got worse and worse single kill headshots are very common now there are videos on youtube which actually show someone getting a headshot while the target is completely hidden behind a rock and others are blatantly showing off their hacksIt is also confusing how you can be lying in the long grass behind a tree and take one shot at someone running in the open about 500  600 meters away with a silenced sniper rifle with an 8 x scope and that player instantly turns round tilts their head to one side and put a round straight into you before you have had time to fire a second round I dont care how good you are but you cannot locate the direction of a shot that fast let alone get a perfect shot offAnother issue is the death cam either this shows just how many people are hacking  no one ever seems to be aiming or even anywhere near you when they kill you or the death cam itself is so poor its useless and may as well not be there I would like to mention at this point that there are some really excellent players on this game who you may expect are cheating but they are not they are just really good but as you like me are not in their league you should never be matched with them unless the matching system is also flawed and uselessThere are various glitches like invisible rocks that stop your car in its tracks  and remove some of your health disappearing hedges and floating objects although this sort of thing is to be expected in any game these daysAt the end of all this you reward for dedication and perseverance A crate which you either have to pay real money to open or get a t shirt you already have pointless Although there do seem to be an awful lot of idiots out there spending a lot of money on in game clothingSo over all this is why I cant recommend it because if I did you may spend good money on it and as you would be new and inexperienced you are likely to get wiped out very quickly and then the monotony of jumping landing looting running from the blue line then getting killed by an impossible head shot will soon hit you and you will regret buying itThere are now many other games like this one out there although I have not bought them as I am afraid they will be much the same but check out their review and maybe give one of them a try instead,negative

GOOD GAME  ,positive
Fun to play but still kind of glitchy The crates for cosmetics cost too many battle points 30 for the level of content available right now with upcoming microtransactions is pretty steep  probably worth 15 really As an early access title this is a hard call on if you should buy or not  it has a lot of promise but it seems like their decisions are starting to turn in bad ways  the finished product may not end up being worth the cost,positive
Game is great mechanics are very similar to Arma III which is expected from playerunknown s past modding experience Anyone who says microtransactions are bad can just not buy them and shut up,positive
Buggy frustrating but despite all the problems it is a really great experience with friends,positive
Dont use a controllerAfter using a controller i wanted to back to the default settings and after trying to find differents ways to do it i cant play and by that the only thing i can do is move the screen cant run or anything,negative
This game is fun if you like paying to look like a fuc,negative
I have already played about 20 hour Great game funny and great if you want turn off your brain and just smash few heads    there are few glitch  but its early access so no problem   for me  great game,positive

Hackers Enough said WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL If you want to win the game camp If you are unsure where to drop drop military base because the map ends there 90  of the time If you can pick up a shotgun as it can snipe people across maps even when they have a vest on and they are more powerful than Zeus s lightning bolt The scaling of damage on shotguns are ridiculousThe fences and walls in this game are also ridiculous This game was an awesome game before the recent updates This game needs a MASSIVE amount of altering PS PlayerUnknown guarenteed at least 80  of the players DO NOT WANT TO PLAY ON THE RAIN MAP You can t hear a thing and all you have to do to win on that map is to go prone and not even GOD HIMSELF can see youThe altering of the circle times have also destroyed the game That extra minute makes a huge difference as you can go through at least 2 more houses to look for that sniper rifle that you re not going to find What is up with the water in the game as well  Just because you are in the water or submerged all of a sudden you have become an invincible demigod  The hell is up with that  Want to make top 10 at least  All you have to do is  find a car drive it to the centre of the circle and sit in a bush and VOILA Instant top 10 Even with foilage at  very low  you still can t see people in certain bushes Super realistic  3WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL,negative

What is the sense of developing a game if a buyer can t even connect to the server I know PUBG team is sorry They try so hard to do the best but if you really are so sorry guys just give me my money back    I paid you and and have to play other games instead of yours Good job I did a business of a lifetime,negative

TLDR  Performance of game is terrible mods are banning for stupid reasons paid crates in early access and devs are working on console port when PC version isn t finished Skip this for now unless you have multiple friends to play with and a super computerAt this point in time I cannot recommend this game to anyone There are multiple problems with this game that need fixed before the developers make this game great instead of good1 The optimization is absolutely atrocious Now I average probably about 60 FPS on good areas on the map but sometimes those are hard to come by My game constantly drops down to 1 FPS  yes you read that right in areas and it ll happen in about 3 5 second intervals which makes the game unplayable Now before you ask if my PC can even run this game my specs are an i5 4690k OC d to 42 Ghz with an OC d GTX 1070 and the game is on an SSD I have tried almost every settings guide and tinkered with settings for a couple hours and nothing has worked for me2 Playerunknown  the creator of the game himself needs to get mods under control I have seen a couple posts on Reddit about people being banned for  stream sniping  from killing popular PUBG streamers when in fact they were not stream sniping The mods banned these people without hard evidence that this was happening which is not okay 3 Last but not least Playerunknown has announced that he wants to introduce PAID crates in an UNFINISHED EARLY ACCESS game This is unacceptable There is so much that needs worked on in this game and they decide to try and make a cash grab move before the game is even at full release Imagine if the amount of time and effort to implement this would go into optimization of the gameIn conclusion I cannot recommend this game to anyone without an i7 7700K and a GTX1080 Ti and even then it might be if y The developer needs to get his priorities in order to make this game better than the average early access DayZH1Z1 like game Edit  Playerunknown has announced that there will only be one paid crate as a test in early access and has explained in further detail of how the system will work so point three is now invalidAlso August s update looks promising optimization wise so hopefully some issues will be fixedEdit 2  After the initial August update my optimization seemed to improve on a small scale I do get better FPS in some areas and do not have drops but in medium to large townscities the performance is still terrible Mini rant  They have now officially announced they ve partnered with Microsoft to make a port to Xbox One which is not the right thing to do in my opinion Without the game being finished on PC I believe they will rush andor not finish the game for us because of Microsoft s agenda If this game comes out polished straight out the gate on console I will be furious Finish the PC version first then port to console,negative

You got avarage sight of this game but its actually a video card killer till now it cannt be runned smoothly The bottom line servers are always busy Could you build up more servers upon your profit,negative
This game is pure PVP battle Royale at its finest  Now you are gonna hear a lot of crap from others raging about micro transactions but they neglect to tell you that the micro transactions are optional they are for cosmetic items only and the money will go towards funding a tourement and charity  They will not effect gameplay in the least  IF someone tells you otherwise they are lyingThe game is early access so its rough around the edges but at its heart is a great PVP experience  Play solo duo with a partner or in a squad of up to 4 friends  or random duos and squads  if you want  You and 99 other folks parachute from a plane into a deserted russian island  You have to find weapons ammo and armor to protect yourself  Fight your way to the designated area as the game forces the survivors into an ever shrinking bubble  Travel around the map consists of either dune buggy motorcycle  with or without side car Sedan or Jeep  You can go on foot but there is a lot of ground to cover as the island is 7 x 75km  Crossing an open field in the bubble is a dangerous ventureGreat game  Bumpy ride at times as it is early access but worth the purchase price,positive
They are rich but this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game is not improved at all It s stupid to pay for a game in this current state,negative
Okay I ll start by saying this  This game has come a long way from being barely playable with insane bugs and fps drops to a smooth experience fun gameplay and a nice time killer I recommend this to anyone who likes a good ol  battle royale and also likes more realism graphics guns and so on Pros  A fun battle royale game that is also challenging Amazing graphics Smooth experience most of the time Big weapon choice Event mode third and first person modes Regional servers Rewarding crates that don t always require a key to openCons  Only two maps Sometimes lags and fps drops happen,positive
Perfect balance between the PlayerUnknown mod for Arma 3 and H1Z1 Game is devoloping fast and should only get better as it goes on Laggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  tho,positive
super fun ever growing and great to play either solo or with friends you play against about 100 peop le in a single lobby and the vast number of weapons attachments and gear combined with the randomness of the safe zone the plane position and loot drops makes the game an insanely fun rollercoaster of luck survival and skill i highly recommend this game not only because it is fantastically fun but also because each day the team improves the game by adding more vehicles weapons and patching bugs as well as optimizing the game more and more,positive

Could have been a good game but recent decisions on the game  including micro transactions instead of fixing the real issues they are having in EA i can t recommend it They have mislead players and they even ban players for  purposeful TKing  and  stream sniping  even though there is no good way to prove itSteer clear for now Re evauluate after full release,negative
The one and only PUBG For someone who has played H1Z1 like a religion and now this game I believe that this game is hands down the better out of the Battle Royale games on Steam This game is full of heart racing moments that can begin the second you take off the parachute The map is very beautiful and well designed On top of all its aspects the team of developers supporting it is very open to community feedback and requests There is a reason this game has sold 6 million copies in under 5 months I definitely recommend playing this game with friends as it increases the  spontaneous  factor many times more than in solo,positive
Buy this for me please,positive
Here is a positive review to counteract the crying babies about the cost of new COSMETIC crates 1 If you care that much about cosmeticsyou re going to be the first to pay for them2 Don t like the crate system   Run around naked and kill people with the skins to collect them in game  eat that Pokemon go3 Already paid 30 WHOLE dollars for a game that you ve gotten 100 hours out of   Oh noes What else can you do for 33 cents an hour  4They are donating crate money to an intentional prize pool and charity   Yes people will get upset over this somehowAbout early access1 I bought dayz standalone That is an example of how not to do early access2 Bugs   Yep Fixing them and keeping players up to date   Yep see a bug report it If all early access was like this I d jump on every oneThis game 1 Play as you like Aggressive or passive but the circle rules all2 Introducing fpp My god thank you3 Keeping on schedule Yep4heart pumping and stressful YepTo date Even if they stopped all updates Still worth the 30 for what is there That s an amazing early access,positive

10 15 for the chance at an outfit  with an equal chance that you won t even get an entire outfit let alone repeat items is ridiculous If you want to charge for some premium outfit crate    fine But there should be a way to earn in game cosmetics through playing just like you can now Super disappointed,negative
It runs quite bad on every average PC  unless you have some massive tank of a computer and it s actually kind of expensive but if you can get past that it s just funAnd that s all that matters PUBG is just a fun game Grab some friends and go for gold EDIT  2282018Okay so this game isn t good Now don t get me wrong it s not horrible It s just not good I still recommend it if you have some friends and a beefy PC but that does not mean that it is a well made video game The thing is this game was created very sloppily It runs like absolute hot garbage and the actual gameplay is very unintuitive Playing is fun yes until you get sniped from across the map and have to start over again That s where the monotony kicks inPUBG is fun but it s not a good game 510,negative

95 people drop from a plane onto an island You parachute to an area as far away from other people as you can but it s still uncomfortably close to a couple of other people  2 or 3 that you saw parachuting down nearby You loot the first house or two  meaning you walk inside find a pistol and maybe a tactical vest and ammo laying in the middle of the floor in a pile You go outside look around to be sure your friends haven t started closing in on you You loot the next house  remember it s copypaste pile in the middle of the floor The game begins telling you that the playing area is shrinking and you have 2 minutes to get inside the new boundaries You go outside happy with the amount of firearmsbandagesammoarmor that you have and start making your way toward where the game is

person who was sniping at you will have to go to the new smaller zone at some point He comes out armed with an sks and wearing underwear and an afro You try to run him over and succeed taking a few hits to the car and some minor damage to your player You hear gunshots nearby You see that there are only 45 players remaining so you hurry to the middle of the new zone You heal up with your bandages and prepare for the last bit of fighting I mean there s half left so you re going to win right  You loot nearby structures carefully clearing them room by room It s getting close to the finale now There s 25 people left You re stoked You can see the magic blue boundaries for 360 degrees around you So you re crouched down waiting licking your dorito stained lips in excitement for what is about to transpire You see a small shack that is 2 stories high about 15 yards from you so you head that way You carefully ascend the stairs and clear the room  no loot You go to open the bathro BAM BAM BAM

Easy to learn hard to master Best way to explain this gameIt has one giant flaw and that is that people with worse computers are at a sometimes huge advantageBushes and foliage are a natural hiding spot but people with less good specifications tend to not get these bushes rendered unless they are close meaning that you think you are in hiding but someone else sees you without problem This can get quite annoying But hey frying pans protect your tushy,positive

So far I ve played 17 hours on this and while I need a lot of practice the game is really enjoyableI ve only played Solo so far and for something that is early access it has a lot of content which is growing all the time with weekly updates My PC at work is a bit basic with an i5 and GTX 560 but it does work with the lowest graphic settings and is playablePC at home is i7 with GTX 1080 and the graphics are a joy to beholdI see my self playing this game for a long time to come and lok forward to future updates and everything they addCan t wait for the extra maps to appear,positive
Finally ping locked players,positive
Although when you are playiong solo it is less enjoyable because you are more focused and less layed back because you dont have anyone to talk to however if you have a friend to play with it becomes a game that is probably one of the funnest and most intriguing games ive played in 2017,positive
Fun if you like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  things,negative

Played heavily on the weary and battered Early Access consumer made promises to be different No paid microtransactions until release suddenly twisting the knife in deeper on the consumerindie developer  outsourced Btw relationship  Can t say I m super shocked but insanely dissapointed in Bluehole s inability to fix the most vital and easily replicated of bugs  Can t heal unless you drop your weapon  And their attitude towards things like lens flare  Should really just be called a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  filter since it s just an ever present dirty monitor filter applied to the game which they have recently forced on  Performance is pathetic yawing between playable and completely unacceptable,negative
Very good game netcode is a little rough though I don t like the concept of micro transactions Whatever happened to releasing full games for retail  Companies now days are all about the  cash grab  I mean who isn t about the money we all our but once all these companies seen how good releasing alpha games are and keeping them in that current state for years they come up with another scheme by doing micro transactions Look blue hole you have made millions of dollars by releasing your game in early access we funded you the money for gamescom How about you do us a favor and hold up to your promise and release micro transactions when the game is in its final state You can fund the esport event with OUR money that you have profited from On another subject joined squad match today everyone placed markers where to drop at I was the only one to drop there Killed 3 guys got downed teammate revived me said  hey hey look look here  I said look at what He shot me and killed me Went to report him on battlegrounds web site only to find out I needed video evidence before they can do anything How about work on that instead of micro transactions,negative
Started out good but i can see the trajectory of the game and it isn t good,negative
Very fun game Its a Battle Royale similar to Arma 3 If your looking for a free roam game where there are different servers made and customized by users I think this game is not for you and if you don t have it yet  You really should have it by now you should get Arma 3 Yes this game is a little buggy but its not bad for an Early Access game Sometime the game can be a little laggy but that is eather 3 reasons 1 your internet is not working 2 Your computer can t handle the game or 3 which is that the game is in Early Access its not gonna be perfect But if you want a Battle Royale game with 100 players stranded on an battling for life and death this game is for youI rate this game 5 stars11 out of 10 would buy this game,positive
God this game is awful If you play in duos you usually get a teammate who doesn t even speak english or doesn t even have a mic to tell you if anyones around If he doesn t speak english then you pretty much lost the game If you play Squads you get a team of 3 whos all in a discord together and ready to split up with you and teamkill you for your gear at start of round In solo I don t know it s good for solo but the other game modes are just terrible,negative
So first if all this game is amazing So many good games Ive had Ive made alot of friends and had a great time Why do i Give this a thumbs down  Microtransactions in the future We need to end this in gaming Micro transactions need to end,negative

This game is great fun to play with friends Requires a decent amount of skill  and some luck to get a chicken dinnerThe latest announcements about a loot cratecase system like CS GO s are however disappointing and completely the opposite of what the developers have been saying since it entered Early Access At the same time the skins that you can get from the crates are very lackluster and boring compared to what you can get in CS GO Follow Overwatch s model or Rocket League s   CS GO s model is not fitting of this game,negative
Bad microtransaction system coming   can only get items through paying for keys to open crates  Dev lied said this wouldn t happen in early access  No tournamentscompetative until end of early access lied again  EA key sales said to be funding tournamentwhere s that promo budget   Start of a slippery slope I think,negative
The game is okay but the price point of 30 is absurd for a game that s only using stock assets and a default pre made shooter system For a game with very little development work done it s far too expensive is the draw back Maybe wait til a full release So on the  buywaitdon t buy scale this is def a wait,negative

No Stop the microtransactions in a 30 dollar game This is completley unwarented with the amount of money this game has made and will eventually spoil the whole thing FREE CRATES ARE BEING REMOVED AFTER THE FULL RELEASE meaning that we will have to buy keys for every crate This is insane and an incredibly bad move on Bluehole s part,negative
too many cheaters,negative
This game is dope and great but if you cant outrun the zone its not fun If you have a leading start on the zone by about 25 meters you should be able to out run the zone the whole rest of the way,positive
People from Reddit are spamming negative reviews because they made an announcement regarding cratekeys They are adding paid crates and paid keys but not until full release  Likely end of this year for those who are uninformedThe system they re implementing in the same as CS GO and doesnt not provide any benefits to the purchaser All skins are purely cosmetic The game needs to have an income to continue support for updates dedicated servers and esports events Games of this magnitude can t survive for years off inital sales At the end of the day Bluehole is a buisness and needs to take more money out then they re putting in If sales were to plummet so would support for the gamePerformance updates make the game run better but I highly recommend having a graphics card and processor released in the last 2 years Even then higher tiermore expensive might still be needed I personally wouldn t go any lower than a GTX970 and 30Ghz without overclockGameplay is fantastic very little bugs Servers are stable for the most part,positive

Microtransaction in early access Don t care what it s for The game is still full of bugs and very much still in alpha I wish I would have known about this a week ago and I would not have bought the gameEdit  kept playing Still full of bugs Still crazy continuous desync issues But some of the most intense moments in any game Hopefully the issues get worked out at some point but it s still fun despite itselfEdit 2  Nothing is worth this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t d sync,negative

Bluehole decided to implement microtransactions in EA instead of balancing and optimizing the game,negative
Devs broke promises and added microtransactions to an early access game if I had known about this before purchasing I probably wouldn t have bought it at all In addittion there are too many networking and framerate issues for me to reasonably recommend this game to a friend I will update my review on full release if this changes but for now it s too glaring an issue and significantly detracts from an otherwise decent game,negative

The current state of PUBG enforces a zero tolerance policy Admins don t care about the context of a TK allowing for trolls to get you banned even if it was for self defenseHeres the context  starts at 2 18 https youtubeGsBSJ_u8J4I t2m18s The player was then banned after reporting the Tk because an admin said he to killed a teammate disregarding all context,negative

I was able to see past the game s shortcomings for quite some time but upcoming patches have caused a change of heart and I no longer forgive the problems this game hasFirst the shortcomings I ve dealt with due to the experience being more positive than not  usually Server issues   it s not uncommon for lag to be a deciding factor in who wins a gunfight You may be shooting at someone for a full second die and then see your ammo count go back up as if you didn t actually shoot as much as you did People can also die a second or sometimes more after you ve STOPPED shooting and they ve turned a corner There s also more non combat related server issues like being a passenger in a car causing serious rubber banding or having issues opening a door and picking up items in the early game since those actions are done server sideA couple months ago the monthly patch was supposed to be about server health but did we get upgraded servers with higher tickrate or more stability  Nah they just did some bugfixesPhysics   there are plenty of gifs on the subreddit or social media of cars jamming into each other and spontaneously combusting or taking a jump and getting a motorcycle stuck in a telephone pole It s funny to look at but when you re actually trying or have good gear it s incredibly frustratingUntil now I ve put up with some severely frustrating issues listed above due to the fact that the developers have communicated decently and frequently though my doubts started setting in during the previously mentioned server health patch However news of an upcoming feature has hurt my trust in them and led me to stop forgiving the problems with the game resulting in a  not recommended LYING   Playerunknown the creator had earlier promised that Early Access sales would be used to continue development on the core game they had a good timeline with a goal of a complete and functional game in 6 months It got delayed which I won t fault them for since unexpected things happen in game development but that s a sign that they really need to focus on the main game s progress isn t it  Well instead of devoting the whole team to such they are going to be implementing CS GO style crates and keys Playerunknown promised that there would be no cosmetic DLC in Early Access and yet now they are implemented the least user friendly greediest form of cosmetic DLCThey broke a simple promise about DLC with money blinding them on real issues I can no longer trust them to follow through with fixing core mechanics and adding real content so for now I have to suggest to anyone considering this game  you re probably better off giving that money to someone else,negative

Sometimes ToxicMostly funny in starting area did over 1000 up and downs also bryan never gets in discord random yelling and cursing during plane rideHeavily RNG Based could go the entire game with no good weapon Dont even have to get a kill in squads to win gameBeen playing for awhile now and i still get the adrenaline rush when im in top 10 very nerve rackingMost of the times the buildings wont load and im at a instant disadvantageIn heavily populated area first one to fina an AR wins no skillMap has gotten pretty boring i already know all the spotsCar physics and 3 seated bike physics are horribleOverall very fun game and addicting and worth the full price very quick to find a lobby810 would reccomend,positive
yes It s good game,positive
If you want to participate in a  fully released  game that has more bugs and working parts and where the devs care more about pushing out more content like weapon skins instead of actually making the game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing work then this is the game for youSeriously though the amount of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that is wrong with this game  Horrible loading times the game flat out crashing at least 10 percent of the time shotguns that are completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing useless if you are not within spitting distance the abhorrent amount of RAM this game eates up  At one point it used 57Gb cheatershackers that run rampant textures not loading properly and the absolutely awful controller configuration for console And if that wasn t enough Brenden Greene being Brenden GreeneBut hey It s fully released Right guys  Right ,negative
You can ruin this game with crates keys hell even with skins You may ignore bugs and cheaters You may LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on the consumers that made this game popular but well there is nothing you re currently doing right so I ll just leave it at that for now,negative

game devs have gone mad due to success   classic early access bait  dont believe me  read discord reddit whatevergoing back on all their promises  microtransactions in early access which they promised there wouldnt be  timeline of updates not being met main dev mocking players distancing and not understanding communityinsane rule system not mentioned anywhere ingame   be warned if you buy this there are hidden rules they can ban you for at any time eg if a team mate tries to teamkill you and you shoot back you will be permanently banned  they recommend disabling default settings if you dont want to get banned for various interactions in the game that are enabled by defaulti enjoy this game  played h1z1 and never really cared about the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t   i wont buy skins even if theyre 001 and ill only play with friends anyway but there are people out there who will be punished unfairlythis game took the spotlight off h1z1 for its failures and now its repeating the same mistakes it seems its more an issue with playerunknown s mindset  protip  he also made the battle royale mode for h1z1  ,negative

Buggy af do not buy,negative
This is an extremely well made and excellent experience with a lot of content to come There really is nothing like the feeling in solo of talking another player in the distance and wondering if they did or didn t see you or coming so close to winning and then dying at the last second or finally winning the gameI would recommend this game to anyone who has a reasonably powerful PC and doesn t mind feeling a little scared and anxious playing a gameIt will definitely get your heart racing,positive
Possibly the worst shooting game experience ever   you would get hit 2 seconds after hiding behind an object  grenade easily stuck mid air or mysteriously moves into the room next door  hit an enemy with blood spill visual effects but damge would not be counted cuz the enemy shot you first in abosolute time and you died 2 seconds ago on the server  hit box is a joke  way too many hackers and even though they are obvious af they are stil around after many patchesAfter a year of updates all those issues are still around,negative
I paid when developer said no paid skins will be added during early access This is no longer the case and an expiring 250 to open case is being added I cannot support this game if the devs will go back on their word like thisThe game is excellent I just don t support this act of going back on your word after people have already given you money,negative
already donload and install but after that this game  cannot runwhy somebody can guide me ,positive
DO NOT BY THIS GAME The developers are showing no signs that they care about the community judging by the waves of bad publicity they are creating and they are actively introducing anti consumer microtransaction systems before the game is even stable let alone complete This information was not avaliable when I purchased it and they actually stated on their official FAQ that they will not be releasing microtransactions until after early access By purchasing this game you are encouraging this kind of behaviour and voting with your wallet that you want content to be cut and re labled as DLC or microtransactions I myself will be attempting to get a refund on this game because I would not have bought it if I had known then what I know nowWent back on a promise not to include microtransactions or DLC until after early access  https wwwredditcomrPUBATTLEGROUNDScomments6piovxjust_say_no_to_realmoney_keys_keys_and_crates_aredkpxj7yAre actively preparing to remove features currently in the game and turn them into paid content https wwwredditcomrPUBATTLEGROUNDScomments6ph5xflooks_like_free_cosmetics_are_going_byebye,negative

Game is pretty average Often has random server connection issues initial load time is very long Vehicles roll for little to no reason at times from hitting glitchy ground sections Guns are very inaccurate in full auto mode only semi auto firing mode is worth using The bullet lead and drop is different to any other game you have ever played and feels wrong you shoot way too far in front of people to hit them with bullet travel times of 3 5secondsThis game is only popular as it is the first DAYZ style survival game to release on consoles and consoles are the majority of the gaming market Console players have much lower standards as ignorance is bliss,negative

 Edit   I ve already received quite a few messages from fans trying to argue or just being straight up insulting Let me make this perfectly clear This review is for anyone looking to buy PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds not for someone who already bought the game and is looking through the reviews section to justify their purchase to themselves Bluehole is a multimillion dollar company they don t need you to do their PR for themIf you re the type of person who doesn t care that the lead developer lied and has already gone back on his word twice then that s your prerogative This is a warning to potential buyers to look into the cycle of other Early Access battle royale style games like The Culling that also had a massive popularity explosion then through mismanagement and lies told by the developer now sits at 67 peak players today Edit end They promised there wouldn t be any tournaments until it came out of Early Access yet here they are using the crate money to fund a 350000 tournamentThey promised there would be no microtransactions until it came out of Early Access but they re adding limited time only microtransactions 5 outfits each with about 4 pieces where each crate gives one piece That s 250 each It s 10 for an outfit and that s with perfect luck With a pool of 20 pieces and the ability of getting duplicates this is going to be extremely expensive for a set of virtual clothes in an Early Access gameThey ve pushed the launch back and moved the microtransactions forward,negative
  This is the best game battle royale game i ever play  ,positive
Here s exactly what your match will look like Approximately 1 2 minutes of excitement after jumping out the plane followed by 15 minutes of the most spineless gamers on the internet You at this point have two options sit alongside these other toxic players or try to progress the game and get shot at through a bathroom window Fast forward 20 minutes of literally sitting in one bedroom  because if you didn t someone who was hiding killed you Now the circle is small enough where they actually have to shoot and be moving around At this point the game becomes laughably simple All the spineless hiders start dropping like fliesAll in all  if you enjoy 2 minutes of gameplay followed by 20 minutes of hiding this is your game Shooting mechanics are good though 510,negative

Since Ive played this for 300 hours ima give a positive review Its fun better with friends When you get killed by a number tho for example NA   240  413 or as if its a code not like a name or anything chances are its possibly a hacker Its rare to get killed by hackers or if you made it to top ten maybe u might meet one Ive encountered two hackers when I ve reached top 10 usually in the kill feed ull see it appear multiple times when it kills people Usually a sniper would take two shots to kill someone one to see where the shot goes the other to finally hit its mark But what if a sniper just constantly gets hit with just one shot in the head not a test shot If you died by a number its probably likely a hacker I have yet to encounter hackers in duos or squads,positive

What is Pubg Pubg is a Third person or first person shooter that is about surviving by collecting loot   guns to survive in an 8x8km map 100 people are spawned in a plane and they can choose when and to jump out once the player lands they begin collecting loot   guns once you drop you will be vulnerable to all players so you have to loot fast the game also has a white and blue barrier that closes in the white barrier is a safe spot where you can not die from being outside the playzone the blue barrier closes in on you and you cannot out run it but you can drive away from it with a vehicle if you are lucky enough to find one once the barrier gets small enough you will encounter a lot of players and the game will get tense because the worry of dying to the playzone and the worry that a player will shoot you from the back adds up once it is in the top 5 the circle is basically a death arena and the winner gets a chicken dinner yes you do get a chicken dinner If you are in a duo or a squad if you lose your first health bar your friend has a limited time to pick you up that is if you dont get killed before you can crawl to your teamWhy I like the gameIt s very exhilarating and can bring you and your friends hours of funPubg isn t an easy game to play and will be tough if your starting out but once you learn a few tips and tricks the game gets   fun  especially when you are one of the top 10 surviors,positive

I get my rear end handed to me basically every round and yet I can t help but come back for more Here s why 1 Survival is more important than getting killsThe reason to shoot another player is to avoid being shot oneself rather than to get ranked on the leaderboard at the end This reframes the combat in a fundamental way that makes each encounter carry far more weight Whether it be due to a lucky shot or because of a well executed plan eliminating another player is satisfying in that it is in aid of the further goal of surviving2 Stakes are low in reality but they feel sky highGet killed and you can be back in a new match in a couple of minutes So the actual penalty for dying is not that huge Even if you survive down to the last 10 or 20 players it s only a time investment of perhaps 15 20 minutes But despite these seemingly low stakes my reptile brain kicks into overdrive in the later stages of a match and my tension levels spike to a crazy degree That probably means I m ill suited to being able to win a match but it does make the whole experience quite a rollercoaster ride3 Risk management is a huge facet of the gameAs the play area contracts the decision as to when and where to move is a fraught one with no easy answer Being forced to make those decisions during almost every round is compelling to me When I die it s more often due to bad decision making on my behalf rather than my admittedly mediocre reflexes4 It s very hard for other players to mess with the experienceAt least with the voice chat disabled there is very little anyone can do to ruin the experience for other players With the explicit goal  in solo at least to outlast all 99 other players all just about anything another player can do to you is within the expectations you have going into a round5 A level playing fieldPretty much the only thing you can bring into the game to give you and edge is knowledge and experience No levelling system no unlockable weapons or other gear apart from cosmetic items which may afford some small measure of camouflage that does not bother me,positive

Releasing cosmetic skins for money when blue hole said verbatim  As far as monetization is concerned know that we eventually intend to give the player options to purchase cosmetic items only However until the game is out of Early Access our development resources will be focused entirely on improving the Battle Royale game mode Only then will we consider the addition of in game purchases Until the developers stand by their word and put their community before micro transactions avoid like the plague Bought this game under the impression they weren t another dayz another h1z1,negative

I recommend this game due to following reasonsI recommend this game because me personally love open world battle royale gamesI recommend this game because of the in game action At the beginning they had so much optimization problems but with the updates they  made it a less problem Example I have a Geforce GTX 745 and i was getting around 15 20 fps about a month or two ago But now i can play the game with the average of 45 60 So that you guys out there looking to buy this game and nervous about  If i buy this game can i Play   if you have better GPU than the minimum section yes you canWell let s get in to the negatives of the game  You sometimes have  big fps drops but not a big problem if you enjoy Battle Royal games No good headphones equals no enjoy in this gameWell to me theese are the negative parts for me I highly recommend this game if you are a Battle Royale player I guarentee you will enjoy it Have fun with the game,positive

This is an awesome game especially for it being early access but has some faults here and thereHere are two of them Not having a killcam which is very annoying when you re killedHaving a ranking system so that you fight people who have been playing it as much as you and have just as much experienceOnce again it is in early access but is a great experience for everyone even your parents or eldest kids could play,positive

Early Access Game Expectations Bug Synchronization Delay FPS Problem Even With Lowest SettingsI would still recommend this game for those who would like to try it out with the current hype game to have fun with your friends as a team game even if it s still in Early Access which might have more incoming updates in the future to improve the game itself,positive

I was hesitant to purchase PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS as I am not traditionally a fan of battle royales Although the amassing attention PUBG was gathering peaked my interestWhile the game itself is rather enjoyable I believe Bluehole it s developers are doing a terrible job at administering the game under all the publicity PUBG has gathered For instance Twitch streamers are seemingly being valued by Bluehole over the majority of the user base as evident by the recent  stream snipe bannings  To place this into perspective a Twitch streamer could die and claim  stream sniping  on a completely legitimate kill and the other player would be completely defenseless to argue otherwise This isn t just a hypothetical scenario as it s already been reported to have happened multiple times now PUBG should respect it s Twitch user base yes but they should also stand by their common user base rather than favoring Twitch playersI d also noticed a  PUBG Rules of Conduct  notification in game and after reading through it I d found myself almost baffled It s good that the devs are attempting to keep their game as non toxic as possible however these  Rules of Conduct  were horribly vague and simply ridiculous For example one rule if I recall stated  do not stalk or harass other players  If I m to understand this correctly you are not to stalktrack enemy players in an attempt to kill them or other players that might be drawn to said player s movements  These  Rules of Conduct  appear to contradict the very nature of the gameRegardless the game itself is rather enjoyable and had it not been for Bluehole s actions I would ve left my review positive  Edited to address PUBG s development,negative

Terrible rendering When you jump from the plane and free fall down The grass renders but the buildings dont Kind of lame when everyone can run into a house and grab a gun while you are there just glitching in the walls of buildings and the connection is unstable Terrible gamePoorly optomized Not fun because nothing renders when yo land from the free jump Game freezes all the time Rust is better,negative

great multiplayer game for casual gamers,positive
PUBG is better if you have friends to play with It s more fun with people and kind of boring if alone It s hard to master but easy to learn  basically drop loot and kill Getting a chicken dinner is probably the best achievement you ll get in this game Therefore there are hackers it s quite rare to come across them now as the team in PUBG are eliminating hackers on a daily basis I recommend but only if you have quite a few friends that have it 910,positive
This game is fun but for its survival of the fittest game its not very good in its state currently ive had moments where my vehicle just disappears or i shot someone 2 times point blank in the face with a shotgun and then get killed by three shots from a pistol and die also you are basicly a magnet to bulletsi n this game i have had way too many times where i have been shot through walls and were i am being shot from behind in a car and get a shot to the head in its current state it is a little overpriced if they fix this game i would love it alot more,negative
garbage developers  garbage game,negative
PUBG is an extremely fun game and i personally just cant stop playing it my complaints are as follows  connectivity if you want to make this a full game you need to fix connectivity too often do i find myself in a fire fight and a lag spike occurs to which i cant shoot straight im certain other poeple have this issue  danger when i say danger i mean that i want more my strategy is to avoid confrontation this gets me to the top 20s a lot add animals or rock slides or forest fires stuff to keep players on edge but make it relative to the area animals in the plains and forest rock slides in the mountains forest fires in well the forest perhaps you could make it so that buildings sometimes colllapse in the city after a player hits a gas can it explodes  AOS area of sight the sight of the player is fine but i feel that your team should try to increase a render distance increasing long distance confrontationPUBG is an awesome game and i m planning on playing more after i submit this i cant wait to see the full product of your game and will likely continue to play it until its full release,positive

its a fun game with friends but so annoying when your getting shot from and then you hide behind a tree and then you get shot again so you move to the other side of the tree and then again and again and you die this happens to me 910 can we have an indicator telling us where we get shot from 610,positive
Just like any other early access games It looks horrible and the optimization is abysmal Every time another playeris close to you you can always know Couse the framerate will drop significally I guess it could be fun if it actuallywould run smoothly But it this state It is a piece of horrendous odoring crap,negative
Honestly this is a very good game in my opinion The game maker s ability to listen to the community and actually implement things that matter is a little bit lacking though Although the game is constantly improving I do genuinely enjoy playing this game when I m not getting shot from absolutely nowhere Speaking of the community though this isn t the game for you if you can t handle being called a name or two Or perhaps a million The community is certainly something alright But sometimes the best thing that you can do is just change your voice chat channel to team only It ll save your sanity and your IQ level Anyways this is an amazing game for being Early Access The devs are doing a great job forgetting about their deafness to the community I look forward to seeing the game grow Even if that means hearing more of  I m a snake follow me Take a chance on this one It won t be an investment you ll regret if you enjoy working together with a team in Squad mode or just need some good alone time in Solos But I think we can all agree that if Brian just get s in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Discord everything will be a hell of a lot better  Cheers and good luck  ,positive

Do not buy this game until something is done about the cheating problem which at this point means never  They just released a new 8 man event mode  I played 3 games of it  First game   Guy flying through the air shoots me through a wall from across the map  Second game   Guy running 100mph shoots me through a wall  Third game   Guy locks on to me from across the map and full autos me after killing 10 people  This regularly happens in their 3rd person servers and THEY DO NOT CAREThey  ban  thousands of people when you can gameshare and make a new account for free as soon as you re banned  They are doing nothing about the cheating problem and no one cares cause they re making money,negative

I m re reviewing PUBGThis game is amazing and I could careless about the microtransactions since it does NOTHING to affect gameplay The only thing I hate is the amount of hackers in this game About 25  of the time I go to play a squad we meet some kind of hacker that PEFECTLY gets headshots on us with an M4 from like 400m away And it s only headshots Plus their name is like quad244397542565 or something This games anti cheat is slightly better than VAC but that s not saying much  They also need to stop focusing on the MLG scene and worry about other things like server performance Once this game comes out of early access with the promise of a better anti cheat I ll give this a positive reviewPros I can run this game extremely well with an i7 7700k and GTX 1060 6GB with 16GB DDR4 ram  Those who say they can t run this game with a 1080ti aren t doing something rightWeapons can have attachmentsYou can drive vehiclesGrenades and other melee weaponsYou ll never have the same experience againCons Server side performace is garbage  sometimesWay too many hackersVehicles are kinda buggy when driving through fieldsI give the game a 810 It s fun at times but a lot of hackers are expected when your game has more than 2 million people playing,positive
If you want to spend 30 bucks for running simulator this game is definitely for you,positive
Honestly after watching this game on Twitch I thought it would be REALLY boring since it seems everyone is just looting all the time and it s stupidAfter I tried it out for an hour I was hooked The game s looting system still is sort of boring but you start to understand why loot matters to get good gear to be able to stand against other peoples or squads in firefights since you have enough ammo good scopes extended mags etcIt s a great game that if you play with friends can make you feel very tactical as well as there is a major element of positioning and trying to predict what the other players will do make it super satisfying to trick or bait someone into a building you want them to go or camp a certain door or window It feels really satisfying to kill someone or a squad since there is such a huge pump of adrenalineYou can also just be stupid and troll around too if you don t wanna take it seriously and that can be fun sometimes as wellI also like the way the guns handle The kickback on full auto is great making it realistic where most of the time you are shooting in single shot unless you are very close  like 15 feet and in that case you go full auto I like it since if you try to go full auto and they are far away good luck trying to actually hit them which is similar to real life when you re shooting at a range with ARs and AKs,positive

Very addicting game after you get the hang of it and also easily way better than h1z1,positive
I absolutely love this game There are still some glitchs with textures but other than an occasinal hacker  which is rare now because of their anti cheat I would totally recomend buying this game,positive

The game is not yet optimised for AMD components i m having low FPS even at very low settings i have an FX 8300 42Ghz AMD R9 280 8GB RAM and i still get FPS Drops at very low settings The loot is not very well distributed in some places you get a full set and can dominate the match and in some places you don t find a single gun In my oppinion you should wait for the release i just refunded the game maybe i will buy it when its finished,negative

As it stands now I personally cannot reccommend this game in good faith as the game currently stands Now whether or not the problems that led are my fault or the games fault I am writing this with my experience in the game thus far in mindPros Plethora of weapons and customization Very tactical combat due to Arma heritage Does the  Battle Royale  style of game very well Can go in alone or with friends or play custom games Very pretty environment  should you have the horsepower to use those graphical settingsNeutral You will die a lot due to being surprised ambushed or picked off from someone who is half a mile away and there is nothing you can do about it The controls are somewhat clunky and take a little time to get used to  Thanks Arma The Blue Screen of Death is fast as hell and you better have a good head start or you will be hurting  or dead Cons NOTE  These cons are subjective as I do not know if this happens much to others or not These come from my experience over the 30 hours playtime Your experience may differ from mine Lag I am not sure if they have yet to really get the kinks out server side or it s just my side but LAG is all too prevalent in the game It is frequent and bad enough to bring the flow of the game to a screeching halt and break the immersion On top of this it has led to my death multiple times and having to start a new match without even getting to actually play that round Graphics Now remember how I said that the environment was pretty  Well it can take quite a while to load all of the assets and that can break game immersion too My computer is no slouch either It s a decent machine with a 6th gen i5 8GB of Ram and a GTX960 but the game only runs smoothly on the lowest settings Like the lag the graphics can  and most cases it will halt and freeze the game until it is done loading and can lead to you dying before getting the chance to get going On top of this while loading the assets the buildings look like a 4 year old tried to waterpaint each one but kept sneezing on it with each stroke  StressHO BOY is this game going to stress you out Now to be fair some might enjoy the heart pounding and stress that comes with playing this game but for me it borders on anxeity When you are running around doing well and surviving you feel great When you start having to be careful trying to sneak around everything makes you jump EVERYTHING Then add someone who kills you since they were behind you the entire time and ends it all for you Repeat that 30x and you will forcefully say you need to stop for the day It doesn t feel good This can largely be avoided if you play with friends but if you play solo better start going to the therapist amigoTL DR  The game is good but lag graphical work load and stress ruin it I will update this when these issues are or are not resolved I will also continue playing the game since let s face it I m a game addict at times The stress can be handled with various means on the player side but network lag and the graphical workload need to be optimized before the game can reach its true potential There is a lot to like about the game but the main issues are too big to ignore,negative

Altough it had some flaws and technical issues at the beginning this game is pure fun  especially with a mate or in a squad Solo is interesting as well but PUBG offers its full potential in DuoSquad Mode with friends connected via voice chat Can be frustrating sometimes if lag or desync is messing with you but overall very good value for an Early Access title Hope the devs will continue the great support and I m already looking forward to the vault system and new maps,positive

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Wow this game is terrible I mean seriously Every  deathcam  I ve seen never has them aiming at me it like the bullet physics just auto lock the bullets to hitting you if you have any kind of sniper rifle The hit detection is garbage and doesnt even let you know where you are being hit from let alone the super low health everyone seems to have  20hp WTF even is this Magic the Gathering There isnt even a practice map so you can even get a proper handle on any weapon The map is so huge its like half the Skyrim map and the stupid blue curcle closes way to fast This has to be one of the worst games I ve ever bought I mean this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  isn t even a finished game It s H1Z1 with a fancier skin or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing TF2 given they want more for this pile of Garbage 250 for a key you cant get in game yet I spent 60 on this I wish I could Get my money back and go get Fortnight or something Like COD or something FUN but now I m stuck with this trash DO NOT BUY THIS GAME HUGE WASTE OF MONEY,negative

NICE GAME EVER REAL SURVIVAL GAME LIKE MOVIE THE HUNGER GAMES xD,positive
I really liked this game to begin with have palyed it a lot and think it really opened up the market for BattleRoyale Games That being said it recently became almost unplayable They always patch the game just to bring new skins to sell or new game mods but things like the new map really made the game boring because it is to big for the number of players on it which basically makes the game a running simulator The biggest issue tho are the countless bugs that just keep piling up with new patches and which do not seem to get fixed insted they just have 2gb patches every week only to sell skins At the moment i would not recommend buying this game but would rather recommend Fortnite because it is free to play and it runs a lot smoother,negative
Highly recommended,positive

As someone who has played H1Z1 before and only mediocrely enjoyed my time with it this gave me a lot of hope for the battle royale genre King of the Kill  Please tell me someone got fired for that name was too fast pace with the weapons feeling horribly in my opinion while at the same time not providing much variety either Pubg fixes that The gameplay is slow and strategic team play is rewarding weapons have variety and every single one feels different in one way or the other Attachments only increase that The general feel of the guns is very well balanced compared to H1Z1 but also in general feel heavy powerful and realistic The vehicle are working alright at the moment but feel nice too and provide fun moments Overall I greately enjoy the game and am sure I will continue that behaviour Would recommend to everyone who likes to have fun with their friends or alone with slow and tactical gameplay and realistic guns 911 proudest of faps,positive
Utter LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game This game is only for streamers who wither away in their DXRacer chair cashing in on donations while making the game look actually  Fun  Little do you know that to get a good game you have to travel around the globe collecting these items 4 Leaf cloverLucky DieHorseshoeA rabbits footA dream catcherBecause no way in hell you are going to win a game unless you hang your lucky items around your monitor Cut off your left toe and slit your wrist with lucky 7sWant to go to a place which might have decent loot  Be prepared to battle 80 people for it Only 100 in the game  PUBG does not give a flying LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  there will still  be 80 people there regardless Did i mention you certainly will not pick up a weapon to defend yourself but everyone else will miraculously be loaded with loot from the one building they go toWant to go somewhere secluded where you might not get your backside penetrated well your in luck because you have 2 optionsGet nothingorSomeone already beat you to it even though you clearly saw no one parachute to that area Oh but you must be able to get good stuff and your just over exaggerating  you may say Well thats true you can sometimes have a chance of getting some decent loot But you will be 6 miles away from the zone But don t worry because if you have meds you can buy a home out in stalbar remodel the kitchen Have kids and get a conservatory before you actually have to go back And when you do go back not only will there be people looking outside of the zone to kill the struggling and not actually concentrating on the people inside the zone like they should be The zone does not do its job you can play a full game and not even bother looking at your mapBut you may need a vehicle to go to the zone and guess what 75 percent are broken The non carted bike is supposedly good for stunts but if you don t stay at a perfect 180 degrees horizontal line then your death will surely be met by the fall you will take from getting thrown off your bike at 150 KmhThe dacia What dacia  It s the only semi decent vehicle so you won t find oneThe carted Bike Have fun wheeling around with half the bike glued to the floor and at every jump you take you fall onto a 90 degree angleThe buggy flips at every kurb and kindle of grass that comes in its way And if you get to max speed you get a noise that can be compared to a ford fiesta owned by a uk teenager who may or may not be a qualified chav or a peugeot driver thats too scared to shift gears incase they come to a cornerThe Uaz with a roof is non existant the Uaz without a roof is pretty terrible at saving you from a bulletThe Uaz with a soft top is made  out of paper Yes they wasted time creating 3 diffrent types of UAZsThe boat which does about 1 mile to the gallon if you re luckyQuick pit stop of what i think of the servers and the connection overall HAHAHAHA What a jokeThe pre game lobby is fun you get 1 frame per second on any PC It matches the speed of a consoleAnd if you are unlucky enough to have voice turned on you will be met by a bunch of sand chimps who scream down the mic I M A SNAKE FOLLOW ME In their broken english Sometimes they speak in their own language which is a a mixture of UH EE and AHH AHH Then again it is easy to ammuse such small minded people as they crawl around on the floor and beat each other up just like their ancestorsI have a pretty high end pc 1700 and the game still runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  so you better be prepared to take out a bank loan and a second morgage to afford to run it But don t worry if you have a low end pc and put your graphics to low you will have x ray  powers and be able to see through rocks tree buildings and grass  Not kidding one bitIn the 5 months this  Game  has been out the only noticeable updates areThe Vss a plague to all playersRemoving the Vss from crates The VectorA flippable bike Took them 4 months to fix the stuns that crashed your game when thrown  how that went unnoticed i don t knowThey added some sunset weather that causes you to load the entire map resulting in minus frames per secondAnd some wooden hutsWhich brings me onto my next pointWoodWhy is it that doors and these random huts are penetrable but a every other wood is not Explain to me how a thin plywood tower is bullet proof as well as desks and chairs and a small chain link fence which blockes all bullets coming through regardless of the 5 inch holes and the half inch wireNearly forgot to mention how badly optimised the game is and the fact they still have a rain map just so you can get your daily dose of cancer Should probably worry about the visuals of your game after you fix it But what do i knowHeres a few lighter points to which i wont go into much detailHit registration is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE edDevs do not listen They added a ballistic mask which is cosmetic only and isnt even available in reward cratesITS CALLED A BALLISTIC MASK IT SHOULD HAVE A USELast time i check the creator of PUBG had 11 hours of game time If hes not playing it says alot about why he created the game Cough  CoughIn the PUBG info it says  PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is being developed with full transparency to our players  The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  does it mean by transparency Does this mean players are invisible and they dont care  because it sure does feel that way Whoever wrote that is an idiotFalling 90 feet from a building does not do LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but a pistol shot will one shot youDon t crash your car because chances are you will be a firery wreck shooting across the sky because why fix something like thatThere is a glitch where you don t take damage by the zone  Something tells me this isnt actually a glitch to be honest1 in 5 games you play will have a hacker inWhen falling from the plane everyone else will go 10x faster than you even when looking straight downI could go on for a lot longer about this game and its many many many flaws and how the cons serverly outweigh any benifit of buying this game but i really cbaHeres a couple of links of me getting dickedhttps wwwyoutubecomwatch vBHVMSJeQr whttps

After 150 hours played I feel confident enough in my opinion of this gameIs it a perfect game  No it is not but as of right now it is the best existing game for the battle royale genre which much better netcode and gunplay core mechanics than H1Z1 and more depth than others The gunplay is quite realistic the guns sound exactly as they should sound adjusts itself dynamically to the distance it has been fired from The bullet drop takes a very important place in the game and is consistent along with a gun given effective range The gunplay mechanics overall are pretty consistent avoiding the frustrations of a bug related lossThe gun variety is definitely there you will rarely end up with the same weaponry every game unless looting multiple bodies This forces the player to adjust to the loot and is exactly what makes the charm of this game In PUBG everything is about adapting to the situation the zone shrink cannot be predicted to an exact perimeter the loot cannot be predicted the outward movements of other players can be anticipated but not predicted This whole makes for a unique and different experience every single gameThe community is fairly great so far toxicity levels are low compared to most multiplayer pvp games I have played I have very rarely assisted to team killing even in random teams nobody will T Bag your bodyWhile graphics and optimization are not at their best yet the gamer did make some major improvements over time with developpers being transparent about their work releasing weekly patch notes with bug fixes new features etc Obviously for those looking for the best graphics and the best performance then this game is definitely not for you Surround sound implementation is  fine  as of right now While it may not be the best I have ever seen you are still able to tell roughly where a close enemy is moving from around you using surround sound as well as hear vehicules and shots from afarOverall for it s price you are getting a lot of hours of gun it is only fair that I would recommend this game,positive

so lets do the math 5 million copies sold at 30 a pop thats 150000000 in their pocket not including the money from investors so valve takes 30  on all purchases so that leavs them with 145500000 SO tell me why after 5 months being on steam the servers are worse than ever even say there is an issue with the networking on their part and has nothing to do with usuing amazon servers then they can more than afford to hire people to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fix that but i guess hiring a whole new team to work on the console ports is far more important,negative

I am giving this game a positive review based on my experience so far There have been latency issues frame rate issues terrain glitches and what I assume are 3rd party mods that have all in some way led to my untimely demise as I ve ventured the 8x8 kilometer island These are typically the types of things that quickly push me away from a game however the retrospective after a few weeks has taught me that the good outweighs the bad in many ways It s been some time since I ve played a game worthy of the stories I walk away from this one with      I constantly find myself rambling on with my friends who are playing the game about a frying pan kill just before the other person had time to load their handgun in the beginning of the match or the random passerby that I nailed with my car on the way to the middle of the circle Stories about the perfect load out that I lost because I wasn t paying attention to the circle of death closing in on me or how my duo came in first in a match because we found the perfect camouflaged bush that gave us the prime advantage in the end Some stories are exciting some aren t but I can t seem to stop telling them which means that in the end I must be enjoying the game on some level When I am playing a solo match and there are only 5 people left it feels like years are ticking off of my life It s extremely suspenseful stressful and fun I think these all make the game worth the investment      I believe in the full release with new maps the potential of new weapons and other various features that this game will be even better than it is now But even if they were to close up shop I feel like I ve gotten my money s worth Yes there are games that end with me complaining about 100 things like luck lag hackers cheaters and everything else but it feels like that s commonplace in so many games now Unlike those other games however even when I lose due to any of the issues listed above I still find myself hopping in another match and having a blast,positive
This game is not without its flaws When things are bad they re really bad But when things are good they re amazingThe action is tense quick and unforgiving It s thrilling exhilarating and gratifying The bugs that get in the way are slowly but surely being worked on and for every moment that an issue or bug pops up and frustrates me I have dozens more that are pure intense fun,positive

Honestly I think they should fix all the issues with it currently rather than try to spam content and apps to catch up or compare with Fortnite  Hackers are still a huge problem game still pretty glitchy with bugs everywhere  Hits don t register still pretty laggy hacker game of the year  get killed by other people when they can t see you but I guess ping wins the game  They are trying to fight fortnite for money thats all it is and in turn aren t paying attention to the real issues  Fortnite wouldn t be such a problem if this game wasn t so broken as it stands  The servers are STILL a problem I might add you get disconnected consistently even when in games  Almost after every game you get disconnected and have to fight the server to reconnect  To add on we lost the weather which I thought was awesome and added an extra feel to the game  I still enjoy the game and play it with friends however this game is slowly going to hell  Its no longer about the PLAYER it s about the MONEY  Devs need to get out of their pockets and back into this game fix it get rid of the hackers clean up your servers THEN add new content and focus on competition with other games  Getting killed by a mile away with a grenade and the servers kicking you out after every match is a little old now since this  is a fully released game now Hits do not even register even if its a direct hit and there is blood the game gives you a middle finger  Game is pretty broken as it stands and I wouldn t spend that amount of money on this game in its current condition  It is sad to see how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PUBG is becoming ever since other developers came out with similar games I play this game often but recently it is unplayable with some BS happening EVERY game with one of the many issues it currently has  I mean cars blowing up when you nudge a fence that you can ram through anyway   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing wasted 30 minutes of my life and all that effort gone thanks As I said it isn t about the player it is about the addons and the money  Don t give them the satisfaction just go play fornite or one of the many other battleground related games,negative

Winner Winner Chicken DinnerPlayed for only 1 hour or so but I can already feel that I am gonna love this gameYou see it has that feeling of both thrll and funPROS Developed with community feedback Made by Brendan Greene  BR  Arma 2 Mod  Good looking   fresh graphics  Unreal 4 Engine Acceptable ingame balance so far  eg weapon spawns Good reward system  Still in progress Simple but effective weapon variety and customization No random spawn you  decide  where to land on an massive 8x8 km island Work hard against cheater Battle Eye forum and algorithm demo search Very good   smooth menu guidance  Highlight matching parts Early access game yes   but core mechanics of the game are 99  solidCONS For some people performance needs to improve  But they are working on it Movement animation looks sometimes bit strange  Maybe because of lags  Hitboxes sometimes doesn t fit  Lags  Some distance graphic bugs which can cause advantages  eg shoot trough not loaded treesstones Sometimes the start of a match is unplayable laggy Overall one of the best Buy it now if you can but if you can t buy it atm then save money for the full version which will be much more lag free with more better graphics,positive

What I like best about this game so far is that everyone starts on an even playing field The mechanics are relatively easy to grasp and the good weapons  armor aren t behind a grinding or pay wall that makes the game a chore In theory anyone can get the best guns and gear right off the bat if they re luckyThat and the learning curve isn t annoyingly high I haven t really played PC shooters in years and was able to make it to 4 by around the 10th matchI m having a blast so far,positive

Constant bugs My computer can run any other cpu intensive game  that I ve played on it smoothly  I looked for a fix for a new bug where I can t ADS half the time with no help on the issue  it raises the gun half way and doesn t ADS  Servers are too busy at least half the time I try to log in and the game is supposed to be final released version  All these basic issues for a game that s made roughly a billion dollars,negative
there are too many cheaters to enjoy the game that and they need to get control of their servers the na server is over flowing with people from china so if you ever want to join a group of people you wont be able to understand them not to mention they added microtransactions for this unfinished game,negative

Even with some of the glitchiest bug filled gameplay I ve ever seen this is one of the most fun gaming experiences I ve ever had Get a couple of friends and you could easily play for hours without noticing Not to mention that the matchmaking is pretty much instant and you get free steam items that can be sold on the market for just playing the game Once the bugs are fixed this could very well be the game of the year for me,positive
It was good until this most recent update with the bug fixes I was sitting inside a little shack and some dude comes in and i start plowing him with bullets Literally shot him point blank with a full clip from an ump and he shoots me 3 times and i die  Something happened with the last patch that killed hit detection and its been laggy ever since,negative
Brief synopsis  You parachute down onto the battlefield and have to scavange quickly for gear and a weapon Then like hunger games you kill the other 99 players hoping to be the ONE to survive A circle restricts game areas and gets smaller as the time goes by If caught outside of the area you slowly take damage until you die It s only one map but the replay value of where you drop in what weapons you end up with where the other players drop are all key Then surviving is entirely different You only get one life so make it count I recommend starting off in a squad to learn the buttons before you just roll into a game solo and get repeatedly killed  it s easy to get frustrated but the payout is worth it Knowing when to move when to fight and when to let people pass is all important but knowing how to shoot is a skill in its own    UPDATE    Hackers have taken over the servers Until this is fixed although this is my favorite game on steam it needs to be fixed 710 games a night with hackers is unacceptable This can be fixed by either a Making items untradeable  but not profitable for bluehole or b Putting all new accounts with less than 300 full games into seperate servers This way the hackers with new accounts are only fighting eachother saving the rest of the players from the punishment It wont stop all of them but it will certainly slow the hoard of chineese hackers They talked about banning China for a while since studies show 95  of them are buying the game going to internet cafes  and selling crates for profit and making alot of money in doing so I love this game but the developers are concously ignoring this problem,negative
Awesome FPS very addicting You need to have a good PC optimization is really not that great But that is to be expected game is still in early access If you like FPS games try it,positive
Fun game Combat is smooth however it sometimes comes down to luck in the endgame  for example who has the best cover when the circle closes Looting can take a while at times but usually you ll have some fun fights when doing so  Playing solo can get boring really quickly once overplayed so I recommend you have some friends to squad up with from time to timeOverall the monthly updates are nice pvp is smooth and the game is worth your timeI m giving this a 810 due to the updates but I feel like the endgame battles come down to who the circle favors,positive
This game is absolutely riddled with cheaters and teamkilling ChineseIt s to a point where cheating is an expected part of the game  I honestly think that people cheat just so they can even the odds which in turn is creating more cheatersYou can tell by the way people behave  Instant headshots running around killing people in the open not worried about taking cover carrying crappy guns and getting loads of kills  Even just watching the kill notifications you ll easily see some people get 10 kills per match   almost every match  And if you know anything about this game you d know that its not a noob friendly game  It really does require some skill at FPSsurvival gamesI ve played hundreds of hours of games like COD DayZ and many other similar titles and I m pretty good  So either there are people who are so good at video games that they should be serious professional gamers or there s a serious cheating problems plaguing this game  I m going with the latter,negative
This game is garbage It should not even be released yet  Fix the unoptimiszation and make sure your trashy game has most of the bugs removed before you release it you dirty Bluehole scumbags  Your game is even worse then Ark  Survival Evolved and thats really saying something LOVE LOVE LOVE  you bluehole whenever i get shot at i lag you worthless LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s fix your gay LOVE LOVE LOVE   game  so it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing runs you goddamn pieces of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE REGION LOCK CHINA,negative

I hate this game Well I hate that this game gets to be as popular as it is when crashing hacking gliching and a toxic community I gave this game more than enough time to impress me and it never really did Yes with friends it s just a cluster of random garbage but can be fun only if you re bored When the game gets more proper fixes and hacking becomes less of a frequent problem then I will be content,negative

So much fun thats it,positive
This game is alot of fun but it has some drawbacks Most of the time when I play with friends we run around and gather up a bunch of supplies and its almost more of a survival horror than an fps but its still alot of fun Solo play and duo play are a similar experience The problem in this game is honestly the shooting portion which I m sure a bunch of people will just call me a noob and move on but its pretty frustrating at the moment The bulk of its problems can most likely be attributed to being an early access game but its still frustrating to stand 6 feet from a guy and shiit him with a shotgun because he doesn t know your there and somehow it misses and then the next game you try the same shot from five times the distance and it hits It s a lack of consistency that is honestly annoying They ll probably smooth it out over time but its kinda iffy right nowOverall this is a damn good game the shooting mechanics will improve but it s fun even with kinda wonky mechanics Would definetly recommend buying it,positive
You know the game is bad when the devs have to sue rivals who let them use UE4 for making a better game than them,negative

The lack of a progression system and no goal to work for make the game pointless to play Even when I win I feel as though I did nothing with 30 min of my time when another game I could have unlocked something progressed my character but no I just got some coins that i can buy an RNG case with  n i c e  It is also extremely unrewarding to win most of the time I win I have  3 kills and I just hid and survived I didn t have to do any critical thinking to take out the other players or progress my skill with aim or positioning i just got a lucky kill or a few and if I die it hardly feels as though and more skilled player killed me either it s completely random or I killed myself with the physics YOU DIE IF THE CAR IS MOVING ANY BIT WHEN YOU EXIT The controls feel horrible and clunky The aiming and hit reg is nonexistent The look of the game is subpar for 2017 The map is not lively either nothing interesting no where interesting to go on the map and you are ultimately penned in to the restricting  electricity  zone Playing 2 player is extremely pointless with the amount of RNG in the game Most duo sessions lasted a few min until the first person dies the one alive more often than not just left the game this is because if your partner dies quickly they are forced to just sit and watch a potential 20 min match when the point of starting a game was to play and work together its stupid to either watch them play or have them watch you play because both then lose interesting in that match immediately The solo mode is equally boring and lonely you have no team and no communication to other players  in game VOIP or we its called is unusable and no interaction other than shooting on site In a squad of 4 is the only playable option  if it had one because you can minimally work together even tho areas don t contain enough loot for a squad then causing it to breakup most likely making the squad point well pointless Sadly the best place this game performs is only on twitch where people can yell and act surprised by the RNG not much ever happens each game so its easy to watch for unknowledgeable players The skill gap is non existent  which is what they want to sell more copies to more people there is little advantage to progressing personal skill or map knowledge because someone new to the game will be hiding in a building camping All in all I believe this game is massively over hyped yes its a game but is it a good game that stands up to competition no Ultimately this game is ok for someone unskilled at video games and wants to get the experience of a game somewhere in the difficulty range from go fish to solitare It is not worth the 30 maybe 20 AT THE MOST  mind you this is a game with one game mode and no progression Just save your money for now  I AM 100  AWARE THAT IT IS EARLY ACCESS AND 1005 EXCITED TO SEE THE POSSIBLE AND HOPEFUL TRANSFORMATION THE GAME WILL HAVE UPON RELEASE AND CANNOT WAIT TO PLAY IT AT THAT TIME and watch a random twitch streamer and you will have your fill of this game,negative
Really good battle royal game i would say 100  its worth the 30,positive
Outshines The Culling H1Z1 and every other BR experience you ve had to date and it may be one of the only games to use early access correctly I m not the biggest fan of BR games due to some of the other titles  shortcommings but PUBG has done a lot to speed up the gameplay and make the gunplay rewarding yet approachable Highly recommended,positive
This game is like a horrible pizzaplace which is the only pizzaplace in your neighborhood Sometimes you get what you ordered sometimes it is burnt sometimes you get shot in the face through the wall You still order pizza from it because there is no other pizzaplace nearby to offer this experience that you love so much But after 300 orders I am fed up with how they have promised better dough But they just keep adding new toppings on the pizza and different cheeses The dough of the pizza is still filled with rat poison and paperclips and all kinds of messed up stuff Sometimes it is the best dough that is thick and filling and you tell all your friends about it And even dream about it sometimes But it gets far and few between every time you experience this amazing feeling and now you have to either move or do something else with your life,negative
Just H1Z1 with allot of mak up,negative
Never done a review before But although i love this game the amount of cheats and hackers is insane untill they sort this out sadly i do not recommend,negative
Russian kids shouting racial slurs hackers massive maps with a lot of cucking potential and on the top of that this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in a suit made out of leaves that somehow got his hands on an AWM and a x8 scope just to quickscope across the map I love and hate this gameDefinitely worth the price and I don t regret playing it since early access,positive
This game his its flaws but it is a great game,positive

There are 2 big downsides this game has why i write this review in hope the developers may read this1st  Zone shrink Speed Mostly there are 2 scenarios happening First you are in the Zone all the time and have an easy round with a really high win chance Second one is you chase the Zone for 90  of the game and most likely get shot from someone who hasnt to runThe lack of Tactic and Skill needed in the second scenario is frustrating You cant drive into the last zones cause everyone will notice and shoot on you You dont have time to think about stuff like from which side i want to go in the zone maybe take highround or other tactical thinking like positioning from others where the shots were from and so onIf the Zone always spawns on max distance you just stupidily run for your life so you make it in the zone before it kills you I wish the last few zones have a lower shrink speed so you can really fight tactical2nd  Squad loot Most fun is this game alone or in Duo matchmaking Squad would be a lot more fun if the Loot is more balanced 60  of the games you aint find a scope better than 2x zoom 40  of the game you find 3 4x zoom or better in one house If you dont rush big cities as a squad you mostly have 2 3 Members of your team with no scopes or good long range weapons which means they are not being able to efectively shoot on someone except in house fights or really late game decreases the fun of the RoundIf you rush big cities you most likely will lose one or more of your team which decreases the fun of teamplay again                    Beside these 2 points and some rare Hack user the game is really fun So i recommend the game and hope the 2 points above may get improved,positive
WELL,positive
Why is this game so popular Honestly I ve been asking myself this question with increasing frequency as of late I ve sunk about 80 hours into the game at this point yet I couldn t honestly tell you with a straight face that I think it s a  good  game The people I play with on a regular basis all have considerable experience with shooters ranging from above average to semi professional in skill level  and the general consensus amongst them is that the gun play is bad The hit registration is mediocre The environments have genuinely atrocious hitboxesOn top of this the movement mechanics are also pretty lacklustre   it s extremely easy to get stuck on or in objects and your characters ultimate kryptonite is apparently knee high walls Furthermore the game is not only ugly but incredibly poorly optimised Unless you re running the sort of rig that wouldn t look out of place on the goddam Starship Enterprise be prepared for some slideshow gaming here and thereSo why has it sold 3 million copies  Well in my mind it comes down to one major factor   there is a huge void in the market for accessible pick up and play co op games   especially for those looking to get some sort of PvP fix I mean what are your alternatives  MOBA s specialize in destroying friendships rather than fortifying them and MMORPGs are about as good for you as a crack habit   but PUBG  The games are quick the atmosphere is relaxed and the game is conceptually extremely simple to graspIf you re one of the twelve people left out there who have not yet purchased PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS I d honestly tell you to hold onto your money at 30USD a pop  the overwhelming technical issues and mediocre gameplay  just can t justify the pricetag at this point in time  but let s be honest Bluehole Studios have already made more money than God at this point in time so who really gives a toss what I have to say on the matter,negative
Play area kills me more than other soldiers many games are spent chasing a blurry blue wall then getting killed by it unless i luck out with a vehicle that doesnt flip over on a few pebbles in the dirtPros   Large Community Variety of Weapons Equipment   Vehicles Quick Match Making Sound Quality is great Adrenaline Pumping SituationsCons  heavy on cpu usage so many of you may struggle on higher settings even though you have a BADA   GPU Randomly Crashes to desktop at times  Think it s Cpu Overload on my 6700k Midnight 7am central time typical to see Overload of high ping users on NA Server  May be what s causing lag bringing up my inventory menu at times Jumping   Melee Mechanics Could use polishing especially over obstacles like half broken walls small fences etc Shrink zone is a bit much at times It s a cool concept but could use a little polishing on timing and health loss maybe longer countdowns and less health loss at the end UI bugs make you constantly have to refresh the menu Servers get overloaded on the weekends and you cant connect half the time,negative
Take your piggybank money out and buy this right LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in now this game may give 7 types of cancer and 3 heart attacks a day but its all worth it to kill someone with a pan and caress their body for all their spoils 43710 makes me wanna jump right back into the beloved reich again from god ol hitlers time  ,positive
Its a very great game But it s poorly optimized aswellI am literally able to drive through buildings because they have no collision for some reason when they haven t loaded yet which happens very oftenSo I would give a 1310 Would overrun people with my nonexisting collision car building combo again,positive

The game is really fun lie the gameplay is tight but im giving it a negative reivew due to its very poor optimazation they need to fix this its getting out of hand with lag and network problems Also the game was crashing for the 1st hour of gameplay its a great game just it needs to be better with time if we see a good fix for these problems ill switch this reivew to positive and gush about how good is the gameplay still get it just be warned,negative

This game has had horrible desync issues for about a month now This is especially bad because the game is OUT OF EARLY ACCESS The crates are oversaturated and as of recently  it feels like they are straight up selling you cosmetics only to make a quick buck because the developers know they can t keep up with the game  so they might as well cash out while they can Now they go and start some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t copyright lawsuit against Epic Games instead of fixing their broken LOVE LOVE LOVE  game But hey at least the mobile port works,negative

Very fun game Great multiplayer Haven t had this much fun in a whileGraphics   810  Very pretty but unless you have a mammoth computer the great textures come at the cost of lag which can get you killed Even the low res textures are pretty goodAudio   910  Foley is very good Guns sound as you would expect them to Able to hear distant gunshots cars driving up people opening doors in the house you re in Very good very atmosphericGameplay   910  Very realistic shooter Easy to learn difficult to master One big map with many varied locations to choose from collect gear to kill other players and be the last one standing You have very little health  2 or 3 Assault Rifle bullets will do it and have to travel to the center of a circle that gets continually smaller without getting picked off by the other players trying to do the same thing Play with friends you won t regret your purchase Full price or on sale definitely worth it,positive
Great game I have played h1z1 before this and I doubt I will go back This game has 10x the amount of content that h1 has with many differant sights chokes grips quick draw having the choice to where you want to go anywhere on the map unlike h1 and the graphics are 20x better  if you have the computer to run it I had also played h1z1 for 20 hours and barely cracked the top 10 once  which was me hiding pretty much the entire game and with this game as you see I only have 9 hours and have made the top 10 twice as a solo and about 5 times with a group of my friends with 2 chicken dinners  which is getting 1st if you re not familiar If you are looking between h1z1 and this game 100  get this game,positive

Good Game tho,positive
Probaly some of the worst servers ever lagging as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
This is a great game that is definitely worth the price By far the best early access game i ve played that being it is still EARLY ACCESS The game has a few different bugs and some spots on the map that are more laggy than others however the mechanics and design of the game are near flawless On the other side this game is more directed towards playing with friends in my opinion Solo can be very frusterating and more difficult to learn everything to do However they designed the game in a way that allows you to still search for a squad game even if your alone I highly reccommend this game due to the fact that its one of the only games that most of the time I don t blame this game for my death   Although I truly do wish they would increase some of the vehicle spawns because when you have to attempt to run across the map to the circle in search of a car on the way and than you die by playzone NOTHING is more aggrivating ,positive
I believe I have enough hours in to give a review so here it goesBugs  I ve found two issues One is after a match I never go back to the main menu It just hangs at the background and I have to End Task The other is lagging out I think the servers may be crashing out because in twos it happens to both of us It starts lagging bad then kicks us outGuns  like everything so far but haven t had enough time to fully get a feel Attachments are awesomeCars  love all the vehicle spawns easy to find and not OPLoot Balance  in KOTK I can loot 5 houses in the time I can loot one or two in PUBG Sometimes I will go to 4 before I find a backpack andor helmet It would be nice if the loot was tweaked I feel like KOTK is more geared around giving an advantage to who gets good stuff and PUBG is more geared to give advantage to those that are more tactical and cautious I don t thing RNG has a place in this gameGameplay  everything is smooth I love it Looting feels natural and weaponsattachments are cool I get very bored mid game however Everyone just goes in a building and hides In two games I drove all over the circle twice and never seen anyone or got shot out Eventually I seen a person in a window They hid once I stopped I ve only made it to the end twice because I get bored and start rushing housesI don t know how to solve my major complaint I don t want any major rule changes maybe some sort of incentive to get out and about but not necessarily any kind of penalty I don t like penalizing a play style but it would be cool if there was a reason that made u want to get outIt s easy to say  don t go in houses mid game  but damn I get bored after sitting around a few minutes Earlier I stopped in a car in the middle of the circle for about 3 minutes Went and made a margarita and I was still alive Any other game I would have died the second I stopped,positive
The game has come in leaps and bounds in the last six months It is nearing full release and the game is definatly worth it,positive
Buildings refuse to load constant network lag at the start of the match massive gunplay lag and various other bugsoptimixation issues that should ve been fixed by now but of course the game devs had to add microtransactions and other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t instead of fixing the game,negative
570 Hours in and I loved this game it was incredibleNow in Jan 2018  100  of games have been hacked and cheatedThe game is ruined and the developers need to do somethingIts not fun it s frustrating every death is now questionable  Unless the devs fix it I can not recomend it,negative
Instantly hooked 1010 would ruin life again,positive
This game is amazing with friends and still fun solo If you like the tactical realism of Arma 3 and the battle royale of h1Z1 then you will love this game Every month they have updates to fix bugs add new items while also optimizing   Pros   Great GraphicsHard Working DevelopersEasy to learnHard to masterlots of replayability   Cons   Poorly Optimized  for nowAnnoying gun handling  Very hard to learnLots of Salty people  Including Me,positive

This game reminds me of Socom I and Socom II from back in the day Bursts of intense action followed by moments of silence anxiety and panic as you hear gunshots in the distance This is one of the greatest games I ve played in a very long time and it will only get better over time,positive

Played this game for nearly 60 hours and have won 1 game I can t stop playing it,positive
 IMPORTANT  THIS USUALLY ONLY OCCURS IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 7 WINDOWS 10 USERS SHOULD BE OK OK so when I first got this game I was expecting for loads of fun hours upon hours of playing every day And I did know that people were having trouble launching the game but almost every game has that small group of people that cant launch the game So I took it as nothing and bought the game It didn t launch So I did the norms restarted computer unistalled game and reinstalled verified integrity still would just say running for a few seconds and then dissapear So I went to google Apperently there is a suprisingly LARGE group of people that have the same exact problem I spent a good 3 hours on google trying fixes updates and reinstalling things but I still have the same problem So I don t think you should buy this game just yet You might be part of that group of people that cant play the game,positive
once you can get past the many many many bugs its a pretty fun game,negative
Bad customer service I bought this game on december and i only spent 7 hours on it Tried to refund it the day after i bought the game but they decline cause i played more than 4 or 5 hours on it not sure Most of the hours I spent on this game was towards finding the right settings and trying to optimize the game In the end my PC could not handle it,negative

At first I didn t like this game and was going to get a refundNow I wish I had taken the refund I die and die from little kids hidding in toilets or hiding behind rocks They only use the double barrel shotgun and I get killed 1 hit Armour on the game is pointless as wearing a plastic bag over your head and torso they literally do NOTHING In addition to all this bullcrap the framrate on that game is worse than me trying to play witcher 3 with my potato computer they really need to fix that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE All in all it s sorta grown on me and I have come to enjoy the game somewhat I rate 88 Dean,positive
Started off a little rocky gets better with age It felt really clunky when I first started playing and reminded me of a typical Arma style game where its cluttered and laggy After some optimization I have been hooked ever since Pretty competitive and similiar to H1Z1 I love this game,positive

Think H1Z1 but with competent game devs and this time it s actually fun This game is Amazing Whether you play with a freind a group of friends or solo you are still bound to have a good time This is a perfect example of a battle royale stlye game done right The adrenaline rush you get from being in the top ten is unrivaled by any other game I have yet to play Other than being a perfect example of a battle royale game done right this is also a perfect example of an early access game done right Unlike every other early access game this one has competent game devs updates that actually fix problems in game and developers who listen to the community For example the community says they don t like the current jumping mechanic in response to that the game devs show us their progress on the new vaulting and climbing mechanics It s so rare to not only find game devs that genuinely care about the players and the community but that actually listen and implement their feedback into their game too Overall for a 30 dollar price tag this game is a bargain and I definetly suggest you pick it up if you are able to Thank you,positive
The Chinese player base with all it s toxicity and hackers has flooded to the American servers and simply makes the game not fun at all If that chinese teammate of yours finds out you re American he ll either cuss you out or TK you Simple as thatI shouldn t have to be amazed if all my teammates speak english on American servers This game is fun but not when the community is a cesspool of hate and hacking Not to mention optimizationAs people say  China ruins everything Callmearacist10,negative

I have to rewrite this whole review becuase after some thinking i ve come to the conclusion this game is a solid 6 12 out of 10 My reason for this is because I think at least 200 HOURS OF THIS GAME I WAS JUST LOOTING AND WALKING AROUND Seriously only buy this game if you have friends to play with because it can be so boring solo The reward system just doesn t feel at all well rewarding the reason for this is because if you get lets say 7 kills and a win you only get about 1000 POINTS I mean I suck and I proabably can t even buy one loot box with that sh t I mean shroud got 34 kills in one game and only got 1600 POINTS why can t he get 10000  Lets talk about the mid game oh wait this game doesn t have any because everybody just camps in houses then LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hits in the final few cirles but its already been 20 minutes so whats the point Ok so why the positive review  Because the game has its moments you will never have in any other game and is just too addictive Did I enjoy those many hours  I mean I could have learned a new skill and done something with my life but i ll just play a trash game instead thanks,positive

Battle Royal at its best   3PUBG   H1Z1 period the number of  support and the optimization patches it recieves is well over any hi end devs can ever giveone of the very best experiences you can ever have a must buy steam game playerunknown nailed it   3 910,positive
Awesome game would definitly recommend it Fun to play with friends and even solo but it can be frustrating sometimesNeed good a PClaptop to run this game on high fps the optimization right now isn t the best but they re improving it alot so thats getting better and better Overall this game is alot of fun and i definitly recommend it Loads of weapons You can unlock crates by just playing Character customization Big map  they re adding another one They re updating it quite alot wich is very good Its an awesome game,positive
I have hundreds of deaths in Battlefield CoD or even game such Loadout But this game still manages to give me plenty of stupid deaths1 Jump out of the plane arrive on one of the buildings roof a glitch happened then I slipped fell down to the ground I ran inside seconds later I died from falling2 Jump out landed on a wrecked car stuck there for minutes until someone saw me and I bet he laughed then he killed me3 Jump out there were no buildings but I saw items floating tried to get one of two then suddenly building shows up I stuck in a wall then dead from falling4 Manage to the TOP 3 I was laying down on rice fields suddenly I sneezed and accidentally stood up dmn  they shot me dead5 Jump out the server got lag and all the buildings look like a melted chocolate wait for 4 minutes then rushed to go inside a building I got a pan then theres a guy with a shotgun so do the math6 Developer updated the game yeay I got to ride a bike go to maximum speed and theres a small bump ahead I and bike do stunt together I landed with my head along its level 3 helmet dead from falling  oh come on7 Ride a bike another bump ahead and I slowed it down success for not doing a stunt Suddenly theres a car landed on my head from behind Another unpredicted death Come OnYesterday I experienced that I could see the map much more clear than ever before No melted buildings or stuck on a roof anymore The developer really did their homework day by dayThere are plenty of updates going on and still I came back and look forward another stupid careless deaths in this game It is not a pay to win game You can win based on your skill or your luck I was lucky once to win the matchGreat game anyway ,positive

this game is pretty SOLID,positive
I left my original review for transparency and it helps explain my conclusionThis game had great potential but every change that occurred was too little too late The  potential  was squandered or lost as Bluehole Landscaping Group raked in cash The lag and FPS issues were fixed nearing the decline of the player base the console port was atrocious  which gave Fortnite a free kill in the console arena the anti cheat updates were implented WELL after servers were full of aimbots for months and finally Regions were never locked as of writing this Bluehole had a chance to fix this but was too distracted by money PUBG died with Forsen ban and Doc DramaORIGINAL A very cool game with lots of fun value and a steep learning curve Could do well to improve some of its stuttering network issues and  sometimes wonky controls but overall completely worth the price tag Games are nearly instantaneous with this massive playerbase 810 for great potential and fun value,negative
This game was really cool when I first downloaded it Every patch it gets worse and worse Now it crashes about once out of every 4 games I play I have uninstalled and reinstalled and there is no change They just keep making it worse POSEdit  Latest patch has made server latency worse somehow and also now guns don t work correctly I love getting killed because my gun is on auto but decides it s going to just stop shooting after 1 or 2 rounds Seriously they just keep breaking things,negative
Its a nice game Not well optimised but its as expected for an early access game,positive
Chicken Dinners are illusive not worth the effort and yet impossible to get out of my mind  1010,positive
this game is very good like good like much fun with friends,positive

Just wow,positive
Wow This game It is so boring There is no action So slow I fall asleep on the plane ride Everything takes forever I collect stuff and wait for someone to come get me This is the most american game ever Sit with your gun and wait I d rather play Fortnite or Lego Island,negative
I cannot recommend this game in it s current state It runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Performance issues aside this game is a lot of fun I will probably buy it again once they have optimised the game and fully released it Looting menu is clunky and slow for a game touted to be fast pacedGunplay is amazing though,negative
NEEDS BETTER ATTACHMENT OTHER THEN THAT LOVE THIS GAME ,positive
Awesome game and since the latest patch the game runs extremely smoothly and th gameplay is overall just super fun,positive
If you wanted DayZ with slightly better optimization and a quicker time to entry without the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  zombies then this game is for you If you want a fun 3rd person shooter to kick around on with friends this is for you However if you don t like early access this game ISN T for you Somewhat buggy and still many things to add Well worth the cost so far however,positive
 3 Nice GAMEGreatGame,positive
Great game Game updates are fairly regularly game for the most part functions as intended despite being in a pre release buildMatchmaking to find a match takes seconds and the game runs smoothly on Ultra on my 970Can t wait to see what else they add the the game If you have friends that are willing to play this game with you then don t wait and get it now,positive

Welcome to  Where is this guy shooting me from      where 20 mins of your life spent looting goes poof with only 1 shot of a Kar98k that apparently saw you from 20 miles away but it doesnt matter because maybe next game you ll get that chicken dinner next game for sure Maybe you ll get a cargo drop with an AWM waiting for you inside to shoot the last guy remaining next ga  nope you got headshot right at the start but it doesnt matter because maybe next gameThis game is perfect if you want to hear people screaming memes or play their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  music at the beggining of all your gamesguaranteed fun whether it may be the cars sent flying for no apparent reasons the snipe of 15 km you nailed the guy you ran over with your dune buggy tons of fun are awaiting in this game1210 would buy again,positive

Winning the game means nothing Most of the time you sit there for 30 40 minutes to get shot by a guy that is sitting around a cornerGame boils down to RNG luck and campingIf that interests you then by all means get after it,negative
Game is full of obvious ESP cheaters On top of the obvious cheaters on the enemy team I ve had a few teammates who don t even try to hide the fact they re using cheats We land and they call out every weapon in each house and know where every enemy is even when there s no possible way they could know Will change if they decide to ban cheaters,negative

Great game have had plenty of fun playing it had a binge with my cousin played for about 15 hours straight ended up over heating my pc had to order LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to set up water cooling  just because i want to continue playing this game 1010,positive
Alright game overall is alright If you have friends it is pretty fun at times Do you need to be good at aiming to win at this game  Absolutely not you can suck big time and do what most people who play this game do sit in a hut in the white or in tree line and camp it up If you are going to shoot someone prepare for some of the worst registry known to man i feel like this is like a 16 tick server or something Then other times youll play and your shots count way more than it should Same applies to someone shooting at you theyll mow you down and youll somehow be standing then next game youll get shot twice and are down from a low caliber gun Would I recommend this game in its current state  Yes and No Yes if you have friends to play with like Battle Royale type games enjoyed H1Z1 and want to kill Summit Otherwise for gameplay or it being a  good  game I would NOT recommend it Registry sucks all around dont bother punching anyone its a total hit and miss One super man punch and youll practically KO someone another one and you do no damage The pan is king which is ridiculous I am more of a machete guy Also most guns take 762 go figure,negative
looting is more fun than shooting do NOT fire your weapon,positive
Addictive yet infuriating but so much fun,positive

prosfun at timesregular updatesbig mapOptions of first or or third person servers  I find first to be bettercons shotguns are inconsistent  shoot someone in the head with shotgun and get nothing but shoot someone in the balls you get an instant kill 1010 hitboxes horrible rng  mostly with the circle and the loot wont let you in matches sometimes  just gives logo and never loads devs don t seem to care about patching bugs as much as making money off of skins and esports whent eh game most definatly is not esports readyTo some it up good game that I would recommend to most people Option of 3rd person servers that can be great for casual play or 1st person servers great for very competitive play When the new map and hitbox system is added I will try the game again,negative
Plz Fiz that screen bug ok  ,positive
Great game plain and simple My only problem is the Asian servers have too much hacking which crowds the European and American servers I would highly reccomend it to anyone as it is a great way to pass the time for only 30,positive
Never spent so much time on a game in such a short time Gets my vote,positive
Comparing slightly to Mobile version  which i have 0 problems withUntil someone is willing to change my mind about this game I will never recommend this game to a single soulPros  Game looks great gunplay is solid movement is solidCons Takes too long to get combat with out trying to die with in 2 minNot new player friendly at all  hop out find small town get geard walk out door die to someone waiting for you   repeatPeople know where you are 100  of the time but I dont This game is not a shooter it is a running simulatorI have fired my gun maybe 4 times twice to kill someone and the rest at peopel who were  invincible  the rest has been running around looking for lootenemies PS I Would rather play No Mans Sky on release day than THIS  pos,negative

PUBG is not optimized well but it worth your attention without any doubts,positive
Great game This game really knows how to make people happy Every month they release a big update with all sorts of things AND they are almost a complete game Dayz on the other hand is STILL a pre alpha This game fixes bugs so quickly and it s a really skillfull game Sound is good aiming is fantastic There are so many attachments and so many guns it s unbelievable If you are waiting to buy this game dont It s good fun with friends and defintly worth buying This game is for sure on my top 5 games list,positive
It s hunger games and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,positive
Really fun battle royale game Its H1Z1 but with even more stuff still early access so there is still some bugs but i hear that the developers are working on some gamechanging things i really recommend this game,positive
While I try not to buy early access games anymore I was peer pressured into this purchase and boy am I gladThe game is still in a questionably optmized state  FPS is consistent but slightly low some actions feel choppy etc it is definitely playable  Furthermore the gameplay that is available at the time of this review is extremely sound with a well designed map for official games  I don t have much experience in solo play but jumping into a match with 3 of your buddies can some of the most fun you can have in a video game todayFor the price tag of 30 this game already delivers a solid product even if it was released today  Honestly makes me sad The Culling is dead because the two games have so much in common,positive
never played a game with so much hype around it that is such a piece of trash FREEZES MY PC TO THE POINT WHERE I HAVE TO HARD RESET AND NO I DONT HAVE A TOASTER THIS GAME IS BROKEN AS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  SAVE YOUR MONEY,negative
Pretty awesome a must play  D,positive
I haven t played a whole lot but it s a great game The matches can get pretty intense and can be a little rage inducing as well as creating joy when you escape from a sticky situation you thouoght you would die from This is also early access and amazing for being early access,positive

I think the game is good and fun However I do not like the fact that I have to pay to unlock lootboxes that I earn through in game currencies  If it was Free to Play it would have been ok But since this is a full price game No its not ok Based on this alone Ill give it a thumbs down Greedy developers,negative
This game has a metric tonne of potential stored up It might be a little expensive for the current content but in the future once the performance has been ironed out and the content starts hitting the updates I wouldn t be surprised if this was worth more than it is now Graphics  810 but you might need a better rig to play at the higher intensity graphicsAudio  710 Detirming bullet distance and direction by the sound is super funReplayability  810 Its an online multiplayer game you have to keep playing it to get any goodFun  1010 Especially with a squad of friends the shenanigans you can achieveOverall  3340  825  Pretty damn good game,positive
Experience highly dependent on who you re playing with If this comes on sale recommended to anyone who enjoys 3rd first person hybrid games  GTA 5 or even FPS games like I do and has a bunch of friends who enjoy the same The minimum requirements posted here has got to be a joke as the game is quite poorly optimized  as of writing this review So only get it if you have a fairly powerful set up if you wish to have a constant 30 fps But since the developing studio is quite new and is pushing patches faster than a B Rush they have my attention Hopefully they keep improving on what is an emerging genre of battle royale games,positive
So many fun hours in this game and so many fun hours yet to come I recommend you play this with friendsFind a good discord server or something and find some people you can play with on a regular basis in order to get the most out of this gamePUBG is the only battleroyal game ive played and I dont see myself playing any other battleroyal game The game is a perfect balance between realisme and dankness The developers are working hard and are taking the game seriously comming out with amazing monthly patches1010 would buy again,positive
At first i didn t want to buy this game because I felt it was ripping  H1Z1  king of the kill  off but in fact it is just a better more advanced and challenging version Same concept but alot more fun,positive
Here s a simple list of Pros   Cons for PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds  PUBGPros   Extremely fun with both friends and solo  Devs update game on a regular basis bringing new weapons and fresh content  Millions of players online  The 30 is worth it  Extremely addictiveCons   Requires a somewhat decent PC build  A lot of bugs and glitches  Are fixed on a regular basis  Can sometimes be frustrating,positive
whIle the game is very fun to create a custom match you have to be a partner wich means you have to have over 50k subscibers on youtube and have to upload that game consistantally if your wondering why not bieng able to create a custom match is a big deal is because thats the only way you can pick what wepons people use pick weather or not they can go in first or third person and that is the only way to play zombies mode I think in the future they will fix this but there is no telling how long that will be I Hope they fix this soon,positive
xdddd,positive
region lock china  still fun tho,positive
Still has some work to do but as far as Early Access titles go this is easily one of the best examples of how it s done right It s not easy and you ll die a lot but on the flip side nailing a kill or coming in that top 10 is immensly satisfying Be warned though   win or lose PUBG is horribly addictive A great game that I highly recommend,positive

utter garbage game with some of the worst netcode you will see Constantly rewards players with crap pings Don t believe me   check out Battlenonsense on youtube The game takes getting killed round corners to a whole new level I constantly see 456 hit markers on players only for them to turn round and 12 shot kill me You may as well just roll a dice because even if you have a player stone cold it means nothing in this game as more often than not they will quite likely kill youYes it is Early Access but dire netcode and the creep of cheating and hackers will send this game the same way as TKOTK Players constantly sit in the blue zone pumped on energy drinkstablets it makes getting to the safe zone pointless The so called patch improvements to the game have made no difference and i would argue the game is no better than it was on launch only it now has hackers and cheats,negative

Almost 400 hours played I loved it at first but between consistent run ins with hackers and the endless list of bugs sadly I will be uninstalling until developer keeps his promise and optimizes this garbage,negative
Gun gameplay simliar to early Rust Nice degree of a  sense of loss  when you die In Rust you would lose days and days of work In COD you lose nothing In this game it is somewhere in the middle and that is good Keeps you coming back for more Duo   Squad are really fun so make sure to give them a try Devs seem responsive and are on target for full release1010,positive

I don t always give into hype but this game is FUN you need a mic or you might rage your team mate many people use discord and its better played with some one you know or met versus random que ing with a stranger won a few matches but its fun just goofing off If some one is salty they are doing it wrongEdit  Game never improved past EA Desync and laggy servers and bad controls Not woth having installed anymore,negative

I wish I could recommend this game as I believe it has great potential but the more you play the more you begin to dislike it This game has probably the worst development team you could ask for and the servers are absolutely terrible They haven t fixed the buggy and slow UI since release and they really haven t done anything to show hope for this game The game wasn t ready for release and the only reason I have over 400 hours is because of the painful grind to get bp for steam cash,negative
Great game still some solid bugs to work out like crashing upon match start or during intense firefights But totally worth it for the adrenaline itch for a few matches,positive

Easily the most over hyped game of the year It has a nice design and the zombie mode seems like endless fun  but you will never get in as a human its for content providers only  solos is some of the worst game play out there with the endless camping and the fact I can consistantly make top 10 without seeing a single person only to get shot and killed instantly from the back without firing my gun the entire 20 minutes or so it took to  running simulator  to the final circle There is a lot of potental here but there is so many no action  boring  never fire you gun  shot by a camper games that it just becomes a huge waste of time I would rather die 50th place and get 10 kills I gain nothing by making top 10 without any fights so I can never improve Honestly the amount of boring just running games will prevent me from even trying Maybe grab it if you got competant gamer friends for some fun squad action but if you dont just skip the boring farm fest,negative

Going into PUBG you re probably thinking  Oh this is that H1Z1 and Arma gametype You re rightIt s got some improvements over the old and some areas still not improved to where expected Theres three official game types and a number of custom server types I ll cover the pros and cons per section Squad CombatThis is the most played type You can que up officially as Solo Duo or Squads of 4  You will be auto paired if you quo for a team by yourself drop into a map find weapons try to survive You will compete against other players andor squads to do this and often will drop into an area with others and immediatly have to try to fight or flight your way out of it There is some meta to what to grab what attachments to prioritize etc But it comes down to a hair of luck and a hair of skill Communication with your team mates is vital using map pings and Voip  Ingame voice communication exists too In custom modes they can alter weapons to specific types or all melee or no weapons at all Allowing for some forced creativity on victoryPros High Adrenaline fun push you to the edge of your seat as you go from calm and collected to panicking each time a shot whizzes past your head Relatively stable servers while there will be some graphical glitches or lag at times I ve never exprienced a full ping drop or server crash that wasn t a private server Lots of weapons to pick from and learn what guns work for you while making due with weapons you despiiizzzeeeCons There is friendly fire which often means a team mate can just kill you for fun because you have a gun they want or you re the odd man out on a three man group Or because they wanna ruin their team s fun and run it one man They can even do it because they are just racistprejudice trolls Sometimes you will die to nothing or to complete lag You can duck past a corner and be in the clear but because on the other s screen you re still in view Well pop goes the weasel Custom servers are usually terrible to join Mostly because its 80  randoms against a team who work together with voip and set up the map s rules so they know EXACTLY what will be in play just not whereZombiesRecently added and only avaliable as a custom mode A team of humans must survive against a near hundred zombies Zombies get no means of protecting themself but are legion They can break doors but pickup no items Players still follow the standard rules Compared to normal this is a different approach but without good co ordination becomes a cat and mouse game where the zombies get scattered and have no idea where humans are until they get picked offSadly I can not procon this as currently it is just a heavilly flawed gametype As it s a custom mode usually the humans will all be the creator and his friends If you EVER get to be the human consider yourself blessed Following that you re going to experience the same as normal modes but with a massive handicap Zombie teams teamkill CONSTANTLY They don t seem to care they will teamkill each other then other zombie teams until the humans get a free win Threats of being banned off the custom server fall empty since they will either not be banned or just find a new server to troll on In it s current state I suggest ignoreOverall the game is high tension fun and despite my gripes I heavilly enjoy it Even when I get TK d and have to watch my team and grin when they get whats coming to themSuggestions for the devs Remove Team Damage Theres far too many teamkillers and currently it serves no real purpose to be able to kill your own team There is no reprocutions for it pre made teams are using it to farm items and weapons off of a single pug who they will drop in a heartbeat Zombie mode is incredibly flawed because of the TK happy zombies In most situations a player won t intent to hurt their team mate and accidentally shooting them is rare But its become incredibly frustrating to que up get in game then drop just to get to play for five minutes before your own team mate shotgun blasts you in the head because you picked up the Vector or because they think you re going to weight them down later Fix Zombies Right now it is virtually UNPLAYABLE for anyone but the humans Zombies have no way to universally communicate with each other they kill each other all the time  see above and end up running around aimlessly Atleast restrict the map faster or add some kind of indication for all zombies to see whenever a human player is spotted by a zombie OR Increase zombie melee damage because right now its pointless to try to gank a human as one squad Optional  Punish teamkillers Accidental purpose doesn t matter If there is a punishment its currently not working Lock them out of games for awhile after a teamkilling make them unable to use two primaries something Right now no one cares no one has insentive to stop I m fine with accidentally being sniped or being shot over good reason by a teammember But when its not even the first five minutes and I get gunned down from behind and when I ask why their logic being and I quote  Thanks for the sniper LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   then being gunned to death mode Yeah thats going to kill you in longivity quicklyOverall Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is a fun game in early development still that I do recommend you buy The Dev team do listen to the complaints and criticism and even add things based on popular demand but you will be facing a lot of headaches going forward You will not win often but when you do it will be the sweetest victoryAlso  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  boats Just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  m,positive

Slow devsGot their pockets full does not fix servers and bugs,negative
Not particularly well optimised yet Graphics are fairly poor UI is poorly designedI was expecting games to last longer more time between zones shrinking and less time sprinting around like this is GTAGameplay is just too fast was expecting this to be more of a survival game In short if I wanted to play CS GO i d have bought CS GO,negative
Ayyyyyy is a good Vidyagam with the buds,positive
will give it a 710the things it can do better on are  It should show a rewind of how we got killed When people are about to get rammed by a car they jump and then they re safe very frustrating The inventory should not take the whole screen you get shot while lookin in the inventoryBut in the end this is a very fun and enjoyable gamewaitin for it to come out of the early acccess stage,positive
Such good wow,positive
Its A Great Game But There Is A Annoying Bug That Doesnt Put Textures On Building s Which Is Quite Annoying It Even Has Frequent Crashers And Sometimes The Game Freezes In Loading Screen But When You Are In The Game It Is AWESOME I Love The Cars Steering Gun Physics And It  s Basic Combat It Also Is Very Fun With Friends I Play With One Mate And It Is G8 The Thrill Of Winning A Game Is Breathtaking And Can Be A Accomplishment If You Have Never Won BeforeSometimes When I Win I Break My Windows From Screaming XD It Is Good To Camp Every Once In A While But Can Be Sucky When The Circle Leaves You For Dead And You Have To Run In The Open The Way You Get  Rare Guns  Is  From Packages And You Will Hear A Airoplane And Will See Red Smoke If You Are Clsoe To It SO WATCH OUT It Is Probs Best Game And Keep It Up PUBGI Even Nomminated It For  The Even Better Than I Expected Award,positive
Really fun in squads and late game is addictively good to get that adrenaline,positive

I play my third match I get good equipment from the startThe game is in my favor I acquire a buggy I get a supply drop I snipe and I kill I make it to the last 10 I snipe 5 enemies I find 3 and beat them to death with my bare hands I chase the last guy and blow his brains out As my reward for murdering several natives on an island I get a free copy of PUBG The game is just like real life,positive

Good game i recommend it 100 ,positive
This game is the worst awful cancerous and amazing game that I will play forever and ever because self hate and abuse is my jam I love this game and the way it makes me die a little inside every time I land out of the plane Buy the gameIt s easily worth the Quit being a puy1010 Worth every penny,positive
Great game so far I play on a partitioned Mac and the slight lag is probably due to my hardware The matches are really hectic and fun to play,positive
So much fun you forget it s early access Come and kill your friends As of this posting the Dev team updates at least once a month There s still a few miles to go but unlike other games in early access i have full faith that this will make it to full release,positive
Has a lot of glitches but still a top tier game Should get for playing with friends Lul,positive
I ve encountered this game just like 999  of it s player base did by watching Twitch streams and youtube videosBeing something relatively new in the multiplayer scene  THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER BASE I managed to talk few of my friends into playing itI m not going to lie we ve spent hundreds of hours on itThat was until the official release of 10Keep in mind that we re talking about previously most played game in the world at some point a game which brought it s developers millions  if not 10 digit numbers and as any sane person you d expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes right LOL wrong We re talking about Bluehole hereYou really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in They had everything massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT  NOTE  FREE   NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators insane ACTIVE player base a product that s close to being 10 ready EverythingThey got money they got everything And what do they do   In game purchasesIt s disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from playersThey rushed the 10 to be able to implement in game purchases and instead of actually WORKING on it what do they do  More platformsNot only that none of the platforms performed remotely well they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in game purchasesSince I could go about this all day long and considering I m actually rating a game here and not it s thirsty developer I ll focus on it now Pros   Fast queue times due to high player base  SOLID graphics  Good ballistics  Sniper and AR bullet dropCons   Fully released game with performance of an early alpha game  HACKERS HACKERS EVERYWHERE My God I ve played so many games but I ve never encountered a game with so many hackers in it Nearly every game contains at least 2 3 hackers which at this point don t even try hiding it Bluehole is doing nothing to fix this issue despite saying they are Over the time I ve seen NO improvements in this domain  Countless game breaking bugs  getting killed by nothing when vaulting getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed reloading sometimes doesn t reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed  HORRIBLE performance issues  High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium high settings at all times  Hilarous netcode So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn t even have a line of sight constant stuttering 60  fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect  Horrible bullet detection system  this one mostly affects Shotguns  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  level design This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size but ironically has least content least quality looting area a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map  mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone Even though the original map is better they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone  Performance bugs and glitches Here I don t aim for graphics and design glitches I am talking about glitches which straight up make you lose games For instance since the latest patch I can no longer run for more than 3 seconds without my character stopping for no obvious reason  And no this isn t caused by my internet connection or my PC it s a common issue nowadays   I will stop with Cons for now since there s only so much time I can waste on this review But yes there are way moreBottom line if you haven t already bought this game  DO NOT Save your money There are better alternatives if you re just taking up a new game and they re even free to play They don t have some of the mechanics PUBG has and that s a shame but at least they re optimized Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game let alone play it properlyMESSAGE TO THE DEVELOPERS If by any chance SOME of the brainiacs with influence in development actually take time and look through reviews for constructive criticism  Stop bullying Epic Games just because they did a better game than you did How can you be such sore losers if your business logic is to sue someone just for delivering a better product Instead of suing them focus on your own game You wouldn t lose any players if you just fixed your god damn game I tried playing Fortnite and I disliked it but I am going to quit PUBG if things don t change as I m no longer able to enjoy the game It s common sense that just one guy ranting here wont mean a thing to you but I m just one of the many who share this opinion If anything WE should be the ones getting compensated from YOU for failing to deliver a proper product which we paid for Just imagine buying a Ferrari  Which you probably did with the money which obviously wasn t poured into additional development and you re presented with a Ferrari which runs on a Prius engine You d obviously be mad as hell and demand your money backThis is not a dead game yet there s still time to fix it but not the way you re running things,negative
If you like the typical but good battle royale genre games then thsi is the game for you It has it s moments of boringness sometimes but at the same time every game is random You don t know how it would play out I recommend this game if you really REALLY want a battle royale game Keep in mind the optimization is kinda meh but I heard recently they plan to optimize it much more It can also earn you a few dollars because you could sell the crates and it s loot at the Steam market place Overall I rate this game 610,positive

You want a honest review of this game  Read this I have played PUBG since it first came out in 2017 The game was different than others and very addicting I have watched the game get worse and worse over time  like 99  of multiplayer games do with age With over 400 hours of play time and a strong knowledge of the game you can trust what I have to say Pros  The best battle royal game to date If you are a Fornite player this game is more realistic and all around better game for me aiming down sights  ADS is more than enough to make that decision  Unique game Looting is fun well except when you have another player chasing you through houses blasting rounds at you when you first land and all you can find is a frying pan and getting kills is addicting as well ah the feeling of knowing you are making someone who just spent 10minutes of their life looting up and they lose it all and have to start over because YOU shot them Muhaha This game gives you adrenaline like no other when you hear shots being shot from behind you you hear a car pull up to the house you are camping in Or when you get a kill  Every match is different from the last one Not at all like Call of Duty You get a different experence every match tons of choices of where to land and where to go different loot and the circle doesn t land in the same spot CONS  Unless you are playing solo where the mistakes are your own fault 4 out of 5 matches I will get paired up with sucidial idiots in my squad that want to land in the most hot areas and expect to make it out aliveresulting in sudden death 80  of the time or losing a team member or two and having to finish the match going 2v4 against other squads Resulting in a waste of time When you get paired up with players who have sense the game usually goes well  Feel of the game Graphics are good and it don t run too bad for being such a big game But shooting feels a little yuck You have to zero in when sniping and shoot in front of running targets farther away etc which is realistic and neat But recent patch adding more recoil to rifles really makes me want to drop what use to make my heart skip when I found it M4A4 for a ump  AR   Smg Lots of times your shot will be DEAD ON and you wont hit jack Like you just fired a magazine of blanks The shooting is no where near as smooth as most FPS like CoD or Rainbow Six Siege To sum all of this up The game is fun but it can feel like a huge waste of time There is always going to be the fat virgins living in mommy s basement futher muckers that kills you before you have a chance to see him like all multiplayer games Just keep in mind this game is full of them with no ranking system I used to get mad if I didn t make it to the last 10 alive now I get excitied over getting just one kill Like I said this game IS better than Fortnite,negative
its aight,positive
I reccomend this game to people who have high end builds because the 20 fps on the average build is unplayable I understand it s early access but the optimization and updates has lead me to have above 60 fps but then the next update it drops to 20 Overall the game is fun but unplayable at times,negative

Very fun game I like the style of it I think the only thing they should consider is adding in a red dot of when someone is shooting you most of the time I don t know where I m getting shot from If they could add this without making it overpowered I think it would make the game better imo,positive

Got pan GG  i only playi as a team but its a good game cant wait for the vaulting over walls   mechanics still alittle sucky but still early access  still in need of a polish,positive
Fix the bugs and crashes and I would recommend this game At the moment it is unplayable because you never know when you re going to crash no matter how beefy your system is Very frustrating,negative
This is a great game that is on track to becoming polished for the FPS communityIt is pretty simple either you are going to hide and chase tail the whole time trying to survvive or you are going to load up with a couple enemies a few hourses away and prepare for hunting seasonThe updatespatches really do improve gameplay every time I am really hoping they  improve the Pioneer Crates and what is available out of them without turning this into some p2w game People that complain about the game either should be playing something much more simple like Solitaire or have as much a  stable connection rig  as  Trump s mouth,positive
Lots of fun always different and a challenge can t wait for more maps and features,positive
Just done a friends culling Looking for players that are not afriad to chat on discord if we play games together and also up for a laugh Top 3 games i play right now are PUBG rocket league and overwatch feel free to add me and dont be shy in talking either in Pm Profile or on discord Welcome everyone ,positive
I hate this game more than i hate milk in tea,negative
The game is full of bugs Bullets dont register In general it is a very nice idea but Bluehole sucks as a company and just dumped another game I recommend fortnite The game is cartooney but it is perfectly written Currently im getting game crashes for no reason My Specs   i7 7800 1050ti 16gbram Drivers updated If game was free I would recommend it but paying 30 euro for it is a waste,negative
well the game needs tutorial or some kind of offline mod because f you re new about last man standing games  like me the game only let you to play with other online players that nearly played 2000 hours,negative

This is the most fun I ve had in a game in a very long time everything I do is so satisfying it feels so fresh and new I just want to keep getting better and better at this game So much fun can t put it down 1010 yes buy it you won t regret it,positive
This game could be great but i just dont see that happening If you like shooting someone 8 10 time for them just to jump spin in the air and shoot you 2 times and you die than this is the game for you The biggest problem of this game is the broken hit registration Its sooooo bad its criminal Just type in on youtube and you can see how bad it is They still havent even attempted to fix it so that leads me to believe it will never be fixed like rainbow six siege Another broken game with potential because it does have its fun moments but just to broken If they do fix it than hell yes i would recommend it but in its current state not even worth the money Should be 10 dollars Save your 30 dollars for a game that actually works,negative
Dont waste your time on that gimmicky game called H1Z1 H1 feels like it was made for kids in mind with all the crap you can get This game is the opposite The focus is more on the actual encounters  engagments  mechanics  and overall player experince Note this game is also far more relalistic I would 100  reccomend to anyone and everybody Best times to have either by yourself or 1 to 3 friends Your heat will be racing if you are in the top 10 i promise,positive
911 do recommended,positive

Last time I had this much fun with an early access title was with Kerbal Space Program and if you can pull off  that  level of fun factor this early in development then consider me bamboozled and onboard,positive
I like this very much but put simply I advise cautionThis is a very rough around the edges game and I feel that by purchasing you take a gamble on the devs sticking with the project  which I hope for or running with the moneyThe game regardless is quite fun alone and with friends One thing I haven t seen in many reviews is the ability to jump into duo or squad  alone with random and I ve had a very fun time Thank you for your time reading and I hope this helps with your purchase,positive
i would say this game by far has been the most enjoyable for me i dont normally enjoy survival games or games that put you against other players like free for alls etc but this game is enjoyable for what its worth you get either 3 choices before going into a match  solo duo or squad  i love going into a match with 3 friends and just trying to survive for as long as possbile the cons in this game though theres only one map and it does get boring after so long thats why a lot of people take breaks from this game and play a different game but for now the only cons i can say this game has is theres only one map and few new guns would be fun to bring into the mix maybe camos for guns etc i dont know but yes if your looking to spend 30 dollars on a slow paced survival game i think this is the best choice rate this game would give it a 7 8 out of 10  3,positive

Awesome game For me   GLITCHES  are way less than I thought they would be Negative comments made me nervous Also  HACKERS   are also less as the negative comments said I was not buying game due to comments about hackersIt is  SLOW PACED  then H1Z1 and Fortnite that is the reason I prefer it Also customization is awesome  GUNS   WARDROBES   I also love CSGO over COD because of slow pacing btwOverall amazing game hope they keep it alive for longer time and this game dont die They need to make it more competative,positive

I dont usually give reviews for games as i m often satisfied with the games i choose to play but i have to make an exception for this game first this isnt a bad game not as bad as people make it to be the bugs arent that bad and i havent encountered any obvious cheater however i can only recommend this game to 2 very specific kind of gamers this game would be worth it if u have a pro friend  or friends to play with or if u r alone and u would to spend hundred of hours on it the first 20 30 hours would be dedicated to practicing i have spent 20 hours in this game and the amount of frustration that it gave me far exceeds the amount of joy now i have to admit that i REALLY suck at the game as i dont have much experience with shooters but its not just the shooters aspect that got me down the learning curve here is almost as steep as dota 2 during these twenty hours i have killed no more than 20 people which comes back to 2 3 games per kill i ve seen a forum where a guy did some statistics on the matchmaking system and the results were less than fair Bluehole focuses on shorter queue time over fair matching i dont blame them on this aspect because i understand that its not easy to match 100 people together but it does make it extremely hard for newcomers i ve watched dozens of videos on pubg on youtube teaching how to be better but in short it really only comes with the amount of hours you put into the game the majority of times i get killed by campers people with better weapons people who just happened to get me from behind 3 seconds after i checked my surroundings or just straight up losing a gunfight cuz he s a better shooter in solo games i usually just spend most of my time  around 20min getting loots just to be killed by someone cuz i let me guard down for 5 seconds i ve seen people saying that i should drop into hot zones just to practice but 9 times out of 10 someone comes to kill me with a better weapon if i cant find a weapon he kills me with a pistol if i get a pistal he kills me with a shotgun if i have a shotgun he kills me in a distance with AKM and if u cant find a x4 or x8 scope u would be severely disadvantaged in the late game if i dont die in the early game i die late game by someone with a x4 or x8 scope i understand that it s all about  git gud  but it will takes dozens of hours before that happens and i just dont find it fun to be killed over and over for 20 30 hours  maybe even longer squad  4 players team isnt much better usually when i play squad 1 2 people in the team don have a mic and 1 2 people will die right after landing if u are patient enough and are willing to spend dozens of hours going through the  git gud s frustration u WILL enjoy this game once u finally get there it s a fun game but extremely unfriendly towards newcomersi just cant put up with it anymore and this is coming from someone who has beaten  dark souls  and  ninja gaiden  on  master ninja mode  just to give an example  the frustration from fighting  the nameless king  in dark souls 3 or the  test of valor  on master ninja mode in  ninja gaiden 2  was NOTHING compare to what i experienced here,negative
Good graphics but its kinda boring when u cant find anyone and match takes half a hour Sometimes when i start to play it crashes randomly idk why BUT really good game,positive
Actually un playable PC more than meets requirements  i7 16gbram gtx1050 and with all the bugs in this game not too mention the constant lag spikes almost every 10 15 seconds there s literally no reason to play this game unless you have a 2kPC at least with gig internet,negative

Nothing to say Ridiculous bugs poor performance and those mighty 17 tick servers with all the rubberbanding,negative
Great game but the devs put 0 thought into some things For example you can land on some of the islands in the game and not a single boat is spawned leaving you to die to the circle every time it happens Ive tested it multiple times and the islands on this game are a death sentence as the devs dont seem to realise that not having vehicles available in this kind of situation ruins the gaming experience Not to mention really bad movement and other bugs that really need a fix,positive
WORLDS BEST GAME,positive
Great game most terrible sync in the history of gaming It s pathetic for a game that is out of EA to have a sync such as this game has You spray someone with blood splattering like there s no tommorow he kills you you watch the deathcam he barely has a scratch510 help me out of this miserable game I m tired of getting my jimbos bamboozled,negative

The game has a lot of great potential and is a lot of fun to play However the company seems to have gotten into a cash grab rather then finish the actual game My back up point to this is the lack of many key features the community would like to see in the game as well as fixing the tri seater bike certain terrian and map bugs etc Even with these key core things to fix they are pumping out PUBG Mobile a mobile game before fixing some of the issues with the main game  Another frustration is the crate system Before you would spend BP earned in games to buy crates to customize your character Then they added into the game special crates that required a 250 key to open You can buy these crates right out or buy one of the regular crates where you have a 40  chance to get one of the key locked crates Why    You can sell the locked crates for about 30 cents So they have locked or slowed down one of the key components of the game behind a pay wall   This new trend which is becoming more and more populare with gaming companies to break up a game and make players pay for for certain pieces of the game is cancer to gaming Any company that would stoop to that low of a level becomes a lower level company,negative
the battleground is like a devil s den The game addicts people and ultimately lead them to their doom                                        1              This game literally ruined my friend s life Once he came to me and asked to play this new game that he found I at first thought that the game is super hard That exact friend is now on a highway to end of his life His main goal now has become becoming the best player in the game Therefore as his friend I too shall join the meaningless journey and ditch my life I invoke upon you O battleground take my soul and transform me into the best player,positive

I like this game quite a bit I play it almost every day mostly with friends The only suggestion I would make is that they make it so you can get keys in the crates I don t want to buy keys and I don t feel like I should have to buy keys just to open crates I play for fun and I understand buying keys helps yall make money but there should still be a way to get keys without having to pay for them Great game would recommend,positive

I like this game but the company cares more about adding loot crates to get people spending more money  after they already paid for the game than actually fixing things I have a very good PC setup and can run this game at 144 FPS capped with a mix of Ultra and Low settings but it crashes quite often since the last patch there are issues with ping when Asian players are in the NA servers and it has a ton of glitches that they fail to fix such as how buggy the parachutes are Also since the last patch I have once teleported from one side of the map to another It was on the map Myanmar and I teleported from close to Impala all the way to Prison after I landed Overall I d give this game a 6510 potential to be a really good game and I still enjoy it but they need to clean up their act and fix the issues the community is talking about,positive
This game really has a lot of potentialBUT1They don t optimize patches well so we had a 54GB patch that they just added some breakable fences2 A lot of hackers and I mean a LOT3Many many many bugs4Players get an advantage over the latencyMy opinion   I suggest you buy the game with friendsIf not leave it for later,positive

After a long hours of playing this game I can say that I would not recommend this unless you re here for memesIf not save the money buy drug insteadDevelopers didn t care about the players and adding more and more ridiculous cratesThey promised no cosmetic What is this Are you guys trying to imitate EA  What are you going to release next  DLC for PUBG Full released game  I can see this game probably going to be F2P just like H1Z1 This game is full of bugs and hackers I am thankful for devs for fixing this but sometimes fixing it making it more brokenRegion lock They say  there is no reason to region lock    2017Why Now  When most streamers moved to Fortnite or other games they are trying to clickbait the players again with this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t They promised us custom server but where is it  Only available for YoutuberTwitch streamer with 50000 subs  150 concurrent views But how did some people with no name or whatsoever can have their own custom server  Take a look at the Custom Match list They re not even streamer and mostly unknown people who hosted the server how did they get the server  Some hacker clans  if you play long enough you know the hacker clans have their own custom server    PUBG Support is really uselessI contacted PUBG Support and reported players hacking with A CLEAR VIDEO OF EVIDENCE  snake hackinstant healaimbotetc etc The next day I play it s the same players AGAINContacted them and guess what  WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THIS PLAYERWAITING FOR A NUMBER OF REPORTS TO waiting for numbers of reports  What a waste of time trying to talk to themThe game used to be good Very good I really orused to love the gameI m very dissapointed of what it has becomeUntil they enforce a strong anti hackVAC ban or whatsoever measure to fight the hackers and fix the game I might change the reviewFor now RIP PUBGPS Still playing with friends for MEMES,negative

while in many ways this is the greatest game i have ever played blueholes inability to control the hacking ruins it The rush that this game gives you is second to none and the antics  of squad combat can be quite memorable but every third game im killed by someone named qqqq123123chag who is tracking me through walls and spraying in my area for 3 consecutive headshots i can hear PUBGs death rattle,negative
I loved PUBG but recently the amount of player who are hacking the game is unbearable Over half the time I m getting killed by players who are obviously using hacks  auto aim picking up items that aren t actaully there unlimited ammo etc There are several easy ways to address the cheating issue but it seems like relatively little has been doneI can t recommend this game until the cheating issue has been addressed,negative
It was one of my favorite games but the blatant cheating is so absurd Its clear that bluehole s priority is not the playerbase or preventing cheating because months and months have gone by wiht multiple updates yet theres still aimbot hacks in 45 games at least Its so stupid And there are so many ways to combat cheaters or filter them from the honest playerbase yet they just crank out the same game on different platforms develop new maps and release garbage loot crates that you have to pay money to open Save yourself the heartbreak and dont buy,negative

PUBG precisely the market leader for games rnReview  Firstly i d like to say that the game is not as much fun without friends you can indeed do a Fill search where u get matched up with random people and have a good chance of making a few friends but overall playing Duos and Squads and Events is a lot more fun than Solo although solo isnt badI find the Cons of solo to be  Quite a lot of running could get slightly boring alone Too many campers hiding relentlessly Quite a long game and you could die almost instantly though rewarding to win can be frustating sometimes Minor things not too much                               Secondly on the gameplay s part the game is hyper realistic There is bullet drop realistic car in respect that cars can blow up easily and it isnt impossible to shoot through car windows also the cars have fuel As for Ammo there are various types and the inventory arrangement is something you rather learn overtime the way i learned how to play in basics was by watching guides for beginners helped out a LOT The weapon attachments are quite differing to range and that makes you the decision maker for how you want to play your style There are a number of ways you can play according to your style whether be sniper ambush camper Though Undesirable by other players can prove useful sometimes Con  Leads to a slow and boring game from your perspective assaulter rusher  The kind who generally dies easily unless played very carefullyOne thing I d like to remind you when you re gonna buy the game is that theres TPP and FPP Third person and First person now if youre playing first person its a hard chance that youll get jumped on out of nowhere as in third person you can look without actually peeking your character in enemy sightStrafing Useful to dodge sometimes peeking corners overall it doesnt have too much usage but when in corner Tree to Tree fights or from cover it is very usefulThat pretty much wraps it up if you have enjoyed games like Rainbow Six Seige Battlefield Counter Strike this could be your new jam  Overall Review  9510PS  Dont worry about servers lag isnt a big problem Yes can get small spikes here and there when picking up items but generally not a problem,positive

I already hated bluehole as they re LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  devs and Playerunknown himself is more than a bit of a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  They just released an apology saying what they ve done wrong and they ll try to fix it but it probably won t be happening They also just decided to sue the guys behind fortnite Epic Games developers who update frequently and make new and meaningful additions to their games I don t even like Fortnite it s not my style of a game Bluehole has been pretty open about their dislike of fortnite because of it s similarities and Bluehole can t seem to grasp that they can t have the sandbox to themselves  Kind of ironic since pubg started off as a free mod like DayZThe game is fun with friends but a lot of things can be fun with friends Stuff is still wonky shooting is entirely random and physics bugs are still around and rampant with vehicles It is a fun multiplayer experience and I prefer the gameplay over fortnite s but Bluehole is terribleIt really is a shame that Bluehole and to a lesser extent Brendan Greene had to be the ones in control of pubg Under most other devs this game would be amazing,negative
PERF  r5 1600 Gtx 1060 3gb game isn t best runner but I still get 80 140fps average so no reason to cry about perfomance unless you have a really bad PC in my opinionHackers  Out of 300 hours of playing this game I have seen maybe 6 hackers compared to CS GO this is nothing Just because someone is better then you at this game doesn t make them a hackerCrates Money Grab   Yes they are putting a lot of dumb crates on this game but get the crate sell it make   Just because you can spend money on crates doesn t mean you need too All these are reasons for bad reviews but I don t have any issues with this game It is fun to play with friends and is really enjoyable to play,positive

Great game concept Fun to play alone or with friends The only problem with the game is the devs can t stop the over whelming number of hacks Constantly being killed by people who arent even close with their aim but still getting head shots or modifying the engine notepad so there isnt any grass so they can see you Ive play free games with better anti cheat software than this game Then when they try to implement anti cheart software there are too many issues with it    Maybe because there are so any cheaters out there you can t get a descent game going Pay the 30 when they get it right,negative
This game has some of the most satisfying ways to kill people Unfortunately everyone and their moms hack on this game I know PC games that that is a common scenario but this game is the worst with it excluding CS GO Its lag is unbearable and honestly its not really any fun anymore This is exactly why everyone is jumping off this bandwagon I m on my way out too now If you plan to play seriously then this game will infuriate you unless you choose to purchase some of the hacks online If you don t care about that stuff then you may still enjoy this game I might take some games too seriously and thats my issue but I can t even enjoy this game anymore Maybe everyone is not hacking but I can spend a whole 2 clips shooting at people that should be ez pz kills and then i just get slaughtered I ve been playing shooters on PC since Counter Strike 15 and I doubt I m that garbage at shooters but i digress I can t enjoy a game that just isn t fair to play anymore RIP PUBG,negative
I ve been playing this game now for maybe 8 months and I find it never endingly amazing  It s the open world format combined with the challenges of fighting real time real players  some who seem ungodly good and the strategic layout of the landscapes and buildings that populate the mapsWhile it is a challenge most of the time  getting pinched between two teams for example can lead to someone rage quitting  it still has a charm that I only remember from the original CS,positive

No excuse I purchased this game for me and a friend at 45 a copy on Steam in early access  oof We played a couple hours but being competitive CSGO players we quit due to the nature of third person PvP A few weeks ago I hopped into Shroud s stream and the game seemed to be in a good state Yeah he s running it on a beast of a machine but surely it runs well on recent hardware now right  Yeah he has thousands of hours in the game but surely it has a foundation solid enough for decent FPS players to start off with some momentum reasoning that applies to any skill one practices right Don t kid yourselfThis game is more than just broken  It s a scam Evidently  PUBG Corp  is overcome with greed costing the gaming industry a BR title with immense potential Let s go over what holds this game back from being somewhat decentAfter starting up the game you re greeted with a dank loading screen after which the dice are rolled and you ll either be greeted with a lobby screen or a message telling you that the servers can t handle the playerbase the game has somehow amassed If you ve been met with the latter go take a nap or play a different game It s gonna be a while If you ve been met with the former hop into a match Take a moment in pre game to strafe around and track some noggins because that s all the non combat non hostile AO aim practice you re gonna get That means in order to practice the weapon handling in this game you will need to go through pre game dropping looting  never what you want to practice with mind you and either running off to shoot at a wall until you attract people to kill you or finding an aim battle  ex  a school hallway 1v1 both with similar loot Once you get into your aim battle you are subject to many different factors that will affect the outcome of the fight It could be something as simple as someone taking you out from behind or your enemy surviving a slew of accurate shots because it s the early game and the server is awful and the list goes onYou decide to go for a hot drop  School it is As you drop you think things are going fine but as the parachutes deploy the game stutters your parachute freezes you and you can t cut the cord You re trying to find a way down while you see people running all over looking for the loot that has yet to spawn Your feet hit the ground after too long and you re running  see  lurching You soon realize the movement feels like you re coming up on a sedative while ice skating with your ankles tied together You realize speed is gained like a loaded semi truck on a steep incline but you can casually crawl through window panes Overall the movement feels entirely alien and this is only somewhat remedied by being fully boosted With that out of the way it s time to loot You press F to pick up that first aid kit and your hand reaches at it pulls back and you continue on your way You find an M16 with some ammo but the server is still recovering from the idea of being used You re right clicking away on the ammo and it s just not working for you but hey you re aiming down your sights straight at the ground now After this is completed you take your weapon and go searching for blood Someone starts shooting you from behind and you find yourself some cover Knowing because you hear them that they think you re trying to heal back up and are approaching you you lean back around the corner and take them down in a few shots Hearing people around you now aware of your position you press your heal item bind to find the FAK wasn t picked up despite doing what the game told you in order to acquire it Your most recent kill has the FAK on him luckily but the storm draws near There s a jeep right next to the road so you run over and hop in Get on the gas pedal and you re moving quickly enough You re in the circle now and you navigate to safety so you can heal Little did you know that minor incline was actually an IED and the heaviest part of your vehicle is now floating in the air It topples over slides and is impacted by what is surely a comet coming straight toward it at maximum velocity Nope It s a small mud wall This nearly kills you but there is still hope You dismount and quickly find yourself a building to hole up in so as to heal The heal item bind is hit the timer is almost finished when you find yourself headshot by  name a 762 chambered DMR or SR  The death cam shows this guy has been sitting on a hill his whole life watching you through his 8x scope waiting for the moment he can catch you not moving Alternatives include  but aren t limited to  A guy chucking a grenade at you  From where   someone spamming the cabin of your vehicle causing it to explode or the too common cheater I ve written that section as such to maybe help people understand some of what you ll have to put up with in just a few minutes during a match Some things change It could be a pan you found and you could die right off the bat You could ve heard that guy behind you and killed him before he damaged you That FAK could ve actually gone into your inventory and you could have gotten more kills You could ve had a bike and flipped it to your death much earlier Again the list goes on This game is almost entirely random and that s not helped by the lack of anything more than a paper mache foundation To put it simply the game feels floaty There is no gravity That which goes up won t come down for a good minute  including your weapon s barrel after firing CQB  despite how much there is in this game not to be confused with MOUT requires intensity and momentum which simply cannot be had given the movement of the game US SOF operators aren t sticking random adrenaline syringes into their arm before they stack up on a door I reference reality because the most common defense for the movement in this game is realism If you ve ever moved in your life you should know better than to pull that card Often Arma is used in comparison but that s a good game  Arma is a military simulator that before you even start modding still manages to have tighter movement than PUBG Replace Arma with Escape from Tarkov and we re comparing the worst modern combat movement to the best I ve ever felt Credit is due  I like the leaning system and have made great use of itThe gunplay in this game is okay at best if you like a complete lack of energy in yours The M416 kills for you The SCAR L makes killing easy The M16 is better than nothing The AKM has its moods but it works well overall The UMP seems OP to me The Uzi is fun early on Shotguns are inconsistent Sometimes you ll one shot someone wearing level 3 armor sometimes your shot won t register Pistols are hilarious I ve one tapped people around corners with the 1911 and I ve spammed entire mags into people to no effect I despise how my weapon is pointed at the ceiling when attempting to ADS near a wallwindowspeck of dust Your weapon should point toward the ground unless popping a corner or a friendly crosses your LOF When you ADS with your weapon stuffed into a surface your character should take a step back or raiselower their weapon around the corner  if leaning around it during the ADS to assume a firing position This is basic stuff guysStop adding content to the game Stop feeding off the bottom of the barrel Get back to formula and build a proper foundation for this concept  At this point I regret having spent money on this game Don t even play it for freeGLHF,negative
Just an abysmall experience from start to finish You spend 15 minutes getting gear and then get sniped to death from a mile away by a guy who is hiding or if you want to make it to end game and win you just get gear for the first five minutes and then hide until the final 5 or players are left and then try and pick them off It s just a dumb game and a terrible gaming concept,negative

The absolut LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing worst game ive ever played in my life The game is riddled with bugs cheaters lag and stupid nonsensical updates that bring nothing useful to the table The sad thing is the game is actually entertaining and great to play with friends but is not worth the money or effort,negative
Game was short lived as I predicted because of the lack of actual skill by the development team Money went elsewhere and they never thought to hire proper professionals,negative

I did enjoy this game and spent so much time on it but hacking has made this game unplayable Actually cheating is out of control and you see all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Bluehole did to it If Bluehole cannot delopy effective anti cheat updates I would definitely not recommend them to play it,negative
I really  loved this game Yeah  there are still so much things to fix but they are fixing bugs and other things step by step That game must be the top game of the 2018,positive
A very good and active battle royale shooter but its high price of 30 dollars means it needs to bring much more to the table to compete with its best competitor Fortnite I would give it a 610 because Fortnite has more gameplay functionality and gives an infinitely better value than PUBG,positive
Sometimes it s fun and sometimes it s a head scratcher Still needs some work,positive
honestly cannot praise this game enough in my opinion is the best battle royale out there the graphics the flow of the game even how the guns and firefight systems work are brilliant my only issue is the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trend every game seems to be falling into microtransactions and loot boxes pubg heavily suffers from this it doesnt affect gameplay but if you want to look good you bet your LOVE LOVE LOVE  your gunna have to spend a good 10 quid on a coat or in my case the twitch prime balaclava other then that one fairly large issue i believe pubg could be a masterpeice if the devs put more time into making it into what the players want and not some loot box cash grab peice of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 8510 much potential,positive
the game can be fun at times but after playing fornite smoother experience and coming back to this its like night and day honestly i wouldnt reccomend this game until bluehole fixes the gameplay side of the game like optimization and rubber banding also there is a bunch of chiness hacker that just ruin the experience,negative

I grit my teeth every time I boot up this game just to play with my friends who seem to like the game for whatever reason I have endured this heavily flawed game just for them but seeing that PUBG is taking yet another competitor Epic Games s Fortnite to court I am relieved to say that I will never EVER touch this game ever againNow it may seem that my main reason for this boycott is because of PUBG s questionable ethics and you re right it is However this is only one of my reasons If I were to be blunt as I have already mentioned this game is HEAVILY flawed and the game is simply not fun And to quote Reggie Fils Aim the current president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America  If it s not fun why bother  I believe PUBG s developers are well aware of this fact which is why they put so much effort in removing their competition  simply patheticTL DR  Game performs inconsistently  constant FPS drops  lag  Hackers TONS OF THEM Would not recommend this game to ANYONE If possible I would have had paid someone to buytake this game away from my library,negative

Spent a lot of time playing this game unfortunately my crew quit because of the chinese hackers I stuck with the game I thought with steady improvements this game could be the best Update after update they improved implementing death cams and reporting to stop hackersNow when I go to log in I get kicked by Battle Eye for using non allowed program  VmWare I use this program every day and it boots with my computer now I have to close every process associated with it before I launch the game That is the last straw for me now I cant use the programs I want to use on my computer just to play this game Get your stuff together PUBG Corp,negative

Great concept fun to play with friends however more than a year passed since release and still same junky bugs stutters faulty textures and a lot more What the hell is  Restart Lobby  mean anyway Can t drive a car properly due to sudden flip overs and jumps over the sky Sucky drop rates make the game utterly boring They should really pay some attention spend money and hire developers to fix all these flaws,negative
Its better than fort nite so thats all you need to know,positive
Trash and not worth 30 bucks,negative
Game could be better in some ways Vaulting seems to take too long when going over short objects I hate that windows and balconies get in the way of shooting unsuspecting enemies below when you can see them  you attempt to shoot but then realize the window sill or bar or balcony is in the way of your weapon and you just expose your position to the enemy I hate how loud your footsteps are when you move just an inch I also dislike when you run barefoot but sometimes when you re indoors you footsteps sound like you re wearing shoes makes no sense this game has a long way to go but is worth the 30 bucks,positive
This game is lit xD,positive
Not a whole ton of bugs but the ones that are present are too much Opening your inventory will freeze your game getting you killed structures won t load in and best of all the black screen when you start a match I know it s not my pc becuase it used to not happen to me before It s just an annoying game,negative

Well it was fun while it lasted I got a buddy to start playing and we spent hours finding supplies only to get lit up by some camper on a mountainside across the map who didn t even have us in his sights I like it But I upgraded my motherboard and graphics card and the game crashes on start up I even reinstalled it and everything else i could find to do and still it crashes I would like to recommend it but no not until i can LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing play it again There s nothing else I can do besides downgrading my system and I d really rather not,negative
This is one of those games that I actually spend time to playI have never actually encountered a hacker  even though people say there are way too muchand the gameplay is just amazingNow that the game is optimized it feels even more smoother and even runs at 30fps on my ultrabook that is running gt 940mx as it s graphics cardSo all I can say is BUY THIS GAME AND DONT REGRET IT,positive

This game is supposedly launched clearly by a developer that doesn t understand that you dont  launch  a game when there are still so many bugs i do enjoy the game but most of the time i feel frustrated small things like randomly exploding on your bike while driving over a bridge in the first map i mean not even the second map the bloody first one And then the countless times where you shoot into things right infront of you but they not in your fov like a little hump infront of you or a window pane where you are already  leaning past  ,negative

PLAYERUNKNOWN S MILKINGGROUNDS This isn t a game it s an exercise in just how dry you can milk your customers whilst they happily continue the pursuit of scamRNG useless customization items It s good fun but the business practices are literally soulless Boycott it He s made enough money yet insists on giving us zero free customization and makes us grind to get BS 999  of the time Oh and expects us to pay for these measly customization items I love this game but I wouldn t reccommend it Far better BR games will be out soon enough,negative
Great game but a bit glitchy in places,positive
I love this and also really hate this game It basically boils down to a few thingsGameplay is quick intense visceral in many cases Very addictive and easy to go round after round with a few friends it s a blast However if I had to describe the current state of pubg it would be Great concept fun gameplay when it works but awful devs truly awful devs Cheating is fine  as long as you are happy to buy multiple copies of the gameThe cheating situation is out of control People seem to accept that using  no recoil mouse macros is a minimum requirement for this game and their use is rampant along with other cheats Last straw for me is a prolific streamer  not mentioning names who if you removed the name and it was deathcam footage you would no doubt say they were cheating yet seems to be accepted as ok I don t watch streamers really but if they are blatantly cheating out in the open and that s fine I don t want to play a game where the community and devs are apologetic towards cheatersAdd to that horrible optimisation patch after patch that breaks things over and over A complicit attitude towards or ineptitude to deal with the cheating situation this game will be dead within months unless something is done rather quicklyI hope they sort it out because as I said I do love this game I just want to play it without the rampart cheating At this point I cannot reccomend this game to anyone looking to buy it The cheating and horrible optimisation really do outweigh an otherwise amazing game,negative
4 hours were pretty much enough for me to see how many cheaters are there,negative
Fun game And an intersting footnote in video game history Sadly it will most likely be looked back on as an example of  when a dev figured the loot box economy was worth more than the gameplay This game has become all but unplayable after launch The amount of cheating is staggering Dev has no buisness motive to stop it since banned accounts promted more new game purchases by people cheating to farm looted boxes then selling lootboxes for cash Around and around it goes with the only losers being people who wanted to actually play the game Like as a game,negative

PUBG is a 100 player battle royale game with intense battles aswell as realistic gun mechanics  atleast more than fortnite Pros It is an intense 100 man battle royale in which players have to scavenge weaponry and various items in order to help lower the chance of them meeting their doom PUBG is extremely fun especially with companions to aid you in your endeavor of total dominance and survival It has a pre lobby with snakes and people singing which depicts a realistic depiction of mental illness and that China remains number one A team led by Sebastian  forsen  Fors won beating Michael  shroud  Grzesiek in the last invitaional of the game which as one of the best pros to be identified Forsen was quoted after the tournament telling Shroud to  just win  which is extremely inspirational Cons The game has been to be extremely rage inducing especially with incompetent team mates such as LoneWolf who focus on loot rather than reviving their team Yes there are not that many consThis review was created as a part of an IB CAS Project,positive
A junk game will only ban the game in error every time It does not take into account any player s feelings Even if it is mistakenly sealed it won t admit mistakes This kind of game will continue and the more people will be fewer and more expensive and Unreasonable banning will lose peoples hearts,negative

The game started out fun last year when it was in alpha still but the game feels like it is still yet in alpha haha The desync is worse than it has ever been you can shoot someone 10 times yet 3 of those rounds actually registered The maps still have major issues with loot spawning the strongest weapon in the game spawns more frequently than any other firearm in the game the crate weapons  which are suppose to entice you with their high damage and danger of going for the crate are the weakest weapons in the game the awm shoots a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 357 round that should litereally blow your head off or chest cavity but yet it takes 2 shots to kill someone in the head with it Makes sense bluehole as well as m24 is weaker than the sks the mk14 is weaker than a pistol The game developers of bluepoop corp have zero idea what they are doing cant smooth the maps out cant fix the desync on the servers because of all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chinese people Cant fix the cars so they wont randomly flip in the air grenades do little to no damage  All the so called  fix s  that have been made over the past few months are non existant The m16 s recoil got messed up and then a week later bluepoop came out and said they fixed it yet the recoil is still the same making it the worst gun in the game now haha Ridiculous All in all 010 for everything for this game and as you can see i have a decent amount of time in this game and im not bad as my rankings average from 1850 1950 which is fairly high but the game is no longer fun anymore end of story dont buy it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this company they dont care about the consumers at all  Please save your money,negative

Too many bugs still drove into a fence then the motorcycle flipped but it was a breakable fence I hadn t even seen a player yet so I suspect that this is the reason so many games go quietly Not only that but I just played a match had full health and got taken out by a cross bow bolt to the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing elbow,negative

Great Game best online multiplayer realistic shooter out there People have complained about some hackers glitch killing you but i have found hacker encounters were rare at this point since realese so it didnt detour me from enjoiying this game at all Sometimes as a player encounters another player in close quarters some lag could present its self giving the illusion of a hacked kill but was rare A death cam replay is offered when you die so you can see how your opponent killed you By watching the replay you can determine if they glitched hacked killing you at that point you have the option to report them Hacking and glitching are getting more rare as PUBG tries to combat hackers with updates This being said i do definitely recommend this game great game totally worth it  ,positive
The game was great in Early Access Since being out of Early Access it has undergone more maintenance during prime time hours  Eastern Time Zone I go to play this game about 3 4 times a week and it seems about 50  of that time I can t play because the game is down for maintenance when I want to play  9pm 12am EST I can t seem to understand why is this game down for maintenance way more than it ever was in Early Access and on top of that why are developers choosing prime time playing hours to take the game down for maintenance 0 stars Rushed out of Early Access Now in an arms race with Fortnite I want my money back,negative
better on the PC xbox version sucksssss,positive
Always shuts down servers during US prime time cause CHINA 1 yet xbox has updates early AM Tries to mimic Fortnite instead of addressing core issues Even EA could make better decisions than these guys3 hour maintenance and 25 mb downloads every other week for no changes to the biggest issues Loving weapon skins tho omg thx blueballs,negative

Worst game I ve played the most of,positive
After playing this fairly excessively I can honestly say I DON T recommend this game It really does have potential to be a solid game There s moments when the game can be incredible intense and also fun but in it s current state it s broken ESP and aimbot hacks are rampant  super blatant too and absolutely ruining any point of trying to play,negative
Something has to be done about the cheating,negative

This game company is too bad No matter how they ungrade the game the server is always bad Also there are always hackers in this game This game is fun to play but I also be LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up by this game so many times,negative
Alright its time for to review this gameAfter around 55 hours played i am still nowhere near getting bored of this game The whole point is for 100 people to drop down on an island and battle to the death until the last man or squad is standing And to be honest it is a fantastic concept The gameplay is fantastic and there is always loot to be found The rush of adreniline kicks in when you are in the top 10 as the circle is so small and people are all around you even if you cannot see them There is a lot more difficulty in shooting than other shooters as there is a ton of recoil and lots different fire options such as burst or single fire The only downside i have to this game is the optimisation It is absolutley terrible The Devs have acknoledged this within the last 24 hours and it is going to patched up soon but it is still wayyyyy overdue I have a gtx 1050ti and i can make it to 60 fps at high settings but it drops down 36 40 fps sometimes when i first land and then it rises up But anyway i enjoy this much better than fortnite  Fortnite is still fantastic though In my opinion this is the best battle royale shooter avaliableIn summaryPros   Good graphics Good gameplay  Fantastic gunplay Good mapsCons  Terribley optimised  make sure you have a good pc Extremely Loud  Mics in plane  can be turned offScore  95 out of 10,positive
EPIC GAME,positive

I regret getting this game It runs like trash crashes almost every time I try to open it to see if a recent update has optimized FPS  I get 10 15 FPS and my PC has double the recommended And the times I do get to actually play it the games are unbelievably unbalanced Fortnite is better it s free runs on more setups and isn t 100  luck like PUBG,negative

Fun game when the netcode works which is never,negative
Constantly crashes cheating is rampant has turned my friend group from jovial miscreants to irritable jagoffs Poorly programmed poorly optimized poorly conceived If you enjoy doing the same thing over and over for no particular reason other than a shallow sense of accomplishment at the subjugation of complete strangers and the possibility of rare cosmetic loot then this is the game for you,negative
How is this not in early accessPUBG has been a massive success on both PC and XBOX that same success is sure to follow on mobile platforms With all that in mind you would think they would prioritize polishing the game before adding fluff Improvements to the netcode are always welcome but they could also work on the perfomance Theres just no reason a GTX 1070 and an i7 proccessor cant run this game at a solid and consistent framerate These are 2 pillars that hold a multiplayer shooter up and should be ironed out well before implementing UI changes and lootboxes  both of which are functional enough as isOne day this will be a well oiled machine then again maybe not,negative
Its a great game and all however the bugs makes it unplayable at times The devs should be ashamed over the amount of money they are earning over this game Often times a game is ruined because you cant move in the start or the car decides its a rocket So great for a fun time but is way to broken to anything else,negative

I m trying to share my opinion on the game PlayerUnknown s BattlegroundsI ve been playing it for 34 year now and i lost the interest in the game because nearly every 3 matches you play theres at least one hacker Not to mention that the game is buggy as hell ALso BlueHole Studios the developers don t seem to care anymore because since the december update the 10 there hasn t been content added except for some new cosmetic items to make even more money I would say at the games current state it s not worth your 30 I m trying to update my review if theres new content added But all of that is just my opinion,negative

Great idea great potential superficially fun until you get aimbotted 5 matches in a row or go several hours without having a single english speaking squadmate Lag Spikes FPS drops lopsided matchmaking  if there even is matchmaking reduce this game to nothing but a shoddy game of hide and seek where you collect loot for the hackers that kill you Maybe if you play at the right time of day or night every now and then you ll have a fun match but they are not frequent enough to make up for the onslaught of frustration in between Meanwhile the developer continues to incentivise cheating by allowing loot crates to be bought and sold on the steam market and continuously coming up with more loot crates to keep the hackers hacking Whatever anti cheat is in place does nothing more than waste system resources You can report cheaters but you recieve no feedback For every obvious cheater you run into there are 9 more who are more subtle and it completely undermines any confidence in the game being a test of skill It s a 810 game until the honeymoon period is over and you realize what is going on then it s 210 Do Not Buy,negative

A Battleroyal with everything you needButIt s badly devlopped too much hackers too much chinese players on EU and NA serversIt s not optimized Aiming isn t aiming in PUBG Try it and you will understand meIt s more about luck and more luck to not encounter cheatersGame seemed to be fun but the only fun part was and is in the waiting lobbysDriving a vehicule feels like skateboarding down a cliffTOO MUCH BUGSIn Squad matches most of the team players don t chat with youOh PUBG is like other Battleroyal GAMES it s only about selling loot crates That s the only thing that keeps them to update the game but not to correct it and optimize it  Bugs Cheaters and i don t speak chineseI mean every other player speaks somehow english but not the chinesesIt s still an alpha but with loot and just a massive Battleroyal trend which younger people call ForkNightOh And some of the hackers are selling cosmetics for over 200I guess you understand my review,negative
This game has been overtaken by cheaters Devs need to learn how to ban hard and soon I will be unistalling and forgetting about this game until this is fixed,negative
For sure the best game Ive ever bought Great combat great graphics great everything I would recommend this game to anyone if everyone wasnt hung on fortnite,positive
One of my favorite games sure it cost money but it is a lot better than Fortnite,positive
Ehh If I m being honest I ve held off on giving a proper opinion on this game for a while now It s pretty damn buggy for an  official release  fresh content rolls out at a snail s pace and the latency is sometimes severe at best But it s fun  The developers seem to have put a severe dent in the hackers or at the very least forced them to be somewhat subtle about it Cheating was the biggest issue I ve had in this game and they seem to have mitigated that problem quite a bitIf you like this kind of game I don t really see a reason  not  to recommend it It s not flawless by any standard but I ve easily gotten my money s worth out of it If you don t like the genre you should probably pass,positive
it suck sooo much dont buy plz,negative
The game is not finished and not worth 27 It has bugs sometimes connection issue and most of the players are hackers Don t buy this game at least not yet,negative

This is honestly one of the better more adept games made as of late Of course it has its bugs and issues as does any other early access game that isn t fully developed but it is still a beautifully crafted and made game I would genuinely recommend this to just about anyone who enjoys any third person or first person shooter had they not already heard of it or own it,positive

While this game is endless fun for you and friends the absolute refusal of the developers to instill a ping lock to keep well known hack players out of the North American servers heeds a thumbs down review from me It is widely known and understood the vast majority of players from Asia play on NA servers with either blatent modifications to their game or pings so high it s worthless to match them A simple ping lock would fix this issue for millions of players yet the devs refuse Why have a marketplace or community for a game that is so easily hacked  Why permit cross region play when ping is going to be an obvious drawback  Great game and fun concept especially with friends Terrible operation of servers update implementation  7pm PST  Seriously  and an obvious disdain for their playerbase with the refusal to ping lock the regions,negative

Gameplay is great and fun and you will spend many hours playing the game but already after 24h you will start to notice how this game stutters FPS drops from 140 to like 40 every now and then game is full of some stupid bugs close combat is just terrible system req for it are just funny as hell since graphics are really bad At first it will be exciting but later on it just gets on your nervs and you start to regret buying this game Just skip it not worth 30 unless you want to google search  pubg not smooth enough   pubg fps drop  etc and read some stupid  solutions  you will be spending more time reading how to fix the game then playing it Too bad I didn t refund it when I still could,negative
Game is poorly optimized and loot boxes The maps dont have much verity So i cant realy recomend Pubg and 30  no to expensive But it can if ya dont take it seriesly and just try to mess around not being competetive,negative

Pretty fun game to play with friends But if you want to play with random squads you should probably learn Chinese because nobody speaks English 710,positive
A great game trapped inside a mediocre gameThe idea behind the game and the base mechanics are quite fun and this game is great with 1 3 friendsHowever there are definitely some issues with the game namely  Objective issues Hackerscheaters Bugginess  I might never load into the game at all I might get stuck on something in game etc Still needs optimization work Subjective issues Loot dispersion Game timing  Fast paced at the beginning then walkingdriving for 10 minutes then fast paced at the end While this occurs across the board in the BR genre I think it is exacerbated in PUBG A new 4x4 km map could certainly remedy this situation and is in developmentIt gets a lot right but it still needs a lot of fixingI d still recommend buying it since it s a really fun BR game  and I prefer its style over the cartoonish trampoline shotgun simulator that is Fortnite,positive

Used to be a great and promising game in Early Access phase Surprisingly developers keep making it worse listening to wrong feedback and implementing many disappointing tweaks Apart from general lags and lots of hackerscheaters the graphics became disgustingly colorful Mexico was a questionable choice for a second map who the hell needs  Emotes  in a game like this and now they proudly  Removed ambient noise and lowered the overall volume  so you play in acoustic vacuum With this level of faulty decisions the game should be dead soon,negative
This game has grown tremendous amount of popularity for the battle royale genre but sadly the devs of this game don t care about its actual gameplay but instead continue to milk the game for money I bought this game about a year ago having a first go at it having 30 fps on lowest settings and not liking the gameplay Started to come back to the game recently and since I ve come back they ve not seemed to fix any of the lag or desync but now there also seems to an issue with cheaters and Chinese people being forced to play on western servers because of the amount of cheaters on the Asian serversPeople post almost everything about this game to region lock China so they cant ruin the experience for the western players but then the Chinese that play fairly and want to win have no chance of doing so This game needs to fix its hacking epidemic optimize the game engine and stop making useless updates like emotes,negative

This game still has enough cheaters bugs and overall lack of polish for such a popular  and profitable game It is fun when you have a good group but the positive experience is often tainted by the negatives I do recommend that any potential buyers read up on other complaints before paying full price This review is subject to change depending on the future of the game,negative

The extreme number of people using blatant hacks is just beyond excuse  If you WANT to play for 20 minutes and get headshotted by a guy with a crossbow 1000m away who doesn t even have line of sight to you while you re riding a motorbike at 130kph over bumps and hills then this game is for youWithout a word of a lie I would play 5 games encounter BLATANT hacking in one of those games  Their anti cheat measures can be circumvented faster than the devs can  poorly write them,negative
Until they fix all of the bugs that has been in the game for months do not get this game Crashes and random disconnects REally bad character controll engine and horrendous gunplay,negative
This game is something else Ridiculously popular and for good reason It s something fresh and relatively new and well executed I can t talk about this game without talking about the repercussions of it s crazy popularity which you ve seen as you browse these reviews Put something new in front of millions of eyes and you ll find that millions of players who don t want this type of game have bought it and are playing it despite it not being the type of game they want to play All these negative reviews are absolutely not indicative of the game as it plays today I m fairly convinced that all these people complaining about performance and hackers are just your garden variety internet trolls who haven t played the game in months BlueholePUBGCorp has made massive strives in improving performance and reliability while doing their best to combat the flood of low pinghigh hacks Chinese players that for a while were pervasive in NA servers I ve put in a lot of hours into this game many recently and in the past 2 3 weeks I haven t seen a single hacker and have been matched with relatively few non communicative players The pace of improvement is better than nearly any recently released game on Steam and in addition to adding crucial QoL improvements like ping based matching and hack detection  and bans they are still forging ahead with new content like new maps weapons animations and tweaks Onto the game itself  it s taken the best parts of ARMA and packed them into a new ish format called Battle Royale where 100 players land on the island with no equipment scavenge and kill each other as the great wall of death closes in till one is left It s just that simple but it s given me countless hours of fun and excitement There are few games out there that consistantly entertain me like plunkbat does the tension and excitement you ll get here is like nothing else out there atm For 30 I ve gotten my money s worth 100x over The pacing is slower than something like CoD or CS GO the maps are open world style and it requires a completely different type of skill than a  pure  shooter like the above mentioned In CoD style games it s all about mechanical skill and speed and rote repetition of knowing the maps knowing your gun and being faster and more precise than the other team In PUBG those things are still true but because people start in different locations each time and are forced to move to a different end location each time knowing the map is less important Because you get only the guns and equipment you find knowing your gun is less important What PUBG creates is the opportunity for a smarter player to flourish as adaptability becomes most important You might not have a ton of experience with the weapons you have you might not know the terrain you re fighting on or how many enemies you re facing and you need to be able to adapt to those ever changing conditions to win That s what the haters are talking about when they say  RNG  and they hate it because they re used to pure shooters where they can practice their approach with a given weapon 1000 times to get the drop on someone who hasn t So don t listen to the haters If you want a pure arena shooter this isn t what you re looking for If you want something new and exciting where you ll get a different fight every time you play where you won t know what s waiting for you around the next corner and where you ll use your wits as well as your skill to come out on top of 99 other players this is where it s at,positive

I get the same adrenaline buzz I used to get playing CS 16 competitively when you re the last one alive and you know your whole team is watching you That massive thrill transported into a huge battlefield map I reckon this game takes the very best of the counterstrike and battlefield series  and mashes em together Also every update brings good changes   smoother optimisations better feeling movementIt s brutal gameplay it s definitely not for everyone but my god is it for meChinese hackers apparently plague the US servers    I ve played 200 hours in EU servers and encountered one hacker during that time,positive
My poor not because of the quality of the game to the blue hole but this small workshop attitude China hanging wall is our fault but you don t get your blue hole anti cheating instead of those of us ordinary game player and wall hanging together off the dark room to play a clean environment the effect is that the foreign game player so really comfortable but you have not thought about us every game we met a brother more likely how do we play  In my opinion this is not the renovation of the outside but a kind of lazy so attitude do not give bad reviews the stick will not be up to the sky ,negative

Don t bother with this game community is toxic trash  if they even spaek english devs dont have a clue constantly breaking more than they fix and this is meant to be now out of early access  yeah in name only this hot garbage is still a beta at best I even forgave the clear assest flipping because I figured they were just place holders lol nope we just get a vault mechanic which should have been there from the start to deal with assests that dont belong together the sad thing this game has so much potential but if the devs have done nothing but squander it up to this point that aint gonna change oh and dont forget the rampant cheating this game has,negative

Good game with quite the potential to be special However after some time playing the game feels pretty meh The upcoming map is good in my opinion Yes there are some cheater in the game but it s not as rampant as people say though it would be very annoying if you encounter oneRecommend if you have friends to play withIf you play by yourself it will become a bit boring after 100 hours,positive

You think that they would actually adress some major issues in the game before their official  release  On in particular I am fond of is the parachute propblem where you get stuck in the air right before you re about to drop and get your weapon It s amazing that at the most crucial part of the game where you re completely volnurable and unarmed there is such a bug that will completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you over Kind of feels bad when you drop at the cartel drug mansion on the mexican map and you get stuck in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing roof while all your enemies scramble to find weapons When you finally get unstuck and see that glowing mini 14 with 3 boxes of 556 and a slight bit of hope the you get one pumped buy some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with an s12 because he was able to get a gun before you Terrible game Don t waste your money,negative
Cant stop playing it,positive
Not as Good as I expected it to beProsI do like the bare concept of the game 100 people drop into a map scattered with gear and the name of the game is find gear and eliminate all the other players until there is only 1 remaining The  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  at the end of a game is also pretty nice The game is quite good visually I run a GTX 1050 on a Dell Inspiron 7000 and have no issues with the games sounds or graphics The UI is quite easy to navigate too The weapons are realistic and gun damage is pretty consistant to each particular weapon Bullet drop adds an extra factor into shooting as you cannot shoot someone from 500m away just by aiming at them unless you change your zeroing distance The game is also great for people to spectate too Twitch streamers have blown up with popularity while playing this game Not to mention the E Sports community that is building in popularity tooConsAfter playing over 100 hours of PUBG I can say that from a technical standpoint this game needs alot of work on the back end  Server stutter is a real big problem You get behind a tree you ve been there for at least half of a second and then you pop back out from behind the tree because the server didn t catch up Not to mention the irritation of not being able to use voice chat because chinese players leave an  open mic  on all the time and all you hear is the background noise from their gaming cafe they are in Like 250 voice all yelling at once in a foriegn language is rather annoying so I reccomend just muting the  All  voice chat all together Another BIG issue they seem to have is with hackers Alot of American players are calling for a  Region Lock  of the chinese players to keep them in their own servers and I can t say that I blame them I m still not sure why they decided to allow players to play on other countries servers It isn t good for connection quality and not knowing the language just makes for a bad play environment The hackers jump from region to region for reasons I do not know but I do know that PUBG does not seem to take this issue as seriously as it s playerbaseDiscussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorYes the majority of cheats come out of China but that doesnt mean all Chinese players are cheaters This idea that just because youve got a few bad eggs youve gotta ban a whole country is a bit reactiveNo one is claiming that ALL chinese players are cheater but from my expirience of the chinese players that are not cheating they are screaming in broken english about how america should die and that how  China Number One  Another issue I have with the game is that you cannot add people to your steam friends list after playing a random que duosquad game If I meet someone and they are a decent person and a good player I d like to add them to my friends list but I can t within the game I have to ask them for their steam ID tab out  which often crashes the game all together and open steam to add them It s rather more complicated than it needs to be ConclusionPUBG is a visually stunning game that still has quite a few issues to resolve if it wants to stay at the pinnacle of steams Battle Royal charts With free games like Fortnite allowing players a better expirience for free I d say the only thing keeping players to PUBG is it s realisting look and strategy If PUBG could fix the issues I ve seen and heard about they could be a real contender to be at the top for a long long time I don t see how a company worth BILLIONS with a B can still be facing these kinds of issues when there are games out there that are far less valuable in terms of how much money they make and how many people they have working for them making games with a better expirience on the technical end and clearly listen to what their players want Just seems like Bad Form All in all as of now I d give the game a 610 and would recommend it to people who would sacrifice overall expirience for visual realism,positive

I personally like the game HOWEVER sometimes this game finds a way to make me furious not by dying thats a different story but with the main mechanic shooting I swear to god i shoot people in close fights but i guess it doesnt i try shooting someone about 6 feet away using every bullet and i die and do not hit them once What  they really need to sort out their problems and while they do that i will go over to H1Z1 or Fortnite NOT TO MENTION FRAME RATE I have a core i7 and a gtx 1070 after the most recent update at very low settings at 720p i get like 20 fps WHY DO I NEED A NASA COMPUTER TO RUN THIS GAME   ,negative

This game is a 310 at best  It has the style FPS players crave but it falls short of almost every milestone it could hitGun Handling 510  Sadly in terms of FPS games this one comes in middle of the pack  There s nothing remarkable about it it s functional but nothing I m going to drop to my knees and suck off the developer forMaps 310  If we were valuing this one just the default map it d get a 610 or so the ewok battles Hiding behind trees thing dominates it but it s otherwise a pretty solid map  The desert map however is absolutely horrible  It s too big More often than not you re running from the blue zone too  hilly  and the towns are congested as sinHit Registration 310   Despite being in 2018 the net code for this game is trash  Be it lag bullet reg or what have you be prepared to see a  noticable  number of your shots to hit the dirt directly behind your target even if it s hardly movingBattle Royale 410   You d think a shooter with only one game mode would at least do it well  Instead we have Bluehole s attempt which is just shy of being pathetic  The Bombing Zone is completely unnecessary as it largely just serves to delay some unlucky people by 30  seconds or more because no one wants to dice it up and lose all their loot on a bad roll  The RNG of the circle can also be a massive pain and in the final circles can dictate whether you win or lose on the spot  Which seems odd that they d make balance changes increased blue damage for competitive play when no one in their right mind would classify such an RNG laddened game as an E sportGearing up 110   Truly awful  I don t expect it to rain M416s but when I go into a room and the designated loot pile is 4 backpacks stacked ontop of eachother or an entire 2 stack house filled with nothing but a couple extended mags and a crap ton of clothes you quickly realize Bluehole s loot algorithm is just a jokeBugs 210  Better than it was but still horrible  I ve crashed vehicles into gently sloped terrain had my bike flipped on me on perfectly flat terrtain stuck reloading crashed to desktop invisible buildings resetting controls and I could dedicate paragraphs if I kept listing all these off that it d be easier to just say  Google Pubg bugs   Some of these have been fixed most end up reappearing after every patchNew Player Experience 010   No way of practicing besides throwing yourself into the grinder no tutorial nothing  You will spend hours upon hours getting curb stomped until you manage to make it out alive in a decent drop point or drop in the middle of nowhere and spend just as many hours running around to fightCustomer Service 010   Bluehole has the worst customer support period  I have never seen or heard of a worse one  Here s the experience of one of my buddies   His game bugs as he s buying a crate he immediately goes to  4000 currency which he s then told by Bluehole support to suck it up and grind threw the defecit  Fast forward a few months he suddenly gets perma banned for running a QoL autohotkey script for his browser window which has no capacity to function in PubG  After requesting  support  he s basically run around in circles by Bluehole and Battleye support and his ticket gets closed despite nothing being done  I m tempted to give the game a 110 if for no other reason than that I absolutely despise bad supportI d continue but I don t expect people to read all this and I ve wasted about as much of my time as I m prepared to on such a subpar product,negative

POS game Read somewhere that they built the game on an engine that was never built to handle 100 live players Whether Its true or not I can definitely see the effectsThis is just the tip of the iceberg havent even got into hackers client  server sync issues etc The other 1000s of negative reviews can go into that There s only so many patches you can do to a 1977 Yugo Comes time to just get a new car,negative
Such a inconsistent unreliable game so many bugs and problems I wouldnt recommend this game unless you want to rely on a lot of luck helping your client send the right info to the server so you can win becuase most the time it wont and you will die from someone you shot 12 times after he walked over 5 of your grenades and through your invisible smoke,negative
This game concept is the actual best but when it comes down to it the game is not optimized enough to even be playable I will BARELY be peeking but in the death cam I will be way out in the open like an idiot On his screen from the death cam he will be way out in the open but on my screen in the game he was barely peeking like me Also apparently you have to shoot people in the forehead for a headshot but they can shoot you in the throat so if you are looking to buy I would say check videos and other sources to see how optimized this game is in its current state because right now march 2018 it is not even close to what it needs to be,negative
wack,negative
This game is  awesome On it s merits alone I d recommend this game to anybody that enjoys first person shooters but is sick of the same CoD  CS GO style action You drop in via parachute along with 100 other players getting to strategically choose where you start across gigantic maps and then you loot and survive However the reason I m writing this review is the same reason that as of this point I would NEVER recommend this game to somebody I liked   rampant cheating With each game consisting of you and nearly 100 other players having even 1  of the population hacking ruins nearly 100  of the matches Now I ve managed to get into some games where I m unaffected by it and have managed to win 10 or so in the 100 hours I ve played it But for each game I ve won I ve died 10 s of times to people blatantly cheatingThough the developer says they re  working on it  nothing seems to actually be  working Over the past 5 months or so the hacking has gotten just down right out of control I can t tell you how frustrating it is to get 20 minutes into a game with multiple kills a great load out and awesome end game position to have a hacker s crosshairs just magically jump to your head when your clearly not visible on their screen or have somebody shoot you with a scopeless gun from halfway across the map when you re lining up a sniper shot with an 8x or 15x scope This game has turned into something less about surviving the game as it was created and more about getting lucky to not run into hackers within the first 15 minutesOverall I love what the publishers are doing with the genre and the game itself but it really shows how inadequate or unwilling they are to solve any of these issues ruining an otherwise incredible experience Ruined so much so that again I d save your money if  you re thinking of buying this and wait until when  you type  PUBG Cheating  into Google you don t see a million horror stories and actually see signs of progress from the developer,negative
It was great until they added the desert mapRNG gives it to me about 70  of the time and the other 30  are the original mapNot worth the disgusting headache of the second mapEdit The second map is still bad but now they ve added a feature where you can filter out maps you don t want to playThat said this game now has my backing Super fun with friends  or alone if you re a cholo that rolls solo,positive

Utter garbage overhyped by wannabe streamersLow server tickrate desync problems  servers are too busy  error frame rate stuttering LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  anti cheat game breaking glitches sound bugs hit detection bugs no region lock no 71 Surround support RNG driven gunplayThe game depends approximately 70  on RNG so you can win the game if your loot and positioning is better even if you are a complete noob RNG may also force you to increase the versatility of your tactics and bring excitement to the game but that s about it It mostly drives you mad and takes away the fun and competitiveness of the game completely anyhowOverall it s not worth it It s a mere lootbox selling simulator and the only reason that it is popular is Twitch,negative

Avoid at all costs especially to your own wallet as this game has so many hackers that the dev team bragged about banning 1500000 players for it over 1000000 since the beginning of 2018 yet there doesn t appear to be any slowing down to the trendIt s a 30 game made by a small dev team that has no real content to itWhy  Best of all they are rolling out LOOT BOXES despite ALL of the issues,negative

This Game is amazing it is a game that will you will rage and will fill you with fun and excipment from running over your teamate to having three bubbies spectate you will you clutch up a 4v1 and getting the chicken dinner I have 1300 hours on this game and 1299 hours i have had fun playing I would choose PUBG over fortnite any day and if you have the 3000 and a good anough pc you are missing out if you spend that money on the new daily items,positive
Game sucks Bois Doesn t matter if you hide behind walls are on the other side of walls or on the other side of a city Some way Some how you will be shot by a man wearing a leopard print skirt  and a P9 with the hacks of The Anonymous orginazation BlueHole or whatever the company is just wants your money Thats why you have to pay 5 dollars to open a crate that ll probably give you a nice red shirt or blue jeans Soul sucking designers like this who resort to making money off microtransactions and not the selling of the game are the reason gaming sucks these days If you buy it have a great time wasting your money,negative
Hoo boy this game is controversial It is a realistic 100 player battle Royale I personally genuinely enjoy the game Despite the fact I am terrible it is a fun adrenaline filled game that takes some time to learn how to play Bugs are widepsread and common but devs are not focusing on this at the moment mostly because of Fortnite Because Fornite is free it has reached a higher playerbase than PUBG which is unsurprising to be sure Fortnite is appealing to more moderate gamers and people new to shooters for it s silly graphics and usability PUBG is the superior game however only more competitive or experienced gamers will aspire to play this again and again It s devs definitely need to work on the bugs in the game but overall I would say this is one of my favorite games at the moment810 would recommend to get this on sale,positive
In all honestly I love this game Something about it feels so smooth and it keeps drawing me in But in all honesty this game is horribly imbalanced and that is a problem I cannot tell you how many times I have left enemies with zero visible health in the deathcam or how many times i ve outgunned people but somehow they magically take a quarter damage This is seriously a problem considering the fact that I can shoot an enemy twice as much and they manage to maintain half health where I seem to miracously die from the same gun im using with higher level armor and full health Please fix this and make this game more enjoyable,positive
Very fun game tho i wish they added more types of guns on the maps like more Asault Rifles and snipers that would be cool Also bump up the amount of CC you get in each match a little bit too Other then that i give 1010,positive

PUBG is a fun battle royale game Many people say it is very buggy while true this does not stop you from enjoying this challenging game Every update makes this game better I see a great future ahead,positive
Let s start this off by saying that PUBG can without question be an extremely fun game whether you re messing about with your friends in squads or getting a lovely chicken dinner the possibilities for playing different playstyles within the game were plentiful  Challenges like Crossbow only or having to complete certain objectivesThat being said the game is still heavily flawed and in the biased opinion of a player the developers appear to be focusing more on adding new cosmetics granting them more money than on fixing the plethera of bugs and glitches present in the game Especially the latest update truly shows that off with the game having been rendered completely unplayable crashing my PC whenever I start it After doing virtually everything within my grasp such as updating drivers verifying the game files and even outright reinstalling the game nothing worked Even before the update I could barely achieve a consistent framerate with my admittedly mediocre at best PC a further piece of evidence that the game still needs to be optimised heavily and is absolutely not esports readyIn conclusion if you are looking for a fun game have a decent PC and are okay with dying regularly to the stupidest things you will see in your entire gaming career get this game But this recent update is now making me seriously consider switching to a game infinitely more polished and streamlined in comparison,negative
why ,negative
GarbageThis game is a buggy unpolished mess Totally unfinished and you can tell Not worth your money I regret every second I ve played 05,negative
Straightforward Review I am writing this review as of 24 hours of recorded in game time Don t judge too much pls XPPUBG is fun and i really mean FUN while retaining the  challenging  aspect of a competitive game The exciting feeling when playing this game makes it fun storming into houses getting stormed finding nothing but trash finding level 3 armour and helmet in one spot airdrops landing right above you sniping random people running head first into a bullet hard carrying teammates feeding getting high on discord to my own embarassment etc etcStealth aim prediction game sense positioning strategy teamwork coordination and even luck are all factors that PUGB tests you in  maybe not luck because that cannot be tested from person to person   its randomBut definitely play this game with your friends because that makes it more fun by 10 foldsDespite the occasional hacker mopping the floor with my entire team  by occasional i mean like 1 out of 20 games i still think PUBG is worth my money Ironically i didn t want to buy it at first but my friends convinced me so thanks guys No regrets,positive
After like 30 hours on this game i quit becuase of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t hit detection and server issues and                                     ,negative
Yeah nah the game has been slowly getting worse and worse Cheating is rampant and it seems the devs are getting desperate in their attempts to stop it not inherently a bad thing but now it means that there are random bans for players who aren t cheating In addition to this with the new update it s left thousands unable to play the game  myself included and by play the game I mean that it won t even launchIt s a shame the game was really fun to begin with Now it s the devs just adding more microtransaction ish contentRiparoonee,negative

after spending 140 hours on this game and rage quitted several games DON T buy this game after it came out of development state and became PUBG 10 all the developer ever thought of is the cosmetics money grab and almost no more bug fixes even when the game still have more bugs than its features Bullets disappearing midflight when fighting close combat melee system that only hit crosshair area  it has sweeping hit motion etc etc,negative
dont kill streamers,negative
Probably the worst decision of my life was to buy this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Not a great fan of the shooting mechanics the game is slow paced and boring most of the time  Server issues are straight up bad  optimization is poor the game desyncs like crazy ,negative
I like it dont be a whiny LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  theres some issues but i have faith it will be worked out everyone thinks theyre a programmer and knows what to fix and how to fix it and how fast it should be fixed but you dont know LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  so dont play it if you dont like it dont sit here and play it and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about it,positive
I m not sure if devs are new to their job or they re just straight up garbage Good game bad devs Don t buy this game if you don t like getting cucked by devs,negative
banned my friend for  cheating  then when he asked why ur like  we can t tell you cuz we don t know  WTF  The game is also full of bugs and really needs worked on as well as using the cheat system correctly,negative
Fortnite is a better optimized free alternative Apart from the start of the matches and the end of the matches this game is a running simulator,negative
At first the game seemes fun and good but as you start playing more and more you encounter a lager amount of cheaters The fun goes out the window when you and your friends gets sniped by some hacking nerd killing you with hipfire from 300 meters away1010 would get destroyed by 9 year old again,negative
I think that they made a good job when they implemented 10The game gets better and better ,positive
I ve got about 500 hours logged in this game now You ll hear a lot of mixed reviews from people Some saying they hate the game and others saying that they love it If you wondering if you should truly purchase the game or not then these are my thoughts after the amount of gameplay I ve logged here I think in terms of actual gameplay balance PUBG has one of the most balanced combat systems I ve played Its true that their is some luck or RNG  Random Number Generator involved in the loot that you receive but if you study the game and take the time to learn the maps and learn the weapons there is nothing that is specifically more overpowered than the other selections available to you Different scenarios and locations call for different weapon loadouts While there may be more favored weaponry for their ease of use or their fluidity you always have the potential to find kills with anything if you re accurate enough and position correctly People need to understand that luck and randomness is a factor in the game one that you can t always account for For as many times as I ve received horrible loot and not gotten a good weapon early on I ve probably equally found great loot and a good loadout for the rest of the matchJust like almost any multiplayer videogame you ll play your success is relative to your skill and gameknowledge If you don t take the time and effort to learn more about the game and try new things then you probably won t get very far and wind up wondering why you re not good at it If you want something casual that takes minimal effort to learn and become good at then there s always run and gun shooters like Call Of Duty PUBG is a Battle Royale game which like all Battle Royale games revolves around being the last player alive Whether through passive playstyle or aggressive playstyle the ultimate goal is making better choices than all of your opponents and coming out on top You won t instantly be good at the game it takes time to learn things and it takes time to discover what works best for you When it comes to the concern of hacking in the game and the constant complaints of cheating that you read throughout anything related to the game I can say that in my 500 hours and 1000 matches I have rarely if ever encountered cheating in any First Person mode Possibly a couple of times  To read some of these reviews and complaints you would think that these people struggle to find a match without one Maybe that s true for Third Person game modes  Which I don t play out of preference but that s just me personally but if you choose to play First Person I struggle to even think of a match where I encountered a hackercheater Now for the bad parts of the game and the developers themselves  Vehicles and Terrain   Some of the vehicle physics and coding leaves something to be desired 10 minutes on youtube looking up clips of weird interactions will tell you all you need to know about that There is often weird things that happen with the vehicles and I don t think they were ever coded in properly But still I ll defend the fact that my personal experience with this is far and few in between It has happened to me and I ve seen it happen but I can easily go 30 matches without any issues As for the terrain most of it is coded in well once you ve finally landed and the render has caught up I have a decent computer  Maybe lacking a little bit in RAM at only 8GB but I have a good processor and a GTX 1070 but sometimes I struggle initially in cities or places with high concentrations of players rendering buildingsfurniture fully This can have an impact on my gameplay as sometimes the most crucial seconds between living or dying are decided on who gets to weapons first Aside from optimization concerns for varius PC s and specs  Even with customized low settings I find the rest of the map to be stable and without issue  Maps  The game had modes like fog and rain enabled to help break up the pace of the game but they were removed I think that the game either needs new modes whether it be fog rain night etc or more maps in general There s a lot of dislike for the desert map in the community which leaves a much needed change in pace very soon  User Interface  The client of this game is awful and one of the few things I will never defend because of how bad it truly is Simple things that no other game or developer has struggled with seem to have completely eluded Bluehole    Ready Check bugging out when queued with a party requiring everyone to try and figure out who s lobby is bugged and forcing restarts   Game crashing upon load in Either freezing you out completely or just flat out crashing to desktop  While they have recently resolved the majority of issues for this it was a problem that should never have made it to a  Fully Released  game   Game freezing if you try and alttab during load in screen    No integration of an in game friends list or direct links to steam profiles No way to see recently played with people Having to refresh the steam friends list UI just to see when people come online Inconsistency in people genuinely being offline or just in a match    Not having a server maintence message I know that this may seem like more of a personal pet peeve than a user interface issue but there s absolutely no reason that I should receive the same  Servers are too busytry again later  message for when they actually are and for when its maintence time I never understood why I then have to open up the social media pages to look for the message about server maintence Community and Developers   While I approve of the gameplay and if you re someone who only truly cares about how much fun you ll have with the game from gameplay alone then feel free to skip this part but be warned the community and gameplay SHOULD go hand in hand Bluehole gets a lot of hate for the way that they interact and deal with their community and I think rightfully so These game developers seem to forget that their success is centered around how happy their community is and how well their product is being received If you choose to ignore what you customers are saying and not make steps and strides to addressing their concerns then you re going to crash and burn when someone else does it better Bluehole continues to release new content micro transactions and patches that don t address any of the key concerns of its playerbase Failure to look listen to what your community is saying to you will and is driving a lot of players away from the game Not only that but rushing to release this content and misc things without fully testing them just leads to more hate If you go on the twitter account for PUBG its almost comical how you ll ALWAYS see an apology or PR statement about an issue IMMEDIATELY after a patch is implemented Including one mistake so huge that it literally made the game unplayable for everyone until they resolved the issue These patches should never be released to live serversI think that after the amount of money that they have made the devs and owners have completely lost touch with their fanbase and are prioritizing the wrong things While I completely disagree with their handling of these issues and their proccess s I don t think that it takes away from the average gameplay Overall I think that while the game faces a lot of issues in its communitydeveloper relations and in my personal opinion should never have been classified as a  Fully Released  game I still enjoy it immensely and think its very fun to play The majority of my complaints have to do with the development team and staleness of the game in there only being 2 maps with no variation in the atmosphere of either  FogRainNight etc Its easy to get burnt out on the game quickly when there s no way to break up the monotone feel of the matches,positive
 I should probably get to bed guys  3 hours pass WHERE WE DROPPING BOYS ,positive

This game is extremely laggy since launchedI also got temporary banned for no reason If some players are little good at this game then it doesn t mean all are cheating I guess I got reported from many noob players I even sent email to this game support saying if anybody can prove I m cheating then banned me forever and take ligal action which never going to happen because there is no cheat This game devlpoers are sucks they can t even recognized who is cheating and whos not They said I m using 3rd party cheat softwear lol are you kidding me   1st you need to fix your game with money you have then work on losers I mean hackers,negative

As somebody who is nearing 100 hours where I end up playing this game with frinds in squads I truely enjoy the gameplay of this game It is worth the cost because I ve made my money back on what I spent on this game I ve probably make 15 profit off this game which I ended up using it to buy DLC for other games in my libary I do enjoy this game at it s core,positive
This is  Hunger Games like  online game The thrills the graphics all realistic two thumbs up,positive
PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game with a small budget to start with Now that they ve made many millions  close to a billion on PC sales alone all they see is money They no longer care about player experience Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it Mistakes  poor decisions    First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on It wasn t designed for 100 players so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates There are better engines that can handle 100 players but I guess they went with the cheaper solution  Client side hit detection This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping  No region lock or ping lock They talked about implementing this months ago but now you re racist or  xenophobic  toward Chinese people if you want this feature Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection  Lootboxes Everything about them Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over 1k on the marketplace Huge incentive for cheaters since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with They also just came out with locked lootboxes so you play to get your points to get the rewards and then you have to pay 3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents  current price on the marketplace  Not really banning cheaters Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playingcheatingselling and the cycle continues Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this  They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player  STEREO sound what year is this    Some  minor  issues with game design that could be easily fixed like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest slowing the circles down a bit etc But compared to the above points these are pretty minorWhat would make this game better    Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate  Server side hit detection  only works well with a good server tickrate  Actually ban cheaters  IP MAC address etc I know there are ways around it but it s not as easy as just buying another copy of the game  Sell rare items like the schoolgirl uniform for example Lots of people like being able to selltrade things on the marketplace so keep that if you must but if Bluehole sold items themselves  even just the rare items it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like 50 they would make millions Win win for everyoneIf they had their own store for selling cosmetic items they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game and they wouldn t care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff  Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up theirLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I will never buy a key to open one and I won t sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward greedyLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Region  Ping lock There are servers in every major region why do people need to play on a server that s on the other side of the world  If the game had server side hit detection having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn t be as big of an issue   Surround sound Good positional audio is important in any FPSIf they made these changes I would recommend this game but we re more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happensWhy is it so popular then  It s exciting really gets the adrenaline pumping You start with nothing and there s no respawn so everything you do matters and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you   where to drop what to loot how long to spend looting where to go when to go there when to fight when to flee etc Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different Option to go solo duo or squads each mode changing the way you play the gameAll of this makes for a fun and addicting game until you die to a cheater or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover  or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window sill etcThe most frustrating thing about all that is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game how greedy can you get  They don t want to regionping lock because they don t want to offend the Chinese and they make a lot of money from them especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China That s not racism that s factThere are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers many of them are cheaters some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters but they still have an advantage due to their high ping 005  of them are there to play with their friends in NA and that s the main reason Bluehole said they don t want to regionping lock In squads and duo s where communication is very important it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say  China numba wun Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game This just seems to be a very short sighted money grab when it could easily be a long term revenue stream,negative

What can i Say well the game itself could probably be fun BUT the developers are insanely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  They work against the community at any circumstances Its like EA published this game and when you played EA games as  Heroes of might and MAgic  for example you absolutely know what I am talking about right now Here are the most significant argues  Cheater over Cheater over Cheater I face Cheater every 2nd game at the moment there is nothing more frustrating to be in a game 20 minutes with epic equipment and loot and then BAM getting killed by no recoil aimbots all over and mostly by xianchau12231  some chinese people  Bugs over Bugs over Bugs you arte going to start the game with bugs and probably you will finish it with bigs Even those which are in the game since it got relesased even since alpha The programmers oif this game got no clue about the things they are doing After new patch releases the game keeps beeing unplayable for atleast 1 day Dunno what they are using their testservers for But they are obvioulsy kinda LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   anti community devs whatever the community wishes is refused Just for whatever reason Examples  Map choose There a 2 Maps ingame one is awesome one sucks hard But you are forced to play both of them they get choosen randomly This causes atlat 10 leavers at any map due to the reason that they want to play the other one GJ devsRegion lockyou know there are soooo many chinese cheater out there And not only that you are in advantage when you play with higher ping du to the engine So If you are playing this play not at your region and you dominate much more GZ Devsand many morethe only positive part I earned all my money back by selling those stupid crates for 2 each at the beginning AND sometimes its fun to play as 4 people when there are no  cheater ingame Whats kinda rare actually,negative

Well I thought id give this game a chance before I wrote a review So here it finally is  This Game started out to be pretty cool with quick load in time and some fun game play and free loot creates to get some different skins etc well thats how it started out anyway Now this game has become very slow to load into a server sometimes it wont even find a server if your on OC servers that is anyway Every day you might find yourself halfway into a game doing well getting all the guns and loot you need then all of a sudden your game will crash Next thing you know you have a randon 260Mb update which seems to happen multiple times a day Also as much as they say they are cracking down on hackers its still full of them Another thing that really gets up my nose is the micro transactions There seems to be more and more loot creates that now require a key to open sounds like a great idea right Well the drops are really rubbish and most of the items you get will be in the market place for like 008c doesnt make much sence when you ve just spent 385 for a key to open it The way i see this game going at the moment even if you do get a good create with something worth a bit of money the way this game is going the item will eventually be worth nothing In my eyes these type of company s are just getting to greedy and it needs to stop As for Game Play when it is running well it can be fun especially with a few mates to run around and try and have a good laugh at the start when i first purchased it and the Dev s were all about the game and making sure it was running well it would of highly recommended this game But now id probably say hold your money and wait for the next call of Duty to come out and hope they do a far better job with their servers and actually care about what the Gamers have to say Lol who am i kidding Call of Duty Devs are almost as bad But id say wait for the next best thing to this as i feel this is turning out to be another H1Z1 and will end up dieing very soon if the Dev s dont sort their crap out quickly,negative

Top game Excitement plus  Nice randomness with respect to how the game is played Spend a lot of time collecting items and moving only to be shot by a hack spoiler  These people remove grass and can lock on with headshot kills with utmost speed and  accuracy with any  weapon  Unfortunately happens too often now so if you get to the top 15 without being killed by a hacker you have done well  Excluding the hackers one on one battles are exceptional fun and can leave youbreathless  Top 9 1010 game if you can get rid of the hackers  With hackers probably 510 as they do really waste your time and effort,positive

I would recommend this game to everyone because its just the best game in entire Steam  But the only thing am not happy about the developers of this game is that they are not taking any action against hackers  Its not only china that is full of hackers  there are many people across the world violation the terms and conditions  I would humbly request the developers of PUBG to take strict control of such cheaters in game I would not like to blame only China for all the trouble but there are many more hackers who need to be punished ,positive
Toxic Community your teammate will insult you just because they had bad games or they just want to be entertained by making fun of youThere are also hacker problem of courseAlso if you are medicore at shooting dont bother you will just act like a mailman deliver package to people either hacking or talented at shooting which the match making will not seperate them from you,negative

Pros  Huge world Up to 100 people in each game Plenty of weapons everywhere Great variety of weapons Weapons sound great Explosions sound great Graphics good for this type of game Tense as hell especially when you re in the final 10Cons  Got that buggy feel that Arma games always seem to have Like when you try to aim your gun and shoot through a window but the game decides you re too close to the window to be able to aim even though you re not too close to it Hitting the tiniest stone whilst driving a vehicle can launch you into space Funny but it s a bug HackersConclusion The whole planet is playing this game there s no point in me even writing this review,positive

Wanna play a buggy mess that is full of chinese hackers that a company doesnt want to seperate  even though they are litterally 46  of the playerbase   99  of convicted cheaters Play this,negative
This game sucks I went into this expecting to hear a lot Bobby Schmurda s hit song  hot LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I was very disapointed when it came to my realization that this song was not present within the game nor was it present with any addons or cosmetic items 010 dont buy this game,negative
This game sucks the map is far too large for 100 people most games you ll spend about 20 minutes running across the map only for someone to snipe you as you desperately escape the storm which by the way cvomes way too quickly,negative
This game is utter garbage At best this game should still be in early release Just sloppy sloppy development There are too many issues to even list here How can this game still be so trashy with such a big following  Surely funding and support are not issues  I think priorities are the problem There is more focus on generating revenue than on delivering a game that works Pathetic Do not buy this,negative
It s a really good game Recomand,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game with poor optimization and tons of cheaters Most ridiculoursly Bluehole did not put even a penny into the purchasing new servers its freaking unreliable thinking on give up this game and wait for other game with this type of generic,negative

I played this game for 14hrs and now I cant play it The game can not run every time I try it said can not conect to sever because the sever is too busy or can not initilize steam    My internet conection has no trouble I play overwatch everyday But each time I try to play pubg I can not conect to sever I want my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing refund  ,negative

If you looking for a game which fill with hackers look no further this is the perfect game,negative
Things that you need to fix and everyone else know   Random lot its too LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing random  Why cant I find an scope in Hacienda but I find an x8 in a house in the middle of the dessert   Squad mode should have less players  and perhaps an smaller section of the map  Playing solo vs 100 its ok because most of the players die in the first 2 3 minutes but playing Squad against 100 means that the most common cities will have up to  30 players in the same place all lagging  More maps,positive
game always lags people cheat and community is toxic,negative
Very fun game with friends in my opinion when your alone though it can be boring I enjoy this game and a lot of stuff about it I recomend this to people who are looking to have a fun battle royale experience with your friends,positive
This game is unbelievably infested with hackers and cheaters I would  estimate that every second or third game  sometimes 10 in a row I die to a blatant hacker   On the flip side the hackers and cheaters are dumb really dumb With good squad work you can take them out,negative

This game sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  You are just not able to pick the freaking map that you want to play I still dodge it but i cant get the option of choice that is ridicilous Every new update they LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up the game more and more look at the official twitter Its just a list of confirmations about the issues They fix one and get 3 more 7 days in a row or even more since the last anti cheat update came out my game just freezes on the loading screen like 3 5 matches out of ten and the only way to reconnect or close the damn game is to reboot the PC No matter what specs you have got you may face this problem And they cannot fix it THE GAME OF THE YEAR cant LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing deal with loading screen freeze The optimization still isnt completed After how long time  And the game is officially released The only thing they do good is skin collection If you truly hate yourself more than anything else on the entire earth then buy this game,negative
This game is beyond boring the maps are too big so games last too long The movement feels like LOVE LOVE LOVE  and they now charge you to open crates making earning the in game points useless Play Fortnite instead of this,negative
Posted  May 26  1 19amPUBG slowly became one of my most played games on Steam When the game first launched it rocked my world I had never played a battle royale game before this and the prospect of being the 1 player out of 100 was almost addicting I had a lot of fun and there were a lot of hilarious moments among friends but overall this game has been very disappointingWhen the game launched I readily accepted the clunky controls the terrible gun play and the frequent crashes After all it was an early access title A little over a year and a full release later I have come to realize that the terrible base mechanics of the game are here to stay Compared to any other shooter PUBG is downright awfulWhen it comes to gun play I honestly can t think of a worse game When I play a game like CS GO or really any other FPS I know exactly how my chosen weapon will perform If a player is far away I know where I need to aim to hit them If a player is moving I know how far I need to lead Not so with PUBG It seems that the requirements for hitting a target change with every round I m not sure if this has something to do with the server tick rate or the influx of Chinese players raising the ping but it is one of the most frustrating aspects of the gameAs for the controls they are extremely loose and floaty It feels almost as if you are piloting a boat instead of controlling a human being There is a noticeable delay between pressing a directional key and your character actually moving This presents a pretty big issue in a game that relies on quick response times to survive Another thing that I ve noticed is that it is almost impossible to pick up items at the start of a match If you are hoping to grab an item off of the floor in a timely manner you will have to spam the F key repeatedly in order to do soThis brings me to my last point which is how the game itself performs For a game that has supposedly been fully released it sure does crash a lot I would say that 1 out of every 3 games has some sort of issue that requires a complete restart and even then you are not guaranteed to make it back into the match Sometimes my friends are left out of a match entirely even though we all started matchmaking together Sometimes you don t load into the game until the plane has hit its last destination and pushed you out into the air Other times the game crashes with seemingly no explanation Please don t take it lightly when I say that this game is very poorly optimized I have a GTX 970 16 GB RAM and a 4790k i7 and I struggle to run this game without complications Overall this game is fun for about 100 hours and it is only fun if you don t mind putting up with a seemingly endless amount of garbage After that your interest will slowly diminish until you don t even feel like trying I absolutely do not recommend this game at it s current price The only way that this game would be worth anything would be if it were on sale for 15 or less,negative
STEVEN HAWKING RUNS BETTER THEN THIS GAME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DOG DROPPINGS1,negative
Bluehole has squandered the potential of this game to create microtransactions rather than work on improving this game  to a playable full release state  Although they claim this game is no longer in early access it does not play like a polished full release title  I ve played over 800 hours  but my play time over the last few months has not been consistent   There are too many community requests that have been neglected Is it too much to ask to be able to mute a single team mate instead of a full channel    We still do not have a test range to experiment with weapons and bullet drop Vaulting does not currently work in the manner that was originally promised  Bluehole claimed that they reason behind delays to implement vaulting  was due to implementation of a dynamic vaulting system  The current vaulting system is not what was promised by Brendan Greene  Bluehole   To top it all off we are now unable to trade items between players   I often traded duplicate items with between friends   The contents of the new Aviator crate are UNTRADEABLE AND NOT SALEABLE ON STEAM  I can t recommend any alternatives in this genre but a AAA Battle Royale will become available eventually  I d save your money until that day comes,negative
The game isn t bad but having it installed you have to download a 26MB patch every single day Is that really the best way to deal with cheaters  Anoying AF,negative
i have been playing thisz game for the last couple of weeks  and just finally got my first win i got banned i got two kills in the game and was carried the rest of the way by my group of friends today when i logged on i see that i am banned for cheating and hacking so please tell me how im cheating when im easily the worst one in my group and only have one win after almost 20 hours on the game,negative

RNG based game When there s no one around you ll find guns in the first room you enterWhen there s people around you ll get a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pistol or nothing at all When you manage to be the first one to land your computer s too utter garbage to even process the game and you ll freeze for a good 5 seconds before you can even loot or freeze upon opening inventoryWhen you  think  you re the first one to land your parachute freezes up and it takes you a good 2 second before you can even cut it When you manage to cut your parachute the guy has already looted two rifles and is probably already shooting you as your character completes the stupid landing animation Or you take about 50  damage,negative

I mean its a decent game and all far from perfect personally I d like it if the game had better motorcycle physics countless times I ve had lots of great weapons and a bunch of kills but due to a tiny invisible bump in the road the bike decides to tip forward with no way of me slowing it down or stabilising it in any way this usually results in either an instant death or all of your health wiped small things like this may seem a little pointless to change but the fact that it can result with that game being lost because of it makes it quite a nuisance people usually switch as soon as possible from bike to car because even if it does flip which usually it does at least it doesnt ruin that match for you Bikes currently are a death wish and fixing the physics for them would be greatly appreciated other than that the games pretty addictive,positive
Good game A lot of fun but the cheaters took over the game Now it s impossible to finish a match without crossing someone with aim bots and tracking cheats Sad It has everything to be a good game,negative

After spending many more infuriating hours with this game I decided to edit my review Don t get me wrong it is most certainly still a negative review but I want to just reorgnize my take on how bad this game really is This is my only current option for Battle Royale at the moment I am not a fan of Fortnite as I don t want to have to worry about building while trying to survive H1z1 has lost its alure for a while now and there really is no feeling of wanting to go back to it So I play this The most fun thing about this game to me  Picking a spot parachuting in and looting Not the gunplay and combat and that is a very bad thing This is just me and how I feel about it I am sure not many others feel the same way who knows My experiences just in the last few weeks has been atrocious I will say I am not that great at this game but I know nonsense when I see it We all know the engine is crap so there s no need to go too far into that The mechanics and controls are just not smooth either Take Call of Duty I understand it is from a much larger studio but it s something as simple as the controls and CoD at least gets it right in that regard incredibly smooth and easy to use Not clunky and just overall stupid like PUBG Balancing They just can t seem to get it right One day a gun does this much damage the next it does that much damage A Kar98 is supposed to one shot through a level 1 helmet only or a shot to the faceneck So why is it oneshotting through level 2 chest armor  Who knows after watching the replay over and over it was the chest not the neck and even if the replay was off it was still very low to be some type of lag on the replays part to actually be a neck shot The recoil seems to vary almost based on what damn time of day it is Audio is terrible The new muscle car makes me want to turn the game off As someone who has experienced it in real life I will say their rounds snapping by your head are pretty accurate but where I have the biggest problem is their movement sounds  Oh you heard a guy here    Nope he is way over thereand you didn t hear him move there  and he wasn t low crawling or shoeless either It s just so inconsistentWith how long it s been in development this game should be running a lot smoother and with all of the money they got from sales you would think they would be improving it Just throwing maps out doesn t add up to the near billion dollars the game made initiallyHackers continue to ravage the game to the point where tons of the reviews on here are about it and yet Bluehole still doesn t get it REGION LOCK Maybe I am blowing things out of proportion I don t know Bottom line is I think the reviews show many agree this game has turned into a dump and it is unfortunate Even if not for the same reasons I have stated it s in a bad placeMany may hate on CoD but I can at least trust them to get gunplay mechanics and smooth controls done right The overall game who knows how it will turnout but Blackops 4 is on my list because hopefully we get a decent to good BR that doesn t focus more on building than shooting,negative
Buy number less than 10 minutes just give me vac ban is really garbage cheat money,negative

In my opinion PUBG for PC is an incredibly fun game However it can be infuriating at times and I strongly recommend having a group of friends you can play this game with I got PUBG for Christmas on the Xbox one and as you may know the performance on xbox is subpar to say the least Now I have a relatively beefy PC and it runs on Ultra Graphics and it is much more enjoyable I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and it is superior to other Battle Royale games in my eyes,positive

In my opinion PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is the best shooter game till nowBe careful it will make you addicted,positive
I believe this game will soon be forgotten about if they dont remove their lootbox system so the incentive for cheaters to make a quick buck wont exist anymore I think customization and the ability to have unique clothing is great even let the players sell the rare clothes between eachotherWITHOUT BLUEHOLE TAKING MORE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES NONE OF THIS MONEY HAS GONE INTO THE RECENT DEVELOPEMENT OF THE GAME Their needs to be new maps every month WITHOUT copied structures pasted all over the mapcomplet with new guns vehicles and even enviromental dangers to beware of such as cold or radiationafter all this is supposed to be a survival game at its core Personally I think the game is better off without hunger or thirst mechanics so its great they havent made that mistake yet I think what Im trying to say is USE YOUR MONEY TO PUSH THE GAME INTO A REAL EXPERIENCE OR CREATE A PUBG2 WITH A BETTER DEVELOPMENT TEAM Like star citizen is taking some time too but you can see the work they are trying to do and PUBG has 1 major update from last year that seems like a ENORMOUS mistake and even though Bluehole has to know people are starting to look at their game as if it is maybe the biggest joke middle finger to every single player in the gaming community they seem as if they have intentions to give us what we really want to play A TRUE BATTLE ROYAL PUBG MAY NEVER BE,negative

The developers are too worried about making money on crates and selling copies than worrying about hackers There are times where the game is fun but more times than not you encounter an enemy with wall hacks and aimbots  you can even see in the replay For example my entire squad was shot in the head from 500 600m while driving in a truck  by a guy with a M16 and no attachments Things like this ruin the game and it seems the developers don t care the hackers run free,positive
i want  money for all the time i spent playing this game cant win a single game since the cheating epidemic no to mention the horrible hit reg and stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE  replay system witch never works properly this game has been out for so long the FPS numbers are sad i get higher FPS on GTA V online with higher settings for crying out loud this game is a joke un LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing playable bluehoe with over 360000000 in you hands how about you fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game you really let the money go to your head didnt you   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you bluehoe and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this gamesincerely me,negative

I would reccomend this game to anyone that likes tension high anxiety and fast reaction gaming Great game tight controls and a user interface worth learning in a game where you fight againts 70 100 people in a huge and i do mean HUGE map of desert hills and a new map coming in march  With guns splayed across said maps to kill each other withRemember it is a good thing to have at least a friend or two with you againts the unweildly people of the wilds See you on the battle grounds RegardsInsaneMIND103,positive
its part of the game but its way too luck based i can never pick up ARs if i go to small towns and i can never pick up a gun if i go to big towns just end up dying what can they do about this  nothing but seriously pisses me off when i die helplessly within 10 seconds of the game starting and i have to wait another 5 minutes for the game fill up wait 60 seconds wait for the plane and just dive down,negative

To Much Cheating in this game and the Company isnt doing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about it it used to be fun and it is addictive but i rather just play CCS then this for now until they fix and get rid of the Hackers and cheatersi get shot with the new sniper rifle AWP  he was in the house in the bedroom i was outside in my car and he shot me from the wall of the bedroom and killed meAnother is there not even aiming close to my body or head instead there about a car length of the game and they kill me headshot i was watching the death cam and the person wasnt even aiming at  me he was aiming some grass and got me headshot what kind of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t is that and thats Several of people i have caught on video doing that not even close to aiming at the body instead they aim some were else and there able to kill me It has become to stupid this game now  that i careless and rather just stick with my regular games cause this Company is not going to improve or get better i rather have my Refund on my Game then continue playing this POS,negative

Constant rubber banding car flipping client basedServer lag due to no region lock M4A1 is overpowered melee weapons are essentially useless you can lose to somebody hiding the entire game clothes are your only reward for being good at the game 1010 and game of the decade,positive
Server updates during prime time often usually takes 3 or more hours 8pm 11pm EST  There s no warning you just finish a game and get the  Cannot connect to server  message  Game struggles heavily with bugs and cheaters  They removed cool aspects like weather and have added a new desert map which is forced upon everyone and most people seem to hate it myself includedIf you die early on and your teamates are pretty loaded you might expect to wait 30 minutes or more while they continue  It s also encouraged to kill them since it adds to your points downing them doesn t who doesn t want more points Thumbs down because of the update times if nothing else,negative
PUBG is a very entertaining shooter For me it meant a revival of the genre What I like the most about this game is the realism  at least compared to other shooters  bullet damage is high and aiming is complex   i still suck while shooting through a scope  expect a slow learning curve There is strategy in the way you approach an enemy you can t simply rush to them and spray and pray for the kill every movement must be made with strategy  at least if you want to get to the final stages of the game Furthermore the survival mechanic adds a lot of replayability to the game there is something so addictive about dropping from a parachute looting for whatever weapon is available andsurviving Getting the sweet chicken dinner is very rewarding in such a game On the downside there are some games where you ll die within the first 20 seconds of the game Also and this is what bothers me the most are cheaters Sadly there are still ots of ways to cheat the game resulting in frustrating deaths where a player jsut shoots you blindly through a wall Nonetheless I think it is a game worth buying I have a lot of fun with it,positive
This game is so e sports ready even the smokes arent rendered correctly at some distanceSo what should the developing team do Correct release a shi  y console version and a mobile game,negative

The quality of the game has not improved If you are thinking about buying the game dont Major fps drop hit reg works about 34th the time and the player sync is absolutly horrible Bought the game pre launch because it had such potential  still does but the fact remains that the game is far from a complete and fully put together game,negative

Well this game was fun to play with friend and I have played a lot But then I was banned despite having no programs that tamper with the game or any modshacks No clear explanation for what caused it Would be nice to at least tell my friends what happened so it doesn t happen to them I would like to thank the developers for letting me play the game this long and then banning me for whatever reason On to fortnite I guess ,negative
Isn t it fun to get sprayed down by a guy with an AKM from around 300 meters away without any visible recoil  Funny thing is bluehole doesn t give a damn and here s the reason why 1 They locate a popular hack and generate a usage statistic for this specific hack2 They wait until the hack usage spike falls and equalizes  up to this point no one was banned3 Now they ll ban everyone who was using that hack4 Every cheater will now require a new account  this generates a lot of game sales for them or in other words money5 After generating a lot of game sales by banning those hackers they ll just wait for the next big hacking tool to emerge6 Now they ll repeat this very processThere s no good intension behind this instead of generating more money If you really wanted to make a game free of cheating you could include machine learning algorithms and code with some very basic multiplayer coding guidelines  ex not accepting any data from the client that has nothing to do with required movement or aim position commands like player healthFunny thing is this happens with any multiplayer shooter More cheaters  more banned players  more sold games  more money for the developersIts as simple as this and their greed disgusts me,negative
Honestly most fun Ive had playing in years just watching people rage quit  rage uninstall rage about anything helps me trim my friends list of people who like to game for fun Remember kids YOU ARENT Getting paid to play games are for fun and if you are a streamer and get paid to play games and dont like this one  Simple play another game If you do t like the next one you play time to look in the mirror and consider therapy or you just suck at gaming 1010 better than goat sim Would play again,positive

PUBG si very nice gameFor me this game gets 810 pointsWhy  810 because        Hasnt got a good optimization and Quite often there is little action in the game because the maps are too big                                             ,positive

Okehh,positive
Less emphasis on crates and more on gameplay next time yeh  Also the fact that the zone takes 5 seconds to kill you and you dont even have time to res a teamate whos 3 meters out of the second last zone is just stupid You should think more about adding a gradual damage increase to the zone as it shrinks rather than a sudden burst of more than triple the damage and speed the moment a zone reaches a certain sizeIn the late stages of the game the zone timer is also too short to support the damage it puts out If you happen to have a bad zone spawn and dont literally start running the moment the zone changes it will catch and kill you Which is ridiculous because in the later stages there are so many enemies crammed together that being forced to rush to the zone so quick is practically an instant death anywayA couple other things that are long over due are 1 The ability to toggle which maps you want to play As much as you think everyone likes your new map its not true2 A local training map By this I mean being able to launch a single player match locally that consist of nothing but a shooting range with every gun available and infinite ammo as well as a few targets at varying distancesCurrently its not impossible but its pretty difficult and annoying to enter a game find a gun shoot a wall and waste all your bullets while trying to adjust your mouse settings to be optimal for controlling bullet spray A target range type map with all the guns would be perfectAnyway as it is I do still play the game but it feels like the things that are important for the game to thrive are being neglected so as such I cant recommend it currently,negative
Since 28022018 Lot s of players are not able to play the game Because Game version 3613 does not support the game and asking us to update it to 3614   I can t which means other players can t too Overall I have paid reasonable amount of money but I can t play the game it s been nearly 24 hours and problem is still not fixed Not happy at all and this shows that PUBG Team is not doing their best to solve this at all You are the creators shouldn t take that long This is my opinion correct me if I am wrong Thanks to everyone for reading,negative
very good game realistic Real guns close enough physics logical It would be great if they can add AI for practice for new players or a zombie mode where everyone can compete together Game has some performance issues but its getting better 60FPS no problem with any decent computer This game is worth every penny so go buy em This is definately the best game PUBG fortnite,positive
servers are bad got good loots and them bam server crashes and then i gotta start a new game,negative
Pubg is an amazing and fun fpp and tpp game Prehaps one off  the best I have expirenced I highly recommend this game to others to buy since it can be a competive game and then a game for fun also I have over 100 hours of gameplay and still is growing Pubg can also be played  in many differnt ways and tatics which makes the game more fun,positive

Since the new patch  220218 pubg is completly unplayeable this massive stuttering messes up every round This so called Major server changes are like a downgrade even bevore version 10 very sad since it was running relativly fine for a few weaks Gonna try chaning some starting options maybe anyone finds a solution for this But if its not fixed i whould not recommend buying this game at everyone whining about how many chinese players there are   just play fpp chinese seem to avoid it since i rearly encounter any of them playing on EU to be honest But yes a region lock china and maybe russia whould still be recommendeable,negative
If this was a  star rewiew  i would give 35 Buggy test servers have been broken since Sanhok came Most cases need keys that cost money Get s boring eventually and very repeative The other negative reviews are mostly correct Only good is many guns cars that have been mostly fixed and big maps So do not buy if you don t want to waste money on a game that you want to play for some weeks Oh yeah and hackers and chinese people ruin the game too Team killing is a thing too,negative

 DISCLAMER  I DO NOT PREFER OR DISLIKE FORTNITE Firstly i really enjoy playing PUBG as the concept is great and a real challange even better with friends this game alllows for tactical and planned gameplay or run and gun This is great as due to the randomness of the game anybody can get that elusive chicken dinner BUTA    OPTIMISATION  the game is afully optimised although it has got better you still need a beefy pc to run for me this was no issue as i knew the game was in early acess so it would get better But now its out in this state it is unaccetabe B    XBOX  make the game run on pc first please I paid for the pc version do bee developed not the xbox versionC    THE GAME LOOKS TRASH  Boxy landscapes and trash textures and buildings out of minecraft D    SKINS  fix your game first please or atleast make cool ones not just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing orangeE   CROSSPLATFORM  simply cannot compete with fortnite s XboxPs4mobilePc cross play To conclude while PUBG  from a distance is better than fortnite the rate at which the game is updated and fixed cannot compete with that of Epic games However with a better focus from Bluehole and regular meaningfull updates the game can still thrive,negative
lots of cheaters im hoping they can fix this issues,negative

Great game in which you can have alot of funMy criticism isnt with the game itself its purely about the developersgame is still buggy and servers are a jokeIts no longer early access and a game in this state to be  released  is quite the jokeAs of right now If you havnt gotten this game yetwaitSee if Bluehole manages to find their thumb considering its so far up their LOVE LOVE LOVE  they might need a mapIfwhen they doBuy it,negative

I wish I could recommend this game I have had a lot of fun with it but as I type I m AGAIN unable to log in an play because the game is down  They have basically limitless money between the game sales and the keys they sell for boxes etc so how is it that the game still has issues just running   On top of this the game is seriously over hyped  Sure it s great and it launched the battle royale craze but more so because it was the right game at the right time  As I said it is fun I have played a lot and I have 3 solo wins  so I m not just being salty here but I feel like most other producers could do it betterAnother issue I have is no real reward for playing  I mean why don t I get anything when I win   Sure it s satisfying when I won my first solo match I was beside myself but shouldn t I at least get a cosmetic to wear in game or something   I can grind for crates which have a like a 001  chance of dropping the really cool items but that is not fun either  I welcome all other publishers to copy PUBG and make it better,negative

PUBG is an extreamly fun and extreamly addicting game you will love every second of it I highly reccommed this game to anyone who likes H1Z1 or Fortnite 30 is a miniscule price for the amount of enjoyment you will recive I have pumped 500 hours into it and I am still in love with every round I play Take it from me I ve playing PC games since I was 6 and PUBG is definitely my all time favorite game and I bet it will become yours too,positive

Technically speaking this game is STILL a dumpster fire I actually enjoy the gameplay itself well enough when I m not being screwed by terrible hit registration or the abundance of hackers that plague the servers but that doesn t change the fact that this game is still FULL of bugs and glitches it s STILL the only game my high end PC has trouble runningcrashes with and I get the feeling these issues aren t really going anywhere all this time and millions in profits for the developer laterIf you don t have a crazy good computer I d really recommend just getting Fortnite It s obviously a much different experience and a lot of PUBG purists sneer at that game but it s fun in its own way and it won t make your computer suffer to run it As is I really can t recommend spending money on this if only because it s further encouraging the people who made it that their broken unfinished product is worth the money,negative

Recent optimisation has made this game so much better on top of being an already good battle royaleHigher frame rates gave enabled people with less powerful computers to play against those who do regardless of setupAlthough the devs still need to work on hitboxes and desync game shows no sign of dropping below competitors such as fortniteI didnt however feel they needed to implement the buying of keys which is present in games such as H1Z1 and CS GO Does ruin the vibe of being a game and more of being an obvious money catch,positive
A great concept for a game but the delivery of it by this developer team has been very poor for over a year now There is no communication No roadmap to fix known issues or introduce new ingame items The solution to the hacking problem is simple and i cant believe it hasnt been implemented You NEED to introduce Verified account match making These hackers are ruining the game You can put in a region lock You can put in a ping lock on but really it won t work The only solution to this is for long term account holders to play against eachother and the hackers and smurfs battle it out against eachother Also if someone is reported for hacking and proven to be a hacker just remove their name from the leaderboard it s such a simple concept and easy to implement Devs need to pick up their game LITTERALLYOther than that the graphics maps game play are all okay Just FIX THE HACKING ISSUE PLEASE,negative

This game is by far the worst game I have ever played yet it keeps me coming back for more It s like an alcoholic abusive boyfriend It cheats on you it beats you up but you still love it unfortunately The amount of hackers in this game is out of control The bugs and glitches in this game are out of control The lack of communication the people at  blueballs  is ridiculous Overall I m sick and tired of playing this gameI think the main reason I keep coming back to it is because it hadhas the potential to become a fantastic game however the amount of problems this game is plagued with will be its downfall I hope this game becomes better but at this point I don t see this abusive boyfriend getting any better than it already is Good luck  blueballs  you re going to need it,negative
dsync dealing damage is like rolling dice roll a D6 1 4 you did no damage ragardless of seeing blood splatter sometimes gunfire makes no sound when in firefights cars skip around like it wasnt meant to be in the game Unreal engine cant handle this kind of game Developer made millions and cant finish the game  Adding replays just sealed the deal of proving the inconsistency in this game csgo match making has better hit registry than this game If you peak and immediatly run for cover you still take dmg from someone you saw 10 seconds ago,negative

Despite all the attention this game got it was DOA from the startI tried to make it work to play it even enjoy it It was not able to do any of this Only working with a squad did the game become a bit more bareableThis game isn t sim neither it is arcade it s battle royale style or king of the hill style but had no substanceFlaws and faults of this game would fill the character limit of this review screen I would not no where to begin None get fixed as one is replaced by anotherThe asian influence of this game and it s availability acros the SEA is most of the reason it exploded like it did However the game and gameplay are not the reason It s the items for money system which in their world is a multi million dollar industryIf you removed the in game currency and ability of items being sold this game would die over nightSadly i cannot for any good reason recommend this game to anyone It hurts to even think about the how you may in maybe 1 out of 30 games you may get a good one an in that good one you may even finish and for what  200 more in game currencyPlaying online is such a weird and detached experience,negative

Hi guys i am songbaoXD a chinese PUBG player I am not a pro but this article it s just to make sure that everyone who wish to buy this game can know what PUBG is First i need to claim that if you use to play Fortnite then you can t say much and judge this product i know there are lot s of people saying that Fortnite is way better than PUBG in different ways either Graphics Weapons Maps and lot sort of things but i don t want to argue any more But just saying PUBG is a mature game for those gamers who extremely like battle royale games PUBG is really similar to H1Z1 if you use to play it then it s good for you although i never ever tried H1Z1 before because it s dead PUBG has two maps it s a 50  chance to get any of the map So you need to know every looting area in both maps such as military base or El Pozo first is the old map second one is in the new dessert map I prefer Old map for the  noobs  because it s easier to see those people hiding in the ground There are advantages in PUBG like 64 64 ultra big map and vehcles and sort different guns There are disadvangtages too for example there s a guy in chille suit right next too you but you just can t spott you and you got killed by him using a frying panThat s the end of it it s a extremly good game please add me if you want to play together Thank youHope you enjoy it,positive

Sometime between beta and now they added special crates that you can purchase with points  obtained through play in addition to the normal crates on offer They do not indicate that these special crates require physical cash money to open If you happen to buy one of these crates tough LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  thanks for wasting several hours of playtimeDisgusting business practice even worse than you see in mobile garbage At least they re usually upfront about what is held behind a paywallThe game is otherwise pretty good and this is the only instance of real true money grubbing I ve seen but using deception like this is intolerable,negative

There are known cheaters still in the Leaderboard  with over 1000 gamesDue to the variarety of hacks you never know if your enemy cheated or notOver 30 million copies sold and very simple but highly useful improvements are missing since months eg   map select   keep zoomlevel of scope   keep selected game mode   remove the step like sound in the background noiseAlso simple minor bugfixes are missing since months for example the really fked up text in the lobby Such bugs set the bar of expectation really low,negative

Sooner or later you will succumb to the inner feeling that you need to stop playing this gameLargely down to two things 1 The inconsistency of performance and how flippantly they seem to break the game and fix the game right now actually it seems in a good place drag looting feels the best it ever has and the game seems to be running smooth but there is always the inevitable feeling that the next patch will break the gameIf the the impact of this was minute it wouldn t be so bad but when the game fails to load in half the time or a lag spike at the most inopportune moment it becomes intolerable2 The loot Honestly You can sometimes loot half of a main town and come away with nothing The 5050 battles you might have with someone that lands at the same building as you fair enough it adds to the tension of the game and is a fundamental part of the Battle Royale Genre but looting 5 6 sizeable buildings and having a crossbow and shotgun at your disposal is frankly unacceptableSure   this is randomised but jeez   just increase the drop rates of loot I never heard once anyone complaint that there is too much loot in the game or that the game is being overly favourable towards you it is inconsistent beyond believe and unforgiving in doing soI am recommending the game because as frustrating the game has become for me to the point where I cannot wait for a decent developer to come along and give us the Battle Royale game we want I put over 500 hours into this game and it gave me some of the most memorable gaming moments that I can think of It is a fantastic game to play with friends very engaging and allows for each game to approached dynamicallyBut be warned as much as I wanted to love this game and play it for years to comeYou will succumb to that feeling,positive

this game is so huge disappointment after refunding it s predecessor i gave this one chance because a lot better graphics in comparison but game performs poor in relatively new computer  3 4 years old and multiplayer is laggy foes sees your character about 500 1000 ms later so you end up being shot behind cover very bugged vehicles you get killed randomly the staff is not transparent about their future plans and they exuse their incompetence with cheaters bringing up fake numbers like million banned accounts which is ridiculous there is not even so many players and instead of solving problems they started selling skins,negative

TPP mode  most of the time you ll face cheaters FPP mode  the only mode with less cheaters but still there are foes playing with no recoil macros who suck at aiming so they had to use a macroserver performance is good if you have low ping like lower than 50 60 ms Else you ll notice that enemy will kill you before you kill him even you are the one started shooting I don t know what kind of prediction they wrote in this game but it isn t looking good in practice Desync in this game still exists for example enemy will shoot you while you peek but at client screen you are behind the wall and there it goes you get knocked out while you are behind the wall I know servers are better than old times now but still not good enough Oh and shotguns which most of the time will do half the hp damage of enemy I don t know what kind of rng is inserted to shotguns you ll notice that if you are not lucky enough your enemy will one shot you with same shotgun you didn t knock out him with one shot Looting balance  in previous patches said to be balanced looting but yeah for sure my most balanced was 6 p1911 pistols in the same 2  story house I d honestly say loot is terribly rngCar mechanics  for now most vehicles have high rate of rolling before the 10 update except 3 seat bike every vehicle was good now also in new map vehicles are crap rolling easily cuz there are lots of roughness you have to drive through mountains cuz roads are not safe to drive your car will be blown away by campersgood thing about this game is it is still fun despite all those negative things but Still I don t wanna recommend this game  developpers shall listen to ideas of popular streamers on twitch and youtube about how to make this game better Else when another company releases a better BR game than pubg this game will be history,negative

it isn t worth the moneyat the begging it s seems like an awesome game but after a while you ll start to get bored from the game and barely playing and if you ll find your self playing the game it will be 1 or 2 matchesin short the game will give some great first hours of experience but be Aware that you may wont stand the game for long,negative

After experiencing so much time with PUBGfinallyI really got fed up with everything of THIS GAMEIn the first timeI played it with my roommates and I really had fun because we knew nothing about this gameWe had our own fun as rookies which I really cherishAt that time PUBG I thought was a pretty good gameBUTwhen you want to play a game from entertainment to competitionI gradually found out it was not so satisfactoryBUGsPLUGsstuttersEvery time I turned it on with emotion of KILLING EVERYONEAlwaysI was full of disapointment to turn it down with emotion of IT S A WASTING OF TIMENowI can t figure it out that the people fighting with were whether normal people or GODSNowI admit itI m a rookie forever in this gameActuallyTHANK YOU for letting me have fun in this game though I didn t have much good game experienceI ll uninstall it and return to League of Legend where I still had rank of PlatinumFinallywish you produce better game and have better performance,positive
rather addicting doesnt matter if the match is 30 seconds or 20 min,positive
I don t understand why this game has mixed reviews at this timeThis is literally one of my favorite games of all timeIt is challenging competitive and action packed Yeah it can be a walking simulator at times but if you land in the middle of the map you will mostly avoid that So the game really plays out like you want it to  slow or fast paced based on where you initially choose to landI played this game during EA and loved it After it offically released they brought a whole new level of polish to the game which actually managed to impress me quite a bit It still isn t perfect but I really have no complaints There is the occasional bug though crashes seem to get more and more sparse My friends and I aren t crazy about the bomb zone but primarily because it s super loud when the bombs start droppingAnyways this game is incredibly fun Don t listen to the negative reviews I have played this game a pretty fair amount and have only once encountered someone that I was absolutely positive was cheating One night I accidentally played on Chinese servers for a couple hours because I didn t realize I had switched regions and didn t encounter any cheaters Most of the times I feel my deaths are legitimate and just a matter of other players having better positioning accuracy etc,positive

Brutal game   ,positive
First off this game would be great if it weren t for the total incompetence and lack of vision of the developers There is very little to get you acclimated and the UXUI is on the level of snapchat in its usability Guns and attachments are a total mystery with no way to test any of them outside of a live game which if you re lucky enough to find one would give away your position and get you killed immediately if you attempted to target practice In that vein the beginning of the game can be an exercise in not throwing your computer as the game struggles to load under the weight of what I can only assume is a microwave powering the servers The mad dash to pick up items as they lag into your inventory while being punch only adds to this exerciseSecondly in a game of 100 people with what seems like little to no way to stop cheating the game loses any chance it could have been to be fun With 100 people in the game there is a 100  chance you will encounter a cheater and you will more often than not loseFinally the ability to join different servers around the world seems reasonable until you realize that means playing with people who cannot speak or understand you in a game that requires teamworkAll this being said there is some enjoyment to be had but at the price point I wouldn t recommend this game,negative

Where do i start i love this game very much it is a fun game to play with your friends but i was playing with my friends 3 days ago i get off wake up the next morning and im banned i have had this account for 3 years and have played pubg for 133 hours and i have played counter strike for 63 hours and never have been banned because i never have cheated i would recommend to people who want a false vac ban on there account trying to reappel the decision through there ticket systme will be greated with them saying  please understand that a restriction is placed because we have determined that there was a violation of our terms and services  i have never hacked because i play on squads with my friends and we always lose this is one of the best gems from PUBG Support   We have also implemented a 24 hour investigation period to ensure that there are no false bans Therefore we do not accept any requests for rechecking account restrictions  If your 24 hour investigation fails and i am falsly banned then i should not be guilty until proven inncocent This is why valve should not give bans to developers because they abuse it it just makes me angery when the support responds and basically says well we think you cheated so you cheated I would just like to know why i was vac bannned i never cheated i don t even care about pubg anymore i just want clear the slander that now has clouded my name because of this dumb game its not even the game its the developers that falsely banned me And thats why i don t like this game because it tarnished my reputation,negative

Don t expect to run this game unless you own a 2400 gaming system designed for games and even then the game will struggle to run 60FPS at high resolution If you own anything less than that expect your screen to freeze every 2 seconds at minimum resolution and very low graphics which are the 5thworst available As well as this the gameplay is disappointing and lacks and design creativity The development team have repeatedly failed to optomize the game well even through the long awaited launch,negative

PUBG is a great game I ve played countless hours solo and with friends loving my life and enjoying it Not taking the game too seriouslyHowever with the current amount of cheaters   proven time and time again since the introduction of the Death Cam I can no longer enjoy this gameI m in the top 20 players 50  of the time the top 10 players 40  of the time and the top 5 players 10  of the timeI go into almost all games now knowing I will be killed by a cheater   the most commong ones are auto locking onto players Finding players with no line of sight  No tracking I ve literally been killed whilst I was typing a text message hidden in the corner of nowhere and the guy hones in on me or a great no recoil cheatThe issue here isn t the game it s trust Whats the point of attempting to play when I know 70  of the time I ll die to a hacker I don t mind loosing in PUBG thats what makes it fun But going into a game knowing you ll loose to some teenage waste of space with hacks on ruins every single aspect of a battel royal gameStay away until the publisher sorts it out,negative

A fun and intense game of battle royale Gunplay is great and the game is not too buggy  at least for me Due to the nature of the play area getting smaller in different locations on the map and item spawns games are varried Fun to play with friends or by yourself all in the pursuit to get that sweet chicken dinner Lot s of fun to be had with this gameOnly downside is you have to put up with some hackers which can make some angry Just region lock the game or come up with a better way to pair people up The ping based matchmaking sounds like a step in the right direction We ll see what happens in the future but for now it s a solid good,positive
When it first came out this game was pretty fun but some how they broke it so bad that the xbox version is more playableThe past three games I ve played the game froze as soon as i found a match and i know others where it freezes every other game Worst of all is how everyone has ARs with no kick and fire faster on single than on full auto,negative

If i were to write a review based on my first few weeks playing this game it would be a HUGE THUMBS UP However after 700 hours of gameplay and tons of chicken consumed I have to say please DO NOT BUY this game  It is truely tragic that a game this great has fallin so far At least 1 out of 5 games end by a headshot burst from an AR from hundreds of yards away because some people cant play by the rules Then once a month or so we get to read how PUBG Corp has come up with new anti cheat software and have banned X amount of acounts as a result Yet still the cheating continues Honestly PUBG when you dont get cheated is a blast and a half but its a true waiste of time and a huge disapointment when you spend upwards of 30 minutes playing a game just to get offed by a cheater Thank you for those who read my rant and please do yourself a favor and atleast wait for the game to be fixed before you buy,negative

Okay i dont do reviews but PUBG rates a real lashing This game simple in its idea and execution has the potential to be amaze balls That being said it is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor coded aim bot rampant piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with no change in sight They are losing players at a rate ive never seen before and i would urge those of you thinking of buying it to turn your backs on whoever owns the game now I hope you die a HORRIBLE death PUBG,negative

I m going to put forward an unpopular opinion in times of late PUBG is a great game with a concept that is unbeatable in current times Bearing in mind the  mostly neagive  recent reiews   PUBG is at the top of the stats list for most active players at one time 247     Surely this means they are doing something rightRecently the game has improved I hope that this fact is undisputed I d say the servers have improved the UI is lookin  good and the addition of new maps weapons skins is moving the franchise in the right direction New metas are forming forcing players to adopt different play styles than before Progress is being made unfortunately it s never fast as you d like it Keep having fun by dropping in hot at the school or looting up for the win I suspect soon they ll win a few of these nay sayers back with something to their liking,positive
The game is a buggy piece of S  t that kills you  for stupid reasons shooting sucks the game keeps you desyncd non stop  so even if you  dodge  bullets 80  of the time the game registers your movements too slow  you still die objects dont spawn on the map early game you depend on luck too freaking much oftenly when you get out of the water you just get instakilled or getting 9999k dmg from a pistol round LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   nothing else to say,negative

Well I m currently at over 500 hours If someone was to ask me if the game was worth buying I would say  MmmmMaybe When it isn t An obvious hackerA graphical problem   such as grass not rendering way far out Hiding in the grass near the end  Not if someone is far enough away from you Just you in a wide open field This can also be a good thing depending on which person you are in this situation Also some things take a bit to render and that shouldn t be happening on my system The most recent update has really done optimization wondersA questionable kill cam  which rarely seems to display things how it shouldThe hitboxping lag where you are surely behind cover but still get shotIt s a very rewarding game I ve had it for a long time now but did not play any similar games to it before With each update does come some significant changes Some of the changes seem to take a long time but they do happenSo   this can be a great game with a squad and lots of fun can be had A lot of frustration can be had as well I wouldn t say it s a  you have to play this  but it can be fun Spend wisely edit  After seeing the newest news about updates and what was addressed and what wasn t addressed I would not suggest buying the game for now Fix what s already with the game don t keep adding to it,negative

Graphics  910Compared to other battle royale games PUBG has great graphics Realistic and easy on eyesMaps  610Only 2 maps options Both maps have few bugs when it comes to vehicles or buildingsGameplay  610If you don t know how a 4x scope or 8x scope works in real life Then you are doomed in the game Crosshair means nothing You have to fire while keeping in mind the distance between you and target If the target is moving you can t just put your cross hair on the target and shoot it won t hit Gets frustrating after few gamesHackers  1010This game is infested with hackers using wallhacks and aimbots I have played on every single server and its all the sameOverall rating  510Needs major fixing I used to enjoy this game but more I play more I hate it,negative
Game is trash Runs like trash looks like trash plays like trash Trash experience Devs made all their money off the initial launch and only seek to make more via crates The game is broken has been broken and will remain broken until the majority jumps ship Hackingcheating abounds Not even worth investing free time 010 Deleted and will never re install,negative
its pretty fun and enjoyable,positive
Riddled with hackers and the devs admit 98  of them are from china yet they dont region the game The only reason they dont is after hte ban they get a extra sale anyone who says ea and money grabers and likes how the devs of this game aproach sales is a hipocrite great idea but like all blue hole games will never be propperly finished and supported Desink issues unconistant with damage vehicles that randomly hit invisible walls and flip from touching a pebble after this many updates the  game is still in beta yet they change weapons stats and further ruin the game but wont optimise and and fix consitancy,negative

1110 game  Random bugs but nothing too game breaking for the most part  other than sometimes not loading in that is in fact gamebreaking  Great gun play  Has the potential to be amazing both in squad and solo  Until another decent BR game comes out  not fortshite this will continue going strong Saying this blueholes total lack of interest in implementing something resembling a working anti cheat will be its downfall  Once you start getting to the  higher    s you will almost certainly notice the hacking issue and no im not 100  blaming China  Totally worth the money itll pass a lot of time and be fun just dont be shocked when you  not if when get killed by a hacker using an AK on auto with no scope from 800m away  one of many examples Who knows  Maybe one day they ll actually deal with the cheaters and not rely on merely banning their PUBG account knowing fine well they ll just spend the money on Steam for another copy giving a continuous supply of revenue One can hopeIf bluehole would stop porting PUBG to everything else and sort out the platform that made them that d be swell but hey theres still money to be made on the wii yet Dont worry the next big BR will come along at some point and bluehole will slip back under the radar where it belongs,positive

I do not strongly recommend this game Very good game for you and your friends but full of bugs Technicians must support it otherwise it will cease to be interested in playing It can receive many corrections and improvements,positive
Currently it harder to encounter a player without using cheats than a player that play with cheats The game is full of players with cheats because cheats helps you to win and the wins gives you prophit This enviroment was created from developers not by mistake They do ban some cheaters just to make the cheaters buy the game again so both sides have a prophit The game is fun but all that fun is ruined,negative
Pros   The concept of the game is great and the gunplay is fantastic  That s it close combat is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  thoughCons   Desynclag issues at the start of the match STILL  VERY low tick rate servers for the start of the match  Good luck shooting someone at the start of the game because they teleport back and forth  Players with higher ping have peeker s advantage  RNG at the start of the game is too much with the lack of guns and armor if RNG is against you  RNG red circle  RNG blue circle  RNG availability of vehicles  RNG of crate drops  RNG of plane path  Hackers everwhere  ESP hackers  Aimbot hackers  Wall hacks hackers  Lack of foliage hackers  Recoil macro exploiters  RNG of getting needed 4x and 8x scopes  RNG of finding a rifle and sniper  China EU Aussie Russians South Americans and Middle eastern players are about 80  of the players playing on NA servers  They like to have the high ping advantage  D reportable offense of exploiting the game being a dumbass client side shooter  I haven t even mentioned all the game breaking bugs,negative

An awful game with an exciting concept I played during  early access  and while there were a lot of bugs desync and overall issues then patches and hotfixes were frequent and it looked like the game was headed the right way Ever since the official release of 10 though everything has turned to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Updates stopped desync has gotten a lot worse more and more bugs appear and more and more hackers as well It s gotten painfully hard to enjoy playing anymore and today I m uninstalling until updates and fixes are being doneHackers are present in probably every game whether you notice them or not Some are blatant like headshotting half the server from across the map others like no recoil scripts you might not even realize or at least can t be certain cause of the buggy and unreliable replaydeath cam systemBy latest info that I could find PUBG has sold over 30 million copies A few weeks ago there was a post that said there had been one million accoutns banned for cheating ONE MILLION If we say that all of those 30 million copies are active players which of course they re not then on average that is 3 cheaters per game Every lobby you join hoping for a fair and fun game there are 3 cheaters on average and that is just being modestBut cheaters aren t even the biggest issue for me what s even more annoying is the ridiculous amount of bugs that are simply not being addressed Let me list some of them on top of my head   Bullets ignoring armor  Cars exploding from touching something at 1kmph  Bikes flipping from the smallest random bump on the road  Shots vanishing into thin air  Completely random damage on some weapons shotguns I blasted someone in the face from 1m   23 of his health not one shot another guy shoots me from across the yard from hipfire   one shot dead  Landing from your parachute you flip a coin whether or not you ll take damage  The air above the trees on Miramar is impenetrable   you see someone s full body and shoot but your bullets hit the air around the tree  Grass and other objects not being rendered from a big distance making people that seem in cover fully standing out  Grenades damage randomly getting negated by an object on a table  DESYNC My God the desync You see someone in the open you go in a building close the door go in another room and BAM you get shot by the guy two walls and a door away from you  Game freezes and connection issues ALL of my friends experience this at least once a day when joining a game where they hear sound but see just the PUBG logo on the screen and the game loads for them when the plane dumps the last people It s even worse for me because the game doesn t load at all for me and I have to close it from task manager start it again and reconnectAll of the above issues have been in the game for MONTHS and nothing has been done to fix or even address them Don t waste your time and nerves on this game,negative
Welcome to PUBG if you would like to pay for an anti cheat that is about as useful as an autistic kid on a submarine then this game is for you you unlucky son if a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  This game kicks off with a thrilling drop into a cluster off butt LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  useless equipment on the rare occasion you get a weapon congrats you may have gotten a single kill Now if you would also like the deluxe model it comes with a red zone that may on occasion blow you up inside of  safe areas  Also if you enjoy long walksdrive s to calm you down then get ready For about 5 minutes as long as the illusion lasts you can have some bliss but once thats over you will probably die to some random poorly generated rock that will get you caught in it and blow you up for no apparent reason Also if you are working with an average computer dont even bother attempting to run this thing its optimised about as well as your experience will go Now if you somehow make it past all this then prepare for the blue zone this mistress will creep up on you slowly bend you over and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you senseless as it will kill you faster then you are able to heal5 seconds so if you make it past the 20 minutes of the game without being shot but some hacking cuck then get ready for that also thsi blue zone tends to do everything in its power to place you in a spot to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you silly all in all the dopamine you get off a single game may be worth it but hey atleast the bikes are fun to ride,positive

Before 10 and the mass ban wave PUBG was unstable slithering with cheaters full of game breaking bugs and overall a game that you wanted to enjoy but simply couldn t After all the recent patches and improvments almost all of those problems are gone FPS can sometimes be a slight issue but that is expected for such a large map with millions of interactable objects being loaded at once For reference with a  nothing overclocked i5 6600k 16gb DDR4 and a 1060 6gb running Windows 8 I can cling on to 60fps without v sync but at times   especially in the first 5 10 minutes of the match   it can drop to around 30 for a few seconds every so often I can t complain though   it used to be a hell of a lot worse and it seems to be improving every patch so If played right it is a really enjoyable game with tons to do and so many opportunities to kill In your first few games you ll probably want to drop somewhere remote to gear up and then approach people once you are ready   bad idea You ll end up finding almost nothing and then you won t see anyone until the last 20 people The best way to learn to play this game is to throw yourself head first   literally Drop into the most populated spots  usually just the biggest areas on the map and get straight into it You ll get far fastYou have the ability to make the match what you want it to be just by dropping in a certain area and that s what makes this game stand out,positive
This game is aaawweesome  Go get it,positive
cushty game on my life,positive
Be warned  This game has a very high learning curve There is nothing to give you a tutorial or get you ready to play They don t have the courtesy to explain that you will die when outside the play area or even that you have to get there The gameplay is very confusingIf you are not already an experienced FPS player I would not recommend playing this game It is too frustrating to get started with,negative
Brings back memories of DayZ Vanilla but in a battle Royale scenario minus the weird Arma bugs Every game is different and has it s own challenges Got to say enjoying it so far if you like a challenge go for 1 Man Squads and see how far you get,positive
this game the best,positive
I m gonna get hate for this review but I could care less This isn t an  I suck so I m gonna complain to the devs to change the game  this is going to be constructive critcismI will say that this game is really overrated After the countless hours I ve played in DayZ and some DayZ Battle Royal this game just doesn t live up to it It s just not funMy time playing PUBG a good 10 matches in 4 hours was spent 5  actually in combat15  looting80  Running to try to get in the f cking circleThere are a few flaws with the game the biggest is it s lack of map diversityThe maps are too big Plain and simple In TPP people will often camp in a city and not even try to play actual Battle Royale and just camp for kills It s a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  experience when you re actually trying to play Battle Royale and some asshat in a building snipes you because he has no interest in trying to get to the circle probably due to microtransactions but that s a whole different problem FPP usually fixes this because you won t have people abusing TPP and I ve had much better action in FPP than in TPP but the problem is still thereAn easy fix is to use some of the gagillion dollars they make to make some smaller more action oriented maps not like CoD small but a good bit smaller than the current mapsDayZ was a much more balanced experience At times in PUBG I will literally go almost a whole match without any combat to the point where if I actually see a guy I ll have no interest in tactically trying to kill him and instead just bullrush him to find enjoyment and something to laugh atThis is not to say that PUBG is a bad game it s not It can be loads of fun All the weapons are pretty interesting all buildings are enterable and killing someone is very satisfying Though there can be improvements For example weapon sound distance can be improved Sometimes it s pretty difficult to figure out where you re being shot from and from how far and also detecting what weapon is shooting you The combat situations are very adrenaline pumping but they re short lived which is a huge dissapointment They don t last for more than a minute I think my longest was 45 seconds as compared to my longest in DayZ which was 5 minutes and the two situations were roughly similar in distance and terrain The game also lacks a drive for Lone Wolf play I d enjoy this game much more with friends to heighten the stakes of combat situations but playing Lone Wolf is just no fun in a game that s supposed to be about being a lone survivor Honestly the game is more fit for being a Wasteland type game where you just shove a bunch of players on a map give them vehicles big guns and objectives to get bigger guns to fight it outAll in all PUBG is a pretty fun game with just a lack of variety and wasn t thought out as well as it should have been There are some easy fixes that can be applied to the game to make it so much more fun and I m sure the devs are thinking about them but as of now it s just not that alluring of a game to enjoyWith some innovation this game can really take off to a new levelPros Excellent gun playWell optimized Satisfying actionAddictiveFun with FriendsVery nice visuals Keeps you on your toesCons Too much runningSparse actionShort lived actionDeathly boring at timesNot enough CQCLack of map diversity Can get boring very quickly,negative
The game is fun and all but They broke the game in the last patch now i can play for 2 minutes before full system freeze Worked perfectly fine before the patch and nothing else has changed with my PC They won t admit that it s their game that s broken when people complain online and there are no current fixes for it I have tried reinstalling the game updating every single driver  even the ones unrelated and reinstalled my OS Nothing works Don t buy this game if you expect to play it And before anyone complains about a negative review a few weeks ago i would have recommended this game to anyone but it is the last patch that created this problem Everything else works perfectly fine and i can play a lot of heavier games without any problems at all,negative

Okay so after 1000 hours of playtime I  gonna give my reviewThe idea behind the game is very good and addictive so addictive in fact that it took me less than a year to get to a thousand hours in game With that said I wouldn t recommend the game if you re looking for a  fair fight  or a game that is highly determined by players  skill Skill of course helps sure but there is just SO much luck involved in winning early and late game fights Early game is pretty much a coin flip It often comes down to if you find a decent weapon quickly Late game you need some luck with the zone but good movement and smart decisions are a factor too In general there is too much luck involved for this game to become an E Sport in my opinion Look all the big popular E Sports are solely skill based and have little to no  luck factor Another hot topic for me is how the devs handle their game The game STILL has countless bugs crashes and glitches that hinder a nice experience Some of them have been prevalent for more than half a year but are still not fixed But for the devs it seemed to be much more important to push the game out of early access and implement microtransactions rather than releasing a polished product And why the heck is there no skill based matchmaking  Matching bad playrers  KD below 1 against aim gods seems unneccessarily unfair Some matchmaking based on the KD or killrating would be very welcome Maybe that way cheaters would end up playing against cheaters who knowsBy the way regions should be locked completely Not only China but all of  em Every region gets to play on their respective servers without the option to choose other servers TL DR  wait till the devs get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together or until it is on sale,negative
Grea battle royale but they did release an unfinished game and has tons of flaws but a lot of the major flaws like servers have been fixed so it is really enjoyable,positive
One for the ages  It is the game weve all waited for Simply perfect,positive
Bought this game a few months ago this was my life for those months Just last month I decided to take a break from the game because the hackers and Chinese players on North America servers were starting to become a huge disadvantage on this game I just played a few rounds after my month off break and I hate to say it but nothing has changed Every round I was final 10 and was either killed by an enemy with the name of  XioChanTinyPenis  that constantly said  CHINA NUMBA HWUAAN  or I was killed by an obvious aimbotter Once this game fixes these issues and I m not expecting the hackers to be permenatelly gone from games I will come back But for now I wouldnt recommend this game,negative

If you some how missed the train while PUBG was super popular Don t get on it now The game is filled with cheaters loot sucks half of the weapons suck the game is still buggy and the killcam is laggy garbage Chinease players are so brash about cheating that they boast about it in voice chat I heard someone loading a gun in the plane earlier WTF happened to this game ,negative
Terrible game Should spend your money on something else,negative
This game is the coolest idea of a jumbled LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing mess I have ever played It had so much potential but the basics of shooting and hit registration are horrid The lag is horrid The deathcam is uselessly laggy I will empty a mag and reload on a guy who eventually kills me yet according to the deathcam he kills me before I even get through half the mag I enjoy hanging with my firiends in this game They are the reason I play it Not the game itselfActually now that I have played for a little while I have discovered that the hit reg is ATROCIOUSLY BAD To the point that in the early game it is unplayable Player Unknown your name goes down next to EA as one to avoid like the plagueIll be sticking to Fortnite Battle royale They grabbed your idea and actually made it good,negative
The hacking in this game makes it virually unplayable and it is only getting worse Started playing in early access and enjoyed despite the bugs Now it is awful I have no problems with the occasional bug that s fine but a game that is centered around competitive multiplayer not getting a handle on rampant aim botting etc is inexcusable Went from being a great playing experience to likely the worst I have ever had the misfortune to endure in just a few months Now they re releasing some mobile BS without providing adequate support  It s disgusting,negative

if they spawned loot at the start of the game would be sweet but you know its hard to do that,negative
what the heck happened to this game  I didn t play for a while came back to see a flashy new loading screen and main menu Thats great and all but now the game runs like crap I used to click play and almost immediately get into a match Now I am waiting minutes staring at a black screen with the PUBG logo Think my PC is frozen alt tab out and then go back into the game only to be throw into a match where my guy is spawned out in the ocean somewhere WTF,negative

I ve been playing PUBG since 2 months after release till this present time and to be honest I ve lost the charm this game gave me From the Old theme song pumping me up to the original wanders crate coat that I couldn t let go and who can forget coming on every week seeing new features bug fixes and new area s to explore In its first year PUBG had so much to offer but now I can barly finish a game without being completly bored I dunno if its the multiple different keys for key crates maybe the 5 Tigar parasuit or maybe its the changes to loot chances Its the fact that in game credits do Jack   to making your character unique from everyone else and whne you have a moblie version brimming with content achievements leveling system dailyweeklymonthly challenges oh and RANKED which was promised ages ago its sad to say I actually enjoy playing the mobile version more than this now Shamless Cash Grab game Its SAD   PS Probably like to mention that been seshing fortnite maybe cas its free constantly updated challenges leveling system soo many character choices and if you play long enough free you can save up Silver and buy the Battle Pass without giving Epic Games a cent Think bout it,negative

Over rated and glitchyToo little variation in the game to warrant a purchase great concept just never executed properly despite a long breadth of time to do so Two maps upon release and even with _double_ the  content  it just never ventured out to where it could and should have Maybe in a sequel they ll do the release a bit more efficiently and effectively and make a purchase worthwhile and long staying ability of the game,negative

Developpers got greedy It s a matter of time that they lose to fortnite Game has a lot of potential but they refused to invest in the game and make it more efficient Poorly optimized buggy laggy even with a powerful GPU and fast internet,negative
Switching to Fortnite cant stand updating my game every week for no results You should focus more on making the servers run smooth rather than trying to add more to the game Love the game but im just sick of 1 out of every 15 games is playable and the rest are laggy or you disconnect for no reason,negative
I have many many issues with this game  First and foremost it was NOT ready for full release CONS  Hit boxes are give or take The issue with players from other regions is out of control Many glitches and problems you have to choke down when you are playing Hackers still exist even though they are working on the problem PROS  Easy to find a game do to its vast popularity Fun game to screw around on After all the hours I have played its just not something I can keep coming back too Even if almost every streamer plays it,negative
Great concept bad developersWhy can t they develop an anti cheat that actually works I don t see any issues with valve s games I have only seen two cheaters both on casual both got kicked I literally saw a guy after this brand new anti cheat update crawling around with no animation just crawling fast I also had someone shoot at me while I was prone behind the metal wall in stadiumNot to mention all of the Chinese who use their high ping to their advantage I could easily just do the same but I don t As much as I would not like a region lock for some people we need it for the abusersI just think that what is really needed is for a new battle royale game to do the concept better more optimized and with a better anti cheat While Fortnite does come to mind I mean one with the more realistic feal of PUBG,negative

Let me start with something good This game is incredibly fun if you like the battle royale style of play The maps are nicely designed  the guns are various and interesting to use and the gun fights  especially in the last 2  3 circles can quicken the heartbeat and when that chicken dinner shows up you feel a great sense of accomplishment at beating everyone elseBut let s move on to the negative which for me is just one thing Cheaters In recent times  beginning of 2018 this game has had a huge influx of those scum sucking toads and it continues to get worse each week despite posts from the company and devs stating they have banned huge amount s of people it has changed nothing As of now 80  of games I play a cheater will ruin your day and feel free to search on the internet to validate my statement I feel it is only fair to warn people to save their money and sanity for when BlueHole finally get ontop of this scourgeFinally I wil add that it is worth keeping an eye on this game as I stated first it is incredibly fun to play but right now not worth you investing money into a game you ll likely get turned away from within a month,positive

Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is run by living human waste The development period of this godforsaken title iswas so despicable I really can t think of a game that matches it For starters even with its PS3 graphics the game will rarely be able to reach 60 FPS on the lowest possible settings  and lower resolution on most midrange machines This optimization problem has persisted since the game s inception and has not been improved significantly  outside of the FPS you get while inside the plane Woo Overall connectivity to servers is occasionally an issue but in a game like PUBG where hit registration can make or break your experience netcode in this title is absolute hot trash and again from my point of view hasn t changed muchenough since launch Hackers are very frustrating when they do appear but are not as prevalent as other reviews make them out to be  at least on the NA server Has PUBG CorpLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  StudiosTencent made a visible effort to change these problems during early accessrecently  Not really They ve been using the hundreds of millions they made from Early Access to wipe their asses make a sloppy cashgrab port to XBOX and create bad paid cosmetics in a 30 title with barely any content It s become abundantly clear that Brendan Greene and PUBG corp are not passionate indie developers but a group of money hungry lepers There aren t many moments in games as exhilirating as being in the top 10 is or rare moments where you get into a serious gunfight where everyone is well geared However after you ve run across the map to the circle for 20 minutes with absolutely no action game after game opened your 20th dirty tank top from a crate  that you had to earn through in game currency AND pay 250 to open or your car has flipped over because the vehicles in this game have the weight of a paper airplane you ll start to become jaded And you ll start to pray that a AAA developer comes out with a better version that kills this game and that can replicate the experience without the problems this game has,negative

Where to start with what s wrong with this game is the real question They pushed for a christmas release and really this game is still in beta as far as I m concerned My number 1 issue with the game above is actual simple playability Look at this forum and videos attached for what I m about to describe https forumsplaybattlegroundscomtopic42649 being shot freezes gameNo matter what your hardware is no matter what settings you play on THIS WILL happen to you You will get a screen freeze every time you are shot at or begin shooting at someone in close quarters Sniper rounds seem to not affect this but this alone is gamebreaking I run a i7 980GTX TI in SLI setup with 32gb of ram and play the game on the lowest settings across the board and still get this screen freeze issue This is the number 1 complained about issue currently maybe next to the zenophobia that seems to plague american s complaining about people speaking another language in their gamesOnto issue 2  It s a world based game where we can play with anyone in the world and they can play with us American s don t seem to get into games like this that often and it s honestly ridiculous how much I have to listen to  explitive explitive explitive china explitive  in literally every single game queue without fail In reality the chinese player base is very friendly even the cheaters are pretty cool guys it s super rare to run into a toxic chinese player yet you re not ever gonna find a PUBG lobby that doesn t have some american yelling to region lock china and send them back where they belong which is bsIssue 3  The cheating in this game is absolutely abhorrent and going uncheckedhttps wwwyoutubecomwatch v3hMi8thYaj0https wwwgiantbombcomforumsplayerunknowns battlegrounds 729798pubg cheating is out of control 1817982Multiple examples here in the above mentioned links and this is in every game It s not  rare  at all it s such a commonplace practice at this point that even MMOwnedCore has links for free aimbots to xray mods The just of it all is that aimbots are everywhere less common is the xray hack which allows people to see an outline of you through buildings wherever you are at all times so they can always know what you re doingwhere you re going etc There s wall hacking mods where people can jumprunshoot through walls without issue my favorite I ve ever seen though is a mod where it turned player models into skyscrapers Literal skyscrapers Imagine 100 skyscrapers just running around a huge open map You shoot at the top of the building and it counts as a headshot no matter where the player was on the map absolutely insane Bluehole keeps saying they re combatting hackingcheatingbanning people but imo they re really not We saw a January release of them attacking hackers the community now believes it was nothing but a large scale banwave  as people went to test old mods and they still work without issue ownedcore and reddit have confirmed a very large list of modshacks after the january  patch  that haven t been affected in the slightestIssue 3  Great game design Horrible community by and large Horrendous publishing company that already had a bad rap from Tera the MMO The worst thing that they re doing and it is widely accepted to be true at the moment is dataminingbitcoing mining off your machine from the login screen Watch your afterburner when you re at the launch screen for PUBG and you will see 90 99  GPU usage no matter what your setup is You get in game and like me with my GTX 980 TI everything at low settings it instantly drops to 30  or lower It s a disgusting practice don t take my word for it though there s a plethora of complaints about it online across multiple forums The worst part however is they re using something called XIGNCODE which looks at all files you ve accessed in the last 48 hours and scans keylogs It s an atrociously invasive game that goes beyond even Facebook s data mining practiceshttps forumsplaybattlegroundscomtopic104174 sitting in main menu pubg is eating 99 of my gpu 970In conclusion Please do not hand this publisher anymore money Please do not play this game as it s got a fun value that lasts about 40 60 hours after you re  used  to the game mechanics and you start making it into the final 10 20 consistently only to realize you re not cheating so the chances of you winning are already slimmer than they should be,negative
First off I have to applaud Brendan Greene for fighting though the hardships of making his game concept a reality through the years of hard work It wasn t easy and took many years but he did it and now is reaping his well earned rewardsSecondly if you have never heard of this new game style is called Battle Royal The concept is amazing You drop in a city of your choice loot kill and fight to find cover in the new play area which is constantly being restricted until one player is left aliveHowever there are some major issues with the game which are  Bad Servers performance Hit detection Audio is only left earright ear also front gun shots sound the same when being shot from the back NOT  71 or even 51 Cheaters of course  you can make money from in game items and the desert map is too big when only 50 people who are left after 15 minwalklootdrive simulator Honestly I think the idea of the game is something that will resonate throughout the gaming industry for a very long time I can understand why Bluehole created the game in a unexpensive way I feel they did this because they had no idea it was going to be so popularCurrently the way the handled their player base complaints in the media was very poor Additonally the lack of fixing the major issues with servers sound and cheating personally leads me to believe that Bluehole is finding it very hard to fix these problems because of the way it was developed or they do not want to put too much more money into the game than is needed They made much more than they expectedThe reason for not wanting to put exorbitants amount of money into this game is I and many of the player base feels something is off in the PUBG air Eventually an established gaming company will release their version of a realistic Battle Royal and PUBG will be a memory of the past which will be referenced in a comical fashion towards other gamesUnless Bluehole finds a way to build their newly founded gaming business and fix these major issues  Server performance Hit detection Audio location Cheating and creating a map that is more suited to the way the rounds playout I feel this game will not last the player base will continue to drop as it has been for some time nowIt is a lot on the table for this newly formed gaming company and I really hope they are able to fix these issues sooner rather than later Finally I would recommend this game purely on the basis of being able to relate towards others after its  day has passed but I would not get over worked with these issues just yet as it is still is in Alpha and was made on the  cheap  This game has major potential  fingers crossed ,positive
Okay I d like to start off saying that this game is fun in concept I enjoy this pseudorealistic combat in a very expansive arena You know why I m disliking this bloody game It is riddled with hackers left and right I can tell you a game on this scale will not be able to catch them all Don t just leave it a region locking a certain country for gameplay otherwise VPNs will just be the next big hit but also region locking the markets would make huge jumps to this game I keep trying to play this game time after time but I always get upset at the end of the match It isn t that hackers can shoot you across the map so much as it is that bluehole doesn t care in the slightest about anything other than money We ve asked for the slightest bit of action and we ve seen absolutely none I hope that this keeps you from making the same mistake I did and bought this game for myselffriends Until I see Bluehole even acknowledge this problem  correctly I will be sticking with Escape from Tarkov,negative
China can have this game,negative
This game literally turned to a CSGO Crate system Before you could use your BP to hopefully get something good by just playing the game but now you use your BP to get a crate that you have to pay 250 forPros You can make friends with chinese players in like a second on NA serversCons Game is not optimizedPlayground for hackersAnti Cheat does not exist,negative

Yes AND No No because they do not get back to you in a reasonable amount of time or not at all in my case There is a bug where my game crashes at launch and i have LITERALLY done everything to fix it So I am SOL until a new update comes out Who knows if that will fix it Yes because the games graphics are excellent and generally the game is pretty good But not being able to play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game for two months is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS I ve sent SO many crash reports and still no fix  asshats,negative
this game is rediculous regionlockChina and the fact that the ping is so horrible all the time you spend 20 minutes running just to get shot by someone who is hacking and you arnt even anywhere near them fix your issues then ill buy it again,negative

This game is great for the gameplay and mechanics Nothing to say about that The only reason I give this game a bad review is because I feel like the game devs give absolutely 0 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about hackers In my last 10 games i ve died a total of 4 time because of hackers Its has they didn t know what to do So untill they get battleye or something like that running this game is unplayeable,negative

this game is really held back by the chinese issue going on right now i have fun playing it but its just impossible to play squads unless you play with friends also getting teamkilled becuase im english really makes me angry since im on the oceanic server like serously bluehole evryone says its a issue so actualy do something about itBut its good and fun gameplay wise,positive

The game is boring most of the time you die right at the start due to the fact that everybody has a weapon but you also half of the time your running to the zone in a car you finaly found after 30 mins of play and 0 kills i would never ever recommend this game to any person Listen and read people dont buy in to this game it has microtransactions poor optimization and overall no replay value,negative
I ve never written a review before so here we are Although I have 145 hours of in game time and I honestly wish I could play it more I can t They kept saying for months that they would optimize the game and fix the server issues It s been 5 months since then and nothing has been fixed The game still runs horribly constant frame drops and crashes even on my 1070 and i5 6600k build One out of every 3 games it freezes and my friends have to leave the game and wait for me to restart the game but even this is problematic because 40  of the time the servers are busy The network lag is just as unbearable I have around 60mgb download and still whiplash horribly One of the solutions that could help with the network game is to region lock the countries that play it Most of the players on the North American servers are Asian which is bad for a few reasons One is communication you can t play a tactical shooter with people that can t speak a lick of English Second is network stress on the servers massive amounts of people on a continent on the other side of the planet is a strain on the server and in turn causes me to lag while they have little or no affect from lag because the servers are working to keep them connected To add salt according to Brendon Greene the head developer 99  of hackers come from China Why not region lock China if it would solve most of these problems  According to the head developer himself  You re racist and Xenophobic if you don t want to play with Asians  This is a huge insult to the people who want to enjoy the game that they bought from you410,negative
i recommend this game for any gamer who enjoy dying to cheaters,negative

Great concept that got alot of attention and alot of people gettin rich but very poor game overall biggest problem is the latency and server lag For a shooter these things are basic fundamentals with the hundreds of millions the developerspublishers made you would think they make a better product but no they just add more content that you will need to give them more money for Games like this will kill off the gaming industries popularity you cant just charge people for a concept that is very poorly executed People are looking for an experience and paid good money but mostly they are decieved into buying garbage Think the money the devs made totally corrupt there outlook and they got greedy Do not buy Dont support lazy greedy devs,negative

Over 30 million copies sold15 million cheaters bansadd in some lagsubtract a practice areatutorialtoo small amount of time to loot and voila PuBg They have a lot of stuff to fix in this game I find myself fighting the zone way more than I do fighting people With not enough time to loot and little experience with all the guns  BECAUSE PUB HAS NO PRACTICE MODE I get shot up from people skimming the outer edges of the play zones Its just dumb this game needs to give more time to loot I can t find anything and I drop in the rural areas as to avoid the first 5 minute deaths but I still clear about 10 12 buildings The drops are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I should at least be able to find 1 fully kitted gun after that many buildings but half the time its low tier gunsshotguns Then you re forced to run for the zone half the time ill equippedYou can also fall prey to thinking you re doing damage when you re really not I ve had rounds where I have 15 20 hits  Red mist kicking up so I know I m  hitting but come to find out at the end of a round i ve only done about 10 20 dmg So lag is a serious issue as the shots don t register even though they look as if they do Which the end result is you just giving away your position or trying to trade with someone that has a better connection than youThis is a particularly huge problem in close quarters combat I have buddies that play in EU and I m in NA  everytime someone tries to rush my building I die because they can run and gun and in replays I get maybe 5 shots off Its just annoying The third person is clunky and counter intuitive and the first person is very tacked on In short it took me 20 hours to realize this game isn t worth buying Will let you know if I get a refundEDIT  After getting denied a refund I tried to keep playing and discovered the aiming in this game is probably one of the worst I ve experienced in any shooter Really PubG  You need to give sensitivity ratings to every scope because you made your game so badly that instead of fixing a horrendus shooting experience meh screw it just let them fiddle with the sensitivities until they can get something that resemembles an FPS This game sucks and I regret buying it Save your money unless you like playing with hackers and bad shooting mechanics Unless you have a high powered future machince you re going to hate this game as much as I do Several thumbs down,negative

I love this game to death I love the style and the gameplay I have put more time into this game than any other game that I own I would recommend this game in a heart beat BUT There is a huge negative that cripples this game like Franklin D Roosevelt  polio and that is CHINESE F     G HACKERS They absolutely plague this game with their over abundant presence in lobbys that predominently would speak english  NA and Oceanic servers and their hacksThis game would be so much more bearable if the hacking was actually successfully cut off Not to mention region locking or at the very least ping capping the servers that belong to each regionPUBG Corporation has milked their cash cow long enough They ve lined their pockets It s time they finally lay down some law and fix this otherwise amazing gameOVERALL  I love this game but I will not recommend this game purely because of the amount of hackers and non English speaking players on predominently English speaking servers This is a problem that needs to be addressed now If they region lock or ping cap I will change my reviewCHINA 1 AT HACKING AND MAKING IT WHERE I CANNOT FIND ONE ENGLISH SPEAKER IN A NORTH AMERICAN SERVER,negative

I ll post the same thing I sent to Blue Hole in this review as a short preface I love this game  only 200 hours I m a dad who gets some play times at the end of the night and I usually make sure it s playing your game I love it The competition the guns the boundaries All of it I love it so muchBut the reason I m writing you today is because I am disgusted by the high amount of cheaters in the game now It isn t just one or two anymore North American servers are flooded with cheaters Sadly I think I m going to have to cut your game loose until I can be assured you are dealing with them I ve noticed all of them have Asian names and I ve heard other players mentioning region locking China Are you guys considering this  I don t want to leave your game I think I m a decent player but the auto aim s are insane I report all of them but tonight I played THREE games out of three my team won the first and the next two we were plagued by auto aiming and out of line of sight shooting hackers I go back and watch the death cam and its so belligerentPlease tell me there is a plan in place to take care of this I want to believe in your gameAfter that I uninstalled the game Why  My buddies and I constantly get top 10 and most games we win I m not great but I play with a good group of friends But I m not going to support a company that minimizes the cheating and just brushes it off They can talk about all the anti cheating stuff they want every game I m playing has ridiculous cheaters I went from loving the game to dreading seeing XainBoCan90 or some other username killing hordes of people with his Kar98 without a scope from inside of a building from across the map I m done being a tool for themRegion lock China,negative
I would love to love this game but the owner and developers of the game rushed the game to 10 for Christmas As a result it s going to go down as one of the biggest failures in gaming history Yes the game has millions of people playing but when the game crashes 8 out of every 10 times you try to start you run into cheaters every match game phyiscs that make absolutely no sense client side hit detection that allows hjigh latency players to use lag as an advantage oh and so many many more issues you re going to be replaced by a major game studio that will not only deliverable a quality product but it will be void of all those issues from day one of game relase In its current state this is not a 10 game Anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves You can see that Bluehole is trying to make the game better but each time they add an update it makes the game worse and breaks something You would think they would test each pach for more than a 12 hour window on the test server but it s clear they do not attempt to do that and rush each patch only to be left trying to fix the patch that was supposed to fix another issue If the owner doesn t step up and take responsbility for the games failures region lock the game and admit they rushed the game I give this game 12 months before it s gone and has less people playing than H Hour does  Developers managed to take in several hundred million dollars in the process so I honestly don t think they could care less Can you blame them ,negative

 DISCLAIMER I DO NOT HATE ASIANS Hello This is Shirskiy I play a ton of steam games and mass over 8000 hours of gameplay on all of my games combined so far And I have to say this PUBG is a very good game It s challenging Fun Better than it s inferior competitors H1Z1 and Fortnite And the game is an overall 1010 Except for one damn thing Chinese players are hopping from Asian servers to US and Oceania Servers  US Servers being USA Mexico Canada and upper central American And Oceania being Australia New Zealand and Indonesia Chinese players that come to these servers are abusing the high ping and often times I die by someone I just downed because the ping is so bad China is across the world from the USA which makes ping super hard I think China should be Region Locked This is also because 99  of the Hacks for PUBG are coming from Chinese websites I will now list the Pros and ConsPROS  The game is very competitive It s very successful and rarely glitches or crashes This game takes bullet drop and range into account The weapons are for the most part realistic They have realistic grenades and throwablesCONS  Don t plan on playing this with a GTX 960 or below on ultra settings If you do There goes your CPU Small Variety of guns Chinese Hackers and Ping Abusers Brandon Greene  Creator of PUBG Is calling everyone who calls for a region lock  Xenophobic   So Basically a snowflake owner Unrealistic Vehicles Small Variety of Vehicles A pan isn t bulletproof Randomly banning people who kill streamers for  Steam Sniping  These people are just trying to play the game Randomly banning people who counter teamkill to save their own life  Really Brandon  Poor Server Policy  Most Chinese players go from Asian servers to American servers because their own servers are poorly moderated and kept Lack of responsability Causing Steam to shift from a mostly english site to a mostly chinese site Microtransactions even though they made a large sum of cash on the people who purchased the base game as isSo Overall it gets a negative review until it fixes a few of their issues One being serverlocking asian players I can t understand what Kim over here is saying because I m not Chinese ServerLockChina,negative

Let s be honest here the game is fun to play With over 400 hours played on a i7 6700hq and gtx 960m laptop the game had issues and needed to run on 1600x900 with low settings to maintain 40 50 FPS It was still doable and I was able to still be relatively competable with my friends who have built PC s I recently built a pc  Ryzen 7 2700x and zotac gtx 1080ti and it is like playing a different game I am playing on 1440p resolution and run about 100fps on average with highultra settings I am able to see players at a distance and my performance in up close combat has improved tenfold On both PC s I have ran into a minimal amount of issues Before it offically released the issues were more prevalent but after release I rarely run into any issues such as lagging out or game crashes I am disappointed in the optimization by Bluehole but it does not deter me from playing The addition of keys for 250 to open crates that you buy with ingame rewarded currency is about the dumbest thing The game lacks motivating factors to play without friends While I do like the addition of gun skins and different customizable clothing I feel like they need to focus on making the game playable without issue for the majority of players before adding things that do not affect gameplay I play for the competition I have played the past 2 seasons of Fortnite after many hours on PUBG Fortnite s challenges and battle pass idea makes it worth getting on everyday whether I have friends to play with or not PUBG still feels more competitive but the games can drag on only to be snipedshot in the backkilled by the blue zone If you are wondering if you should buy this game with so many bad reviews I say buy it and join the fun With a proper PC it will be worth it However if you are on the fence and your PC is on the lower end do not buy it It will feel like a waste of money It is like playing on a nintendo 64 while your competition is on a PS4,positive

Great concept terrible executionThe game is very buggy even after it s supposed  full release The game is fun but that fun dies off after awhile of playing and the game starts to become boring and repetitiveThe game also has an abundance of hackers even after the patchesNot recommended in the game s current state wait until the majority of bugs glitches and hackers are dealt withK thx bye,negative

you ll spend most of the game desperatly trying to  reach the next combat zone only to either die outside or to be gunned down by a hackerthe only thing this game does better than fortnite so far is the quality of their servers  scratch that their servers are even worse that in early access i m just glad i don t have to deal with chinese hackers like the americans and australians servers do,negative

PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds  PUBG is a multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation a subsidiary of Korean publisher Bluehole The game is based on previous mods that were developed by Brendan  PlayerUnknown  Greene for other games using the 2000 film Battle Royale for inspiration and expanded into a standalone game under Greene s creative direction In the game up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves The available safe area of the game s map decreases in size over time directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters The last player or team standing wins the roundThe game was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam s early access beta program in March 2017 with a full release on December 20 2017 That same month the game was released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program By the end of the year the Steam version had sold over twenty four million copies and held a peak concurrent player count of over three million making it the most played game on the platform while the Xbox One version sold over four million itself a month after release The game is planned to be localized and released by Tencent in China including two different mobile device versions exclusive to the countryBattlegrounds received several positive reviews from critics during both its early access period and on final release  reviewers found that while the game still was not fully finished and had some technical flaws Battlegrounds presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable The game received several nominations for Game of the Year and other awards for 2017 and is considered the defining game of the battle royale genre Several other video games following in Battlegrounds s success added battle royale style modes while a number of clones primarily out of China also appeared PUBG Corporation anticipates Battlegrounds to become an eSport and has run several small tournaments and introduced in game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators,positive

This was one of my favorite games when it first came out Was over the CODBattlefield BS and this game was very hardcore with 2 3 chest shot kills and 1 2 head shot kills Unfortunately recently they have made changes I m guessing to appeal to the COD crowd to get them to play So now just like COD you can shoot someone center mass 6 7 8 9 10 times hell dump the whole mag in them and somehow they are still alive and well then turn around and shoot you in the head 1 time even though you have a level 2 or 3 helmet and down you go So unless they go back to and more realistic hardcore 2 3 shot kill game like it was in the beginning I can t recommend this game Not to mention the sync and lag issues which may be contributing to above stated If you are a COD fan and want another game like COD that isn t in outer space or whatever they are doing now then I guess this is the game for you in its current state If you want a different game that was suppose to be more realistic like I think the way it was intended to now is not the time to buy When it first came out I felt like everyone pretty much had a chance Now if you don t spend 50 hrs a week playing it you are screwed,negative

Great fun game Is it perfect  Not even close but I am hoping over time PUBG can finally do a better job with cracking down on the hacking  region lock china to start and improving the game s optimization For now I enjoy it for what it is and still throw a fist in the air when the squad lands that illustrious Chicken Dinner,positive
The novelty of this game is definitely apparent but when you start winning consistently and get to 100 hours its novelty is outweighed by the bad netcode very average visuals even running 4K60FPS and poor developing which is starting to show with the inclusion of mechanics like paid loot boxes But the one thing that ruins it above all is the hackers and streamers It is absolutely rife with hackers especially Chinese as well as streamers who live on this game and use soft aimbots to make them look like they have skill in their streams It becomes apparent how much of a problem with hackers this game has when you look at the statistics for hackers banned per week or month which may look good but hackers being banned from one account will not stop them from simply making a new one and carrying on When this game dies it will die very quickly people who overcome the learning curve for this game like myself have no real appeal to this game anymore which is poor considering after 110 hours i am already done with this game not a great deal of time in this generation of gaming,negative

Best gaming experience ever even more powerful than some games fortnite  ,positive
The game was great when it first came out The developers listened to the players and fixed a lot of things the community reported They promised no micro transactions until the full game came out but they went back on their word Then they implemented crappy skins and created a mobile version of the game when the community asked for optimization and bug fixes The developers stopped listening to the community and the game is quickly spiraling down the same road that H1Z1 and Day Z went It s just another Battle Royale game where the devs stopped caring,negative

Giving you crates as in game rewards that are only able to be opened with real world currency is next level scumbag  This game is mediocre at best and the only actual unlock in the game is locked behind a currency that becomes less valuable  the more you attain it which limits how many boxes you can get each week  The fact that you need to pay 250 to open a box that you can only sell for 029 is actually a complete waste of time,negative
This game is trash now cause you dont want to region lock china even though its full of a bunch of hackers Your systematically ruining your own game and losing your fan base,negative

Playerunknown s Battlegrounds or PUBG as it is known throughout the gaming community is a battle royale type shooter While it does give you the option to play in 3rd person perspective  TPP I found that playing it in First Person Perspective was more enjoyable due to the fact that TPP allows players to see 360 degrees around their location which means that you can often be seen when you dont even realize you should be able to be seen FPP is definitely the  more realistic approachThe game concept is relatively simple You are flown over the map and must parachute to an area of your choosing Once you land you must begin you search to rapidly find weapons ammo armor and medical supplies before you run into another player All the while the Blue Zone is closing down you The blue zone is an electric circlular barrier that starts at about 4 kilometers in diameter and shrinks constricting the battlefield every so often until it is only several feet across Occupying that circle are the lone survivors who must battle it out till the last man stand Your mission is to kill or be killed Should you make all the right moves and have luck on your side you will be the last player alive and win the gamePUBG can be a very exciting game Finding the best weapons scopes and gear on a constant treasure hunt is very enjoyable However should you not give the blue zone the respect it demands you can find yourself spending the whole game running from it to get to the next safe area Some times that run never ends and the blue zone wins as your body falls lifeless in the middle of nowhere as the rest of players on the other side of the map battle it out PUBG does come with it s technical issues however PUBG corp has been hard at work to try to eliminate these issues on a regular basis One of the main issues this game suffers from is hackers Hackers from all over the world  especially China have inundated this game  PUBG continues to ban thousands even millions and China has even made arrests of the hack developers and distrubitors yet the hacking persists Recently PUBG deployed a new anti hack tool We can only hope that it helps keep the hackers controlled before they ruin an amazing game I highly recommend PUBG to everyone However be warned if you are the sensitive type this game may not be for you You can do every thing right get all the best gear and still lose a gun battle or be killed in a vehicle accident Luck does play a role in this game Be prepared for anything and you will be ok I have seen too many players rage quit because they fail to accept the role that luck does play I go into this game with an open mind and looking to just have fun Some days I am the hero and other days I am the zero That is PUBG life,positive
Excellent game Watch out for copy cats,positive
totally worth buying it,positive
i played this game for 2 hours like 3 matches or 4 and in all of them i spend around 20 min running like an idiot looking for some other players so it was booring as hell the map is huge the chinese just toke over this game cause i was in the NA server and all of my squad team mates were chinese so you better guest if you dont spend mandarin you re LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  mulplayer experience and sadly this is a multiplayer game so it sucks in some ways but i has some good points too sadly they are not that relevant to make a great game its just an ok game,negative
You know let me start by saying this game was a lot of fun  However for the past 2 3 months the game has been PLAGUED by cheaters And not the kind where its debatable if he was actually better than you or there might be a bit lag No i am talking serious wall hacks target snapping no recoil automatic assault rifle hacks It s so frustrating getting killed by someone who has  a wallhack on when you finally find the perfect load out  silenced Scar decked out Silenced Kar98k with 8x scope This doesn t happen a lot or only towards the last 5 minutes of the game when you kill enough other players for the loot It s so frustrating when someone who hacks kills you then and it happens ALL THE DAMN TIME They say they fixed it the game is fun for 2 3 days then the hacks come right back LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this I can t reccomend a game that has made millionsbillions and still has 17 hertz MP servers and does nothing to combat hacks,negative
I bought this game back in May 2017 and while I really want to say I love this game I just can t There are too many problems with it A ton of hackers still and holes in the desert map when 10 has been out for what two months now  That s ridiculous And don t even get me started with lag I don t know what it could possibly be but it s not like my computer is a complete potato with a GTX 970 an Intel i5 4690 at 35 Gigahertz and 8 gigs of ram and my interent isn t terrible at 100 mbps yet whenever I get remotely close to anyone in the game that isn t from America  Cough  Cough please region lock China Cough Cough why are they even playing on North America servers Cough Cough  my game might as well crash because I will freeze consistantly for a solid 30 seconds and then once it unfreezes I find that I am dead Don t even get me started about how long it takes for me to load into the matches either though that is mainly a problem with my Seagate HDD than enything else But don t get me wrong though I do like the game Before 10 I had almost none of the problems that I have mentioned above exception to loading into the match that was still a stupid amount of time and that was when I was still running on a 20 mbps internet I enjoy the game and I have put many hours into it but I have founf it really unenjoyable lately because of the hackers no region lock and the unbelievable amount of lag Please fix your game Mr Green so the majority of us can enjoy it once again,negative

Lets see When this game came out I was really happy that it did the Arma 3 Mod PUBG was just awesome But this game is just horrible I think I can say that i know a thing or two about FPS This game combines everything that sucks In my opinion does the Hitbox suck worse than in Rainbow Six the Netcode is awful the overall movement of the people is unbelievably unrealistic like some rubber dolls having a stroke I played this game a lot cause secretly this genre always fascinated me you wont believe me how much DayZ Mod I played But this game is just bad They make it worse and worse with every update And dont even get me started with the server reliability just check out literally every review under this game I am just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing curious how can a Team with such LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing much money not get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  done  I mean they literally earned MILLIONS and there is only 2 maps now  Give me 10 Mins in Stronghold World Creator and I make better LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  than that and weapon variety  Its a joke,negative

It was hard to decideI think the game is great even if it has big flawsI like having fun in video games and hate it when people take it too far with competitive gameplay I cant stand people that     rage all over team chat when a glitch or a bug appears and gets them killed I usually laugh at situations like that Sometimes i get mad too when a bug or a glitch ruins my gamebut still the game is realistic  bullet dropbullet travel timerecoil Another thing that i really hate is cheatingCmon why cheati never cheated in a video game before and im happy that i didnt i still dont get the point of cheating and this game has a lot of cheaters The graphics are quite good in my opinionbut i think the game still needs optimizationi gave it a positive review even though it has a lot of glitches and hackers I think the true meaning of videogames is having fun alone or with friends,positive

Just want to make it shot and clear last update f   ed it up,negative
Still missing promised features like custom games and dynamic weather still riddled with bugs and awful driving physics  gotta love getting killed because your jeep hit a pebble  and cheating is still rampant The awful loot box system with incredibly low drop rates for anything not common is just the icing on the turd They really should be offering refunds at this point Do yourself a favor and play the better battle royale game Fortnite which is even free,negative
The game itself is awesome but is riddled with hackers The lead Dev is some SJW who refuses to region lock because it s  xenophobic  despite their anti cheat BattleEye proving that 99  of the hackers are from China 6k   20k hackers from China are banned DAILY,negative

It is getting worse and worse since the game s  RELEASE  It s optimization is acceptable at best and you can hardly play in a squad because someone will crash at loading screen EVERY GAME Servers are lagging as hell and if you think you are saved because you survived the first 5 minutes of dead servers blueball surprises you with server crash or super rubberband effect which is always fun You can stuck into objects after vaulting over them and the  EXTRA AMAZING NEW MAP  is not optional because it s hard to skip 5 minutes of your lunch brake and make a damn checkbox to give players the choice Calling this game released should be a crime This could be a very good game as far as concepts but rookie developers shouldn t try to achieve something that is clearly out of reach Fix the game because it s good as is and add things after the current content is okay,negative

First of all i love this game But  alot can be fixed the new map is wonderful and there are alot of people who are probably with me on this one it is very hard to tell a hacker from a reg player and there are many cases where i have been killed by a hacker who ended up winning the game or coming close to it other than that this game is my favorite adding 1 new weapon per map is a miskake though maybe adding multiple weapons and maybe some gear to go along with the map would make even more people decide to play it,positive

Originally i loved this game and if it wasn t for the stability i would still do But as i experienced it with every patch the game gets more unstable In our 4 man squad AT LEAST every second match someone drops because the game crashes it doesn t load in the first place or some other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t It s really fruststrating if you survived to the last 12 or something and then you get a disadvantage because someone in the squad just freezes Get it fixed and i will totally recommend this game again Until then  keep your hands off its not playable anymore,negative
This is the game that has a lot of potential It is not easy to master and you have to invest a lot of hours so you could be slightly better than others The graphics are good and it is a lot of fun to play with your friendsHowever PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS has a lot of minuses By saying a lot I mean really A LOT Not only the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up  you can feel desync easily when you get shot behind the wall even after you ran there like 1 2s before you should ve been shot and the game is highy unoptimized but also there are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of bugs Sometimes you do not connect to the game Sometimes you try to reconnect to it but you cannot because  Connection Failed  Sometimes you hit the invisible wall while running in the open Sometimes you randomly die because you get triple damage while sliding few meters of the hill or getting stun half a metre in the air and suddenly touch the ground or vault on places such as supply drops or many other places in the desert mapSo almost one year has passed and there has been only minor fixes and changes However there are still many more major LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fiesta things left to fix I don t know what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  are developers waiting for since they got LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of money and could invest into development so they could make things happen faster than crappy patches every 1 2 months past half year Yes the game still has and had a lot of potential but it is quickly fading away and I hope they will fix their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up LIDL10,negative
Nope,negative
In my opinion latest updates have almost gone backwards due to the Xbox One stuff but still gotta give this game it s credit with a review saying there s no battle royale that s even close to the feeling of a game of PUBG If you haven t picked it up you ve obviously seen gameplay and have decided either it doesn t look like it s for you or you re just too poor to buy it at the moment in which case I ll see you around the battlegrounds once you can get it,positive

This is for your extremely bad patch on February 7th I don t care cheaters because I believe I am able to kill cheaters with my skills But I CANNOT stand the negative optimization of this game It has been almost 1 year since PUBG was released However the optimization is so bad and I can t run it smoothly even when I updated my hardware with 1070 graphics card and 7700 cpu which are more than enough for me to run other better games such as GTA Nier  Automata or any other 3A games My average FPS is over 100 before and after I updated my PUBG with the 29m patch on February 7th my average FPS now dropped to less than 60 and it brought so much bad experience on this game Shame On Your Bad Work Did you just put on your patch without any test  Never saw any game companies did the same as you did For now This game is selling well     SO YOUR TAKE YOUR MONEY YOU DO YOUR JOB,negative
Great game considering the price Quite a few latency issues on the servers My biggest gripe is EVERY time they update the servers are down 2 hours longer than what they say it will be I still love the game but that is a considerable issue,positive
Crashes all the time with bad_module_info I ve tried playing in windowed and I ve disabled Windows game bar stuff Terrible game support Don t buy this game,negative
Honest to god Bluehole get your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together already why take the game out of Early access when you dropping bombs of updates constantly what so you can make sales faster cause all you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  heads care about is money Remove the full release back to EA and make proper optimizations coming from that side real dumb choice to release a agme thats developed like crap Don t get me wrong I aint no developer but this is just a ridiculous joke already ALL ABOUT THE MONEY Maybe hire some better professionals to fix your crap already now we have to wait like 3   6 hours to jump back on because can t manage servers  sigh my dudes Great game but get your BS together,positive
I really enjoy this game and think that it s fantastic game to play with friends and getting to the final circle feels so good Winning is even better and so rewarding There s a few bugs with driving but I feel it catches more flack than it deserves as driving around full speed on a motorcycle hitting jumps is super fun especially with friends as it usually elicits a lot of laughs Hackers suck and make  14 games unplayable but overall this is by far my favorite game right nowWith that being said                                    ,positive
Would love to see what you folks have to say after this is over   Downtime is fine just curious that this happend,positive
Needs region lock and a working hack detector and then it would be sweet,positive
Adding first person mode killed the game for me It s just nowhere near realistic enough to rely on first person mode ballistics and it s seemingly all my friends want to play anymoreA very fun casual online multiplayer experience though,positive
Over all awesomeness,positive
As good as this game is it is a long way from being worth 40You can t even get into the game after 10 pm Mountain Time because servers are too busy and there are many small bugs that ruin gameplay like the parachute randomly getting cut off damaging your player and enemy players getting headshots from long distances with iron sights or red dots  some may be skill but the sheer number of times it happens makes that seem unrealisticI do really like this game when I am lucky enough to get a decent server but I can t recommend it to anyone for 40Plus the fact that to get access to the early bird loot crate I need to buy a key is insulting to anyone who supported this game from early on,negative

Don t recommendCrate system is basically gambling and partly why third person matchmaking is filled with hackers Bluehole milking their paid for player base by making them buy keys for a chance at a rare item Game struggles to matchmake Long times spent tryingCommunity fairly toxic Netcode is problematic for players with higher ping Maps are too big and midgame can get really boring Weapons system unbalanced SMGs OP Auto matchmaking often leaves one alone in a 1 v 2 1 v 4 as PUBG can t find teammates Shrinking player base,negative

This game is a ton of fun I really enjoy it Only real issues are the presence of some cheating  though it s not too terrible One in 6 games may feature 1 and you can report them when it s discovered and that servers aren t region locked so a lot of foreign players appear in other servers In it of itself not a huge deal but many almost exclusively Asian players have poorer connections or cheat Again only 1 in 6 games will have these issues though All in all HIGHLY reccomend,positive
Good stuff sonny boy,positive
Ok there are some flaws in this game but it s SO MUCH FUN Mostly I solo drop in the middle of nowhere gear up and hunt these fools down I won t say I win but I do enjoy my time which is far more important to me Apparently there iswas cheating issues but I don t come across it There are some terrain issues and vehicle issues but they are more funny than frustrating Recently I ve been dropping with friends and that makes it a completely diffrent game,positive

YO you guys at pubg better make this game better and actually add some more logic to it I know it has to do with game balancing but seriously  If im getting shot at i should know where tf the enemy is Like what the hell dude if im getting shot at my back i would know the enemy would be behind me because the bullet would be stuck in back I know it would be unfair to add the direction of where the enemy is by being shot but can you         add a feature or texture where when you get shot you would see blood pouring out of a certain area of your body so you would have a theory of where the person is shooting you at  If you guys add this in BIG THANK YOU if not WHERE IS THE LOGIC IN THE GAME    Or at least that would be what im questioning right now,positive
so ive played on and off and thoroughly have enjoyed playing this game but recently all i have encountered is hackers lag and an infestation of asians in oceanic servers the game was worth the money when it first came out but lately that has gone in reverse this game is on the verge of breaking and id hate for such a good game to be tossed in the trash at the games current state i would not recommend this game,negative

Got this game last summer when it was on early accessInitially guns have low recoil and fightings are fun and interesting like CSGOGave up on Overwatch and CSGO at that time considered this as was the best fps game Eating chicken and winning games are the most satisfactory experience everThen more and more hackers are coming to the game and in every single match Your so called  optimizations  are bringing more fps drops in game Now absolutely every single game there s tons of hackers and leaving regular players absolutely no way to counter them and there are always people selling hacks in game and bluehole s not even trying to ban them The recent patch was the WORST patch at all you bluehole s  making game more competitive  strategy deliberatly amplifies most in game gun shot coils which you guys in bluehole thought was a good strategy lol yeah a better way to help hackerscheaters to get kills and win games Also there s no more a thing called  rank  because in every single game I could see players that are incredibly  professional  or hackers rather than ranking different players in different games  which it SHOULD happen in most competitive gamesThe game is no longer fun and has more toxicity Now everyone is hiding in somewhere only wishing to kill others by one shot because there s no way one can win the fight with hackersIn conclusion the experience I had in this game in general is bad and I have had no more fun than before I am considering it as DEADGAME and not recommending them to my friends any more Going back to play old fps games and will be trying PUBG mobile and Fortnite instead Thank you bluehole,negative
Unfinished product even though it s supposedly out of early access  Devs seem more interested in creating ways to milk their playerbase than actually finishing their damn game,negative

AMAZING GAME but the only downside to the game is the Asian s that come over to the North American servers and that they have such a high ping and 90  of them are hacking with Aimbots if they can region lock China this game would be one of the BEST GAMES EVER but for right now it sucks becuase of all the hacking and high ping players from China,negative

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a nice concept for a video game but currently it is buggy poorly optimized and it just does not feel right This game is unfinished The pictures look promising nevertheless in my opinion this game does not deserve the  hype  it is getting I requested a refund and got my money back since you are better off watching a gameplay on YouTube My advide  Do not buy it because short after you will certainly regret it,negative
very nice gameall my money on himover 150h in 1 week,positive
pretty game but dont play this if u dont wanna be mentaly ill,positive
HackerUnknown Hackergrounds This game is failing because the bans on hackers are not IP bans So the hackers get another account and do it all over again But it is the way PUBG stays on the top of seller list so I dont expect any changes The hackers unfortunately are the only players PUBG cares about  makes money off of,negative
Hello everyone the game of the jedi survival the Chinese players have a lot of this is also the beginning of the problem because some people use the system problem to cheat Let you feel angry here on behalf of Chinese people say I m sorry I hope you will continue to play I also like to play games with you I can t do anything so I m sorry I hope that we can continue to hope for the game also want you to believe me It s just my opinion I m sorry I m really sorry As a Chinese I can t do anything ,positive

when this game came out it was pretty decent little glitches here and there however since the implementation of the crate system it has gone down hill to where id recommend you to save the 2999 and go buy two cases of icehouse much more fun just played  6 20 minute games in which 4 of the 6 ended in a random chinese played headshotting me across the map full auto without visual sight The cheating in this game is unreal please save your moneysincerelya NA that plays on NA servers full of chinese cheaters,negative

The gunplay is beyond stiff Theres no real fluid to it you get cought on the edges of things all the time its EXTREMELY annoying I mean Im not asking much interms of being more smooth it doesnt need to be buttery smooth like Doom or rigid yet smooth like Arma 3  I just dont want it to feel like im controlling a lego character BTW all these reviews talking about the chinese problem its real The problem is so bad I have played 8 matches total  i know thats low i refunded this 3 of those matches im pretty sure I was killed by a hacker How else does one get headshot in a windowless bathroom and sprinting through an office building Along with all these wonderful perks of playing with our PC brothers 7000 miles away the lag makes everything super jumpy Its hard to play an FPS when the other guy teleports behind you like Goku Dont get me wrong I dont hate this game I actually like it but the state it is in feels like a beta No cheater detection  or punishment slugish stiff gunplay and movement and one massive server everyone plays on  pfffffftt like they couldnt afford more servers If they fix those things especially the gun play and movement Ill totally come back  but for right now im gonna wait for another battle royale clone to come out that fixes this glaring issuesBTW fortnite sucks,negative
Not recommend at allDue to plenty of hackers this game was totally ruined Pretty similar like H1Z1 Because eventually everyone likes to play a fair game the cheaters killed everything Not playing anymore until this fixed,negative
This review is subject to change I ve played since Alpha and had to deal with hackers constantly That s annoying but what has now become more annoying is the NA servers having players from china come on It wouldn t be bad if they spoke English My whole game is dealing with a language barrier and it pisses me off I get english speaking players 1 out of 15 games So unless you have friends on or you can understand asian languages this might be great for you If you have no friends and can t speak anything other than english Buy something else You took my money now fix the servers Even a soft lock on servers would be great Like the only way a chinese person can be on NA is if he s grouped with NA players You do that and you fixed a huge issue,negative

Honestly even without the Chinese hackers this game would still be a rushed push to release with easily the worst performance of any modern game I ve seen Removing the crippling   unstoppable frame rate issues and the Chinese hackers   still  the game is a seemingly poorly coded abomination with a game breaking bug in about half of the games you play If you like slideshows on the NASA supercomputer rubberbanding back to the same location for minutes at a time exploding because you drove over a pebble being killed over and over by hackers being screwed by terrible looting game breaking   exploitable bugs then this game should be a great match for you,negative
Game use to be good Back in the day you would never see a cheater now  for some reason the Devs have allowed a swarm of cheaters to play and they are doing nothing about it It is literally nothing but obvious cheaters and Bluehole is doing NOTHING about it Seriously Don t waste your money But a different game Don t buy  looting Getting aimbotted simulator ,negative
It s crap to be honest,negative

If the developers doesn t do anything with the hackers infestation I will spend my time on another game  Even with the horrendous bugs I had a good time playing it but with the hackers there is a different story  Playing a game for 30 minutes  with only two people left and the other person is a hacker with auto aim and firing on auto with a M16  That is no fun at all  And for the cherry on top they want to charge 250 for a stupid key to open the new damn crates  Ridiculous,negative

I came back to this game after about a month s hiatus All of my friends had stopped playing it and they were the only reason I had continued to play this game after my initial negative review It can honestly be a fun time with friends  by fun I mean humorous but in my opinion solo is just pointless Like everyone else on here I ve played a lot of shooters Almost never through all the years that I ve played games like CounterStrike Call of Duty Overwatch and even Battlefield  except for 4 which was a mess for a while have I felt like the game itself was consistently screwing me or somebody else over in a match But PUBG does I m not even talking about when it s me doing the dying Sometimes I land kills where I m like  Yeah that was stupid  I m not an expert on desync and lag and whatnot especially when it s not the kind that s right in your face but something makes this game incredibly inconsistent each time I play The guns never feel like they are doing the same thing twice And there seems to be a lot updates but they don t feel like they re changing anything on more than a cosmetic level It s a shame because I ve played a few Royale games now and I know I like this genre and I like the style of PUBG the best which is why I ve put so many hours in But at some point you just can t keep taking the punishment for playing it,negative
Promising as a general ideaBut bad as hell This game gets quickly lame Not recommended even if you have a squad,negative
game is broken but greedy devs want money so they sell it physics is absolutely dead  you may stack in texture and never get out of it and of course lags also help you to play its like you run in one direction then game dont react on your commans and after 5   20 seconds you apper in absolutely new plase like 200   300 meters from  freeze starting point  and game also includes crying kids  i wonder i should listen them in planeTnx so much im very satisfied and now want to permanently delete this  game   ,negative
Too much Hacker,negative
Start region lock and stop blaming the player racist it is a game playing issue Players have high ping can play whatever the server they want is screwing the balance of the game,negative
Hackers are in every game which has now ruined the game entirely Chinese hackers get kills and win games This allows them to earn points to receive in game points and items that can be sold for real money  This completely ruins the game for everyone who actually wants to play  But still the developers refuse to region lock China,negative
Good game Poor players Region lock chinese,negative
If you want to spend 20 mins gathering weapons and items then get shot instantly by aimbottingwallhacking cheaters then this game is for you,negative
The game is great besides when you get players that instant quit or when you get enough in game points to buy a game which then keeps giving crates that require yourself to buy keys just to open them where there 250 a pop and you might get a item thats worth 5 thats the only thing you would have to worry about the rest of the game is good just the the crate and people quiting right at the start or other things,positive

I would love to give this game a good review I honestly would This game is fun and very rewarding IF you can get past the horrible server problems and hackers that plague this game The 10 update is just for show this game is by no means a finished product I do not recommend this game as it is  although the developers have stated that they will dedicate 2018 to polishing the game and making it better instead of adding cosmetics like they did from launch up until now Just wait for it to go on sale if it ever does or wait until it gets better Spend your money wisely,negative
The devs really don t give any LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s about the playersEdit  The devs pushed out a patch that fixed network issues  which was one of the major complaints about the game by most people so I m changing my review to positive for the time being,positive
PUBG is the game worth its money may have some bad spots but worth it,positive
As long as the cheater problem keeps as rampant as it is right now I strongly advise against buying this game Meanwhile the developers call the community xenophobes for literally begging to region lock the chinese players while they swim in money Even if you don t know how to deal with them hire someone that does for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s sake being the historically best selling game of Steam I don t believe you don t have the required money to do so  Lazy LOVE LOVE LOVE  developers that  laugh in money   Cheaters every other game that don t even try to hide it  Still full of bugs and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   worth mentioning aswell  Yes I m saltyregionlockchina,negative

This game is the very definition of  greater than the sum of its parts The graphics aren t great the looting and combat are clunky the sound while improved is just good This is the type of game that is never the same twice It creates these fun stories almost every game Whether it s a nailbiter that comes down to a last second charge up a hill into a barrage of gunfire to win the game or a fun ten minute firefight that you lose or getting your motorcycle stuck in a doorway and getting launched into space It s just fun to play,positive

The Best of The WorstPUBG is yet another battle royale game however this one actually works to some degree PUBG is the incredibly simple premise of landing on a huge map finding guns and killing everyone until you re the last one left We have had countless attempts at battle royale before but PUBG is the best one since it actually worksPUBG is not a masterpiece and a  triple A  developer could easily come along and crush it PUBG is flat out the best battle royale game For now,positive

This game is revolutionary It has a massive map where no where is off limits which is pretty much un heard of in a multiplayer game which isn t open world It is great to play with friends or by yourself After playing for a while you might get a bit tired of it but that s more because the game has some stupid mechanics and a lot of small problems which need to be worked out But the big picture is one of a brilliant game the likes of which has never been seen before Fortnite has nothing on it because the map is small and you can t do whatever you want You can drive cars drive boats even drive a car and land it onto a boat You can t do that in fortnite,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PUBG I bought this game so that i could play with my friends and i bought it the day 10 came out and i have had nothing but issues I still cant use my wardrobe or earn bp and now i cant even startup matchmaking because all it tells me is that there was an issue This game is such a steamy pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bluehole doesnt give a flying LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about their customers all they want is money and they will ruin any experience possible just to do it DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,negative
it s PUBG everyone knows what this game offers by nowI think it is worth the price and runs a lot better now than it did when it first was in early accessOverall definitely worth a purchase,positive
PUBG is by far is the best game I have played It seems hard at first it just takes a lot of practice The weapons are great there is real bullet drop and also you will have to lead your shot if a person is moving The servers are great the controls are easy and inventory management is easy also I suggest this game to anyone looking for a challenge and enjoys FPS,positive
This game was the first game i purchased on steam I was expecting an action packed thrilling battle royal game Instead what I got was a boring walking simulater I dont even care about the bugs in the game as they have never really bothered me Its just the gameplay  Note that i have played this game for 30 hours you either drop to a highly populated  zone to have some fun and die immediantly or go to some random place on the map  which is 8 km by 8 km run around for 20 minutes and then get shot by some player with a sniper rifle in the back of the head Game of the year,negative
So I am just shy of hitting 500 hours of this game been playing it for over a year and what can I say about this game  It is extremely fun met my expectations when it first came out but why the concern and do I not recommend this game  Well besides the hackers and other things there is one thing that has become clear and why this game will slowly start to lose traction or until the developers give up on it Lately they ve made some huge changes to try and pump life back into the game Nothing wrong with changing the meta but this is the issue The frame rate drop makes the game unplayable at times and this use to never be an issue for me I saw the comments of people complaining about the game not being optimized but now it has become clear that the game is a mess There are times when I am playing I am running over a 100 frames and then there are times for example during the event mode Desert Knights  I believe is the name where at one point I was down to 9 frames I believe that the pressure of Maverick coming to closed beta soon Call of Duty s Blackout mode coming in the fall and then potentially a Battlefield BR that the devs are starting to feel the pressure of keeping up Right now they are taking risks because they feel they have to or they have the ability because they know that if their players would rather play Fortnite they would have already left  Personally the art style is the only reason why I don t play it over PUBG My recommendation is if you haven t bought this game don t There is more options coming to the market  so save your money and see how PUBG responds because if they don t do something this game will be dead in a years time,negative

I Honestly don t recommend this gamebuying it will be just a waste of good money There is many hackers than you can imagine in any gameplus they didn t even remove the friendly fire which will be so annoying when you play with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  who suddenly shoot at their teammatesyou feel the developers of this game don t even bother themselves to support the game after you buy itit can be addicting game but with the 2 reasons i ve mentioned you will know that you ve lost your money for nothing,negative
Ive played around 170 hours of this game and  i think i got a good and comprehensive view on the game At first its a blast while playing and winning for the first time feels incredible but after some time this game just gets boring and frustrating and thats when you realise how monotone and how bad the quality of this game isPro has the potential to be funny when playing with friendsbest game of the battle royal genreCon  incredibly bad optimization very monotone  2 maps and 4 usual Assault Rifles even though it has the potential to be fun while playing it rarely isIn a nutshell Dont buy it unless they optimized it performance wise and added more maps and weaponsUntil that point i dont recommend it for non NASA PC Users and human beings who get frustrated after looting and killing for 30 minutes to end up getting shotgunnend in the face by a camper or sniped by one of the Million cheaters out there because the Anti Cheat system is them throwing watermelons at a burning jungle to stop the fire,negative

I wholeheartedly hate this whole LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game OK i lie i actually LOVE this game However a game is played one cannot play a game if said game crashes The game was FINE and then they did 3 updates in 1 week each fixing the last to no avail because my game keeps LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  crashing I have looted for 23 mins to crash find my character running in an open field hundreds of meters away from my vehicle to then find a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  VW i have then proceeded to continue the survival spirit while contemplating making this review to my amazement i didn t tip it sadly i ran out of fuel but i did manage to make it to the zone I find the perfect spot for cover so that i can heal myself and continue with the troubled yet epic journey of survival I spot a nearby rock for perfect cover then a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  shoots me and kills me from afar  awdhjfaqwjudfaJIKUYDqwf udAWUKDAwfkiu LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  MY LIFE and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game,negative

This game is full of hackers There needs to be region lock on all servers to stop chinese I cannot and will not reccomend this game,negative
As someone who has played since the Early Access phase pretty much exclusively I cannot reccomend this game anymore I put up with the bugs since release the net code the de sync being awful but even after 800 hours of play time and close to a year of development after release this game is still in an unplayable state If the devs actually nurtured and cared for this game it would be GOTY worthy I don t regret picking the title up I ve had some seriously amazing moments with my friends playing this game but as of late the experience has grown stale Hacking has been a SERIOUS issue for this game you ll see players speed hacking shooting through walls being bulletproof being invisible or just simply firing into the air and getting headshots on players across the map So as you loot for 20 minutes to get your prefered loadout 710 times you ll get killed by a cheater or someone with an awful ping I can t say this enough  DONT BUY THIS TITLEEven Sony won t buy it because of the state of itSave your money boys TriHard 7 out,negative
Great idea in the worst hands to put it in Dont ask them to region lock China ask them to fix and prevent cheating from happening Its not the Chinese fault its the devs Dont buy this until February 2nd and then wait to see if the recent reviews turn positive,negative

Good idea but badly implemented could ve been so much better if this was implemented by a big game company I mean the graphics are crap to say the least yet the game requires a beast of a machine I have many older games on my pc with much better graphics and performance The sound is the worst you are ro relliant on sounds in this game yet the game only has stereo sound which is terrible aswell you can t even sometimes hear when an enemy enters a buklding walks right up to you and opens fire All and all I wouldn t waste my money on this especially since there are alot of free alternatives available which is much better optimised,negative

Look Elsewhere As the gaming industry progresses we are introducted to a new type of genre  Battle Royale PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a great example of a battle royale game you should avoid like the plague Do not be decieved by the high twitch viewer count or its immense popularity throughtout the internet This game is not worth your time nor your money To put it straight this game doesn t deserve it s final release The game is riddled with hackers and is low quality in terms of today s standard Yes the game has lovely looking graphics but it s so poorly optimized to the point where the highest  end top of the line PC s struggle with it The amount of hackers in this game is absurd and Bluehole has done jack LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about it There s not a single thing I can praise Bluehole for since they decided to ruin a perfectly fine game by not caring about it s major flaws They were given a clear solution to hackers  region lock China yet they didn t do it  Why ban an entire region of hackers from playing when we can spread them out  Obivously I m hating on PUBG a little too much The game itself if it were to be optimized would be a joyful experience that s thrilling and fun with friends The problem is there are much better alternatives to PUBG Why spend 30USD when you can play an actual good battle royale such as Fortnite where the company actually cares about the state of their game and is actually  playable  The only reason i d ever say to buy this game is for the crates  You can make quite the killing off of selling crates however the only downside is that you actually have to play the game   ,negative

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS offers a new and fun experience for players and it has served as a fresh reminder that not every competitive game needs to be team based I have easely synced 500 hours into other competitive games such as League of Legends and Overwatch But I can say that the problem with games like those is that they provide a massive frustration  your teammates I can never tell if I am improving in those types of games and though I can often point out a reason for losing in my own play I can t help but feel as if some of it was out of my control PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS eliminates that struggle making it easy to see your improvement and removing frustration in teamplay Though PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS offers team based play It is not nearly as frustrating as other games If someone dies on a squad they just leave and start a new game With the inclusion of solo play when you lose it s nobody s fault but your own Almost forgot to mention that the gun play is fantastic not too easy like COD and not too brutal for newbies like CS GO Leaning also adds a surprising layer of depth that I didn t expect it to add PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is dare I say  fun  You will not regret this purchase,positive

Since the coming of Fortnite I realised that not everything you do in Battle Royal should have a giant lag,negative
I belive that PLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a well developed game that needs polishing  the combat system is fair and the weapons are terribly well balanced  the graphics are outstanding with realistic gun textures but the ground surface looks as though it has been painted on with little effort going towards that area and the grass should be  3D  becuase when a player is to look at the grass it has two faces but no third or fourth face to make it look realistic The game has two large maps with a third one getting trialed and soon coming I belive in several years 1 3  depending on the difficulty of the tasks this game will be almost perfect To have the best experience using a gaming PC is recommended because of how  large  of a game it is Rating  710 would recommend this game,positive
Bought this game during early access during the days where you needed a super computer to run this game because of how unoptimized it was As a whole it was still amazing and fun to play nonetheless The developers did a great job ACTUALLY leaving early access and revamping the game But that was one time Compared to Fornite where the developers actually care about their game and improve it consistently there hasn t been any real improvements with PUBG,negative

This game makes me sad because its potential and room for infinite growth has been stopped dead by the developers lack of concern with the state of the game Playing since the first day of release I have seen this game grow and become a phenomenon however it has become clear that the devs have become out of touch with its players The hacker problem has killed this game for me amognst other things but the devs never seem to outright address the issue instead implementing vague  anti cheat measures  in each new patch which seem to do next to nothing I am hopeful that a region lock feature in the near future will help bring this game back to its prior glory However in its current state I could not recomend this to my friends or others on steam   ,negative

This game is probably one of the worst developed games i have ever played and strongly suggeest that you should wait to purchase this game until they fix all of most of teh bugs and until they regionlock their servers It would be a good game if it was not for the bugs Right now play Fortnite because it is free and it has alot less bugs and hackers It is still pretty fun to play with friends but you will get very annoyed to the stupid bugs and other BS in this game,negative
I have never written a review of a game on STEAM  But I feel that  I should warn anyone wanting to buy this game that i basically threw my money out the window  This game is HACKER CENTRAL   First off the best odds you have is in the beginning when you land on the groundeveryone is even then  But about 5 minutes into the game you see how horrible this game becomes  The hackers dont even have to aim on youjust in your general direction and they hit you all the time  Even driving a vehicle they hit you and not even having the reticle on the vehicle   At the end of each match you can lodge a complaint if you think someone is cheatingI find myself doing it 75  of the timeand it does NOTHING  This could be an awesome game but its notit s u c k s,negative

If you do speak any form of Chinese I cannot reccomend you purchase this gameThe developers of this game have a deaf ear pointed in the direction of their player base The only reason it is any bit as successful as it is has been from Brendan  Playerunknown  Greene and his team The main factor they brought to the table has been their minimally average understanding of what mechanics can make a game enjoyable The issue with this game is the fact that 90  of it s total active players are from China where a copy can be bought for the equivalent of roughly 13 USD All they need to do to completely ruin a few hundred matches is select  NA  on a sliding menu on the bottom of the their title screen and the game does literally nothing to detour this behaviour They destroy the latency of matches They use the disposable level cheap copies they are offered by usin cheating software to ruin matches for other players for weeks on end recieve a ban  buy a new copy and repeat that cycle countless timesRegion lock ChinaBan PC hardware that hackers use and stop repeatedly shilling out this game to hackers at the expense of honest players so you can rake in more cash The greed is so obvious and transparentLastly Region lock ChinaRegion lock China,negative

One of the worst games i have ever played no anti cheat no region locking making squad based combat worthless cus you can t communicateFun idea bad management,negative
I bought this game in Early Access cause of how many of my friends had bought it The first 10 hours were really enjoyable and I was thoroughly enjoying the battle royale concept as I had not played a game like this before Getting kills was exciting or landing in a tight spot and coming out victorious Communicating with your teammates to spot and take down enemies was really funThis excitement quickly faded as within the first 10 hours  more and more annoyances came up Buildings not loading in incredible loading times and gunplay that feels about as responsive as throwing sponges at your enemies  The entire concept and what they did with it lost it s charm when games forced you to hide for 20 minutes to get shot and wait 20 more minutes to get to that point All poor designoptimizations problems aside this is my biggest flaw with the game 5 minutes of every 30 minute game is fun The beginning and the end are usually quite tense  If you re not perpetually falling on an unloaded building but it s not  nearly enough to justify playing itI tried the game again as it was fully released and every single point I made still stands however the new map seems like an improvement Personally I much prefer Fortnite as it has none of these issues and runs a lot better Quick games with barely any loading or filler It also doesn t look like you accidentally put your old xbox360 graphics into the washing machine so that s a plus,negative

Hello i cant really say i enjoy pubg anymore becuse of it s almost impossible to improve after  1000 hours and isn t an esport like csgo but i would recommend it becuse i got 400 hours of fun and enjoyment out of this game before i started getting bored of it I would say if you re gonna buy this game buy it with a friend or two becuse playing solo isn t so fun after a while if you do not have a super competetive mindset And people are talking about chinese players ruining games and griefing just go to european servers there are almost no chinese but there are some russians that dont speak englishJust saying after 700 hours i have not been in team with a single teamkilling chinese the only teamkiller i have been with was eastern european,positive
I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a friend in its current state Yes it was an Early Access Darling but there are glaring truths that must be acknowledged 1 This game is overrun by hacking players Whether it s the use of ESPs Aimbots Instaboosts or a combination of all three or more that I haven t mentioned there is at least one per game in my experience There is little point in trying in the final four when one of those people will win 100  of the time BlueHole has done nothing to address this going so far as to even admit that the majority of the hacking is coming from China Rather than Region Locking the servers BlueHole seems more than content to allow the rampant cheating to continue Their silence on the matter speaks volumes 2 Technical issues Falling through the map Wonky parachute landings Cars and motorcycles achieving orbit All of these things can kill a round for you Hit detection feels absolutely random at times 3 New dependence on microtransactions for Crates Unlocked a new crate  Awesome That ll be 250 for a key to actually access the contents within That s a lot of audacity on BlueHole s part for them to be pushing for this considering the issues in my first two points For the average player this game just isn t fun anymore It s a hacker s paradise though,negative
I d love to recommend this gamebecause with friends it is quite fun  There are glaring CONS though  PROS    Excellent Co op game        many games you can play with friends requires you to  compete  with your own teammates or rage at each other for simple human errorthis game is more fun the more you stick together  Beautiful  concept         the idea of the game is great and with some major server bugs and region fixes it could be 100x better  CONS    Lag        for gameplay 100  reliant on latency  shot placement this is a game breaking flaw  RNG        unless you have multiple monitors and do some hardcore homeworkstudying about spawn rateslocations the chances of having better gear than the final 10 20 people is 1 out of   of players in the game  That being said I have won solo games with literally 0 shots fired  It is frustrating to get  winning  gear  ie lvl2 helm armor pack scar sks consumables but simultaneously find 0 attachments  or ammo for your weapons  get good with ironsights  BUGS OMFG THE BUGS        where do I start   Everything from the very start of the game  parachutinglanding til the very end  hitboxeslag and some wild LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in between  the comedy of drivingthis game is in worse shape than many early access gamesyet they want full price for a  FINISHED PRODUCT   if you ve played at all this idea is laughable  OVERALL    Wait for like an 80  discount AND make sure to have 3 reliable friends to play with  Solo IS fun for a bit but that fun dwindles incredibly fast  or just play Fortnite,negative
Significant issues with framerate even though my system exceeds the minimum  requirement to play,negative
So much fun love this game But the hacking is way to out of hand Can t remember a match in the past few days where a hacker hasn t destroyed me Not a good buy until things are taken care of,negative

There is nothing much to say best game by far,positive
A great concept with fairly good execution if it wasn t for the major issue with cheaters and hacking at the moment this game would definitely have a positive review At this point every other game results in a death from a cheater who s using blatantly obvious cheatshacks There are advertisements to cheats on the official forum that almost never get deleted due to lack of moderationThen there s the issue with TONS of players from China and other Asian regions playing on the North American server because it gives a latency related advantage The way the game works the worse your ping to the server the better you can playWithout some serious redesign of the regional issue and major overhaul in terms of anti cheat this game isn t worth spending any money on at this timeIdeally the Bluehole team will release some way for communities to moderate their own dedicated or authorized servers It seems like the only way to ensure that players aren t cheating while in game,negative
Oddly enough if you play on Asian server there are no chineese hackersSo that s a big plus,positive
I lik it,positive

This is the best battle royale game so far It would be better if developers would make faster the looting process or something like that but they are improving the game all the time so it s just gonna get better,positive

It s sad that a game of this magnitude has so many cheaters The devs just keep adding ways of reporting cheaters rather than actually preventing cheating I would have thought that this issue would have been resolved by launch,negative
Has so much potential Unfortunatly as of writing this the game is completely overrun by hackers In it s early days hacks were not as big of an issue You d be more likey to die to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  physics than come across an aim bot From my own personal experience as of the week I m writing this I ve died to blatantly obvious hacks about 70  of my games I have a few highlights I have saved in game and will clip once I get the motivation to do so This game is incredibly rewarding when you win Combat is exciting and refreshing when it s fair but quite litterally unplayable in its current state I don t agree that region locking Asia will fix this issue although I think it will help in a small short term way The only way I can see myself re installing this game is when the devs bring in an anti cheat Until then this game will stay uninstalled in my  Why did I buy this   catagory next to No Mans Sky Hopes this helps Cheers,negative

Let me start off by saying the game is awesome It s an awesome concept and brings a fresh look at TPP and FPP games With that said the problems with the game aren t really with the game at all It s Brandon Green and Bluehole that are the problem To be even more specific it s their liberal world view which is basically ruining the game First the players from day 1 have been complaining about Chinese players Not that we don t like the Chinese but their pings are absurd The Dsync caused by this is SOOO bad that it makes the game unplayable You can put a full shotgun blast point blank into sosmeone but because they have a 27438686432 ping it won t even register Sounds like a legitimate complaint right  Something a normal dev would look at and be like  Oh maybe they have a point  Not Brandon Green Nah he says we re all xenophobes It s not that the game is broken it s basically because what he refers to as  his community  is just being racist That s how the dev s feel about the people who buy their game If you complain about flaws in their game it s not their fault it s yours for being a racist xenophobe The other obvious issue with having large amount of chinese players playng on the North American server is the breakdown in communication If they could speak English or I could speak chinese it wouldn t be a problem Trying telling someone who doesn t speak your language that someone is entering the house they re in Not so easy But of course this again isn t a legitimate complaint i m apparently just being racist So thats really what you should be prepared for A fun game thats broken because the people who should take care of simple issues would rather call the people who spend money on their products racists and xenophobes Don t worry though our complaints have recently been heard Instead of fixing the game they gave us micro transactions Just what they claimed everyone wanted Nobody wanted a functional game according to them we wanted to spend more money on a broken gameThis is the typ of experience you can expect It s like a super talented up and coming sports star who gets busted with 100 kilos of coke A waste,negative

Let me tell first of all that I like this game and what I am about to say next comes from a place of love and apreciation for the game  THIS GAME SUCKS In other words this concept is great and playing solo or with friends is extremelly fun but at the same time stressfull and frustrating It s extremely rewarding to win a round but the amount of  work  you have to put into it is not for everyoneNow my main objections with the game are on a technical spectrum It lacks basic features like a map selector or some way to check your ping for instance It also feels very clunky at times during gameplay specially if there are a larger number of palyers than normal nearby and this can be easilly witnessed in early game to which can affect your performance during the game and you experience as wellGranted that they are working in improving these aspects and many more and I have seen their work improving but to launch this game and have it at ver 10 without some basic functionalities and at the same time having lootboxes where you have to buy a 250 dollar key to open each one is just a slap in the face of everyone that supported this game and paid for it early access This game still has potential and a lot of room to improve and I seriously hope that Bluehole does not fall like H1Z1 because as I said before I love this game and I hope to be playing it for a very long time but if you still haven t bought it wait a little while longer so it improves and be actually worth the 30,negative

I have played this game for 31 hours and my experience has been Shakey To say the least The concept of this game is really awesome when you describethink about it I mean c mon 100 players on one map Depth within gunplay Exciting RNG aspects making every game different Possibility for crazy battlesAll of that may sound good but when you actually play the game what you are left with is a mediocre game AT BESTAllow me to explainThe goal of the game is to survive against the other players in the match which you do by looting for guns and supplies throughout the map s playable area which shrinks overtime till the match is over Now that sounds like fun but when you actually play it it can be boring frustrating mind numbing and tedious Let s say you land in a school where there are tons of guns health items and more Everyone drops there so the fighting is going to be do or die There is a initial scramble to grab a gun a sense of chaos and fear which turns into a complete warzone This is about as much fun as you will ever get out of this gameLanding in some place where there are people and having fun looking for weapons while also being in danger of being killedJust about everything past this point is absolutely boring until the end of the game where the playable area is so small that fights break out all over and it is do or die yet again However this ALSO gets back to being boring when there is only a few people left and it s basically a game of who can out wait the other person s patience Now that doesn t sound like such a bad experience it has flaws but also has fun moments that are paced in such a way that people can get addicted to In fact I would say I would enjoy this game even with those flawsbuuuuut The netcode at the start of the round is about 5 ticks per second and for those who don t know what netcode is I highly suggest you go watch some videos from battle nonsense as he breaks things down in a very digestible fashion Anyways back to the netcode With the netcode being 5 ticks at the start of the round the game is like playing battlefield on dial up The game rubberbands you consistently doesn t allow you to pick up weapons sometimes and you will die behind corners often Please remember I said it was 5 ticks at the start of the match which means that you basically have the least amount of control in the fastest part of the match Which pretty much ruins the fun when you think about how a lot of kills and deaths you got were pretty much not your fault or you didn t deserve considering the other playerI really don t see how battlefield 4 had a 10 tick netcode and got SLAMMED with criticism and refunds and before battlefront 2 s controversy went down as being one of the biggest EA DICE screw ups EVER but then this game gets 20 million players and no one gives a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I mean yeah the reviews are mixed but the player count twitch viewers and other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  surrounding the game is still going strong And this game has half the netcode that battlefield 4 had on release AND this game has microtransactions AND only has 2 maps AND is 30 bucks I mean come the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on Had this game been made by a bigger studio this would have been regarded universally as a bad game Not a good game not an ok game not a meh game a BAD game Anyways back to the review So reading this you may think to yourself  why not land in a place where nobody lands   Well landing in a place where nobody lands basically makes your match 95  running driving and getting shot at by people who you can t see This obviously is not very fun If you do happen to get the drop on someone in this stage of gameplay you ll probably kill them with little retaliation Which is still not very fun And if you do get into a place where there is action most of it will be shooting at little dots in the distance while they shoot back or more than likely run away Which isn t very fun you seeing the pattern here So to recap  Netcode sucks causing fun parts of the game to suck Gameplay isn t very fun for most of the match When there is fun to be had some other aspect of the game usually ruins it So how would I make this game good Well for starters cut the map size in half This in turn will speed the game up a lot and to compensate for this make the maps more densely packed with cover so gunfights are more interesting Make sure lower tier guns are easier to find the smaller map will make combat instant so players will need to be able to find a pistol or something easily Higher tier weapons still should be rare and very helpful to winning the game Higher tier weapons should also be found in densely packed cities where there are a lot of players making a better risk vs reward system Which to the game s credit it does have on its first map Balance the rest of the game around the smaller map change vehicle speed armor spawn rates ammo spawns etcAnd work on the netcode I don t have much to say but just work on it Hell if you can get the netcode working that alone will make the game more fun Granted sadly the game is held back by being on an engine that doesn t handle this many players easily so this might be an issue that will take a long time to fix Final statement   Twitch maybe able to carry this game for now but for how long  PlayerUnknown and his team of devs need to start looking towards the future for their game rather than trying to preserve the present by calling out other battle royale games PUBG is on the top right now but if you look onto the horizon fortnite is catching up at a VERY fast rate islands of nye will soon be in beta giving players a PUBG like game but with better netcode and there is more on the way trust me there s no doubt in my mind that battle royale has a good chance of being in the next battlefield game and I am sure that there is even tougher competition than that on its way Whatever you do Brenden don t get cocky cause you certainly aren t out

Fun game but its way too frustrating to enjoy People need to play on their own servers Not just China EVERYONE needs to stick to their own servers Game has a large enough player base to lock people to their regions but developers probably too busy swimming in cash to do something about it It s not just the cheats either How would you like it if you ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE you shot somebody but the game doesn t register it because someone playing from another country has such high ping that the game doesn t even think that they are where they are Want to play a battle royale  Please save yourself the trouble and play Fortnite instead Its got its own set of problems but at the very least its free  and less frustratingDo not buy Treat yourself to a nice meal instead You deserve better,negative

This game is full of hackers and a clueless dev team who have no actually plans for the game They deliver patches that are 1 step forward and 5 steps off a cliff  Example  They fix lag in pre game lobby but end up causing games to constantly crash The dev team claims that pubg is an  evolving product and doesn t have a clear roadmap for the future  For a game out of beta I would expect moreEvery game now seems to have at least one hacker who will see through terrain have and aim bot or have guns with hacked stats The game mode is fun but it is not in a fair playable state It has potential but for 30 I would wait untill the game becomes more stable,negative
i love this game fantastic game aside from the coding  thius is the only game i have played that will crash regurlarly out of early access this should not of been released asa  complete game  untill these this were resolved such as crashing crashing and crashing this has nothing to do with my system but this has all to do with the system that pubg has created because of this i cannot recommend this game untill blue hole can resolve the issues and provide a FULL GAME,negative

PUBG as many people have said has so much potential but what it has in potential it lacks in execution First off PUBG has a huge amount of hackers  their anti cheat software is as good as nonexistent Just to put into perspective how many hackers there actually are I would say between 60 and 80  of my deaths have been due to hackers I don t mean to be racist when I say this but most if not all hackers I have seen in the game have been Chinese Everybody knows this yet they refuse to land lock China With that huge influx of Chinese people there comes another problem  communication I am assuming that most people reading this are not Chinese as it seems like every Chinese person in existence owns this game At least half of my teammates in squads have been Chinese people who not only speak very little  they sometimes say things like  China numba wun  or  you no good you bad  if any English but they also just seem to micspam This makes it very difficult to play a game as I have to mute the mic mid game,negative
not that great,negative
This game had everything to continue being a great game but by the negligence of the produdotora by the players this game will end up being infestation 2 It is difficult for you to play a match without finding with hackers We denounce it and see nothing happen I do not recommend this game to anyone,negative
I can t stop playing even though I can t shoot worth a damn,positive
I love this game so much But for the last 6 months 910 games you play you ll die to someone with an aimbot or my personal favorite someone who just fists your LOVE LOVE LOVE  with a shotgun from 1800 yards across three mountains and a city It literally makes me sad because I feel like I am getting worse at the game but in reality it s just that there are more hackers Extremely disappointing,negative
China sucks yo,negative
The game runs like trash the gun mechanics just make shooting not fun and maybe worst of all is that its just boring Most games will have you fall to the map just to wander towards a circle for 20 minutes just to die from someone you never saw Honestly I regret buying this game,negative
It s awesome Don t let the reviews fool you,positive

The concept of this game is amazing and fun however the amount of cheating and all round LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor optimization will have you struggling to stop yourself from putting your fist through the screen And for a little while it was actually fun and the cheating seemed to go down but everytime the devs push a bigger update the cheating multiples by 10 and becomes almost unplayable Most games you can make it to the top 10 then get killed by some prick using aimbot or some form of ESPwall hack Possibly the worst part is the daily 25 to 26MB update that is supposedly anti cheat updates yet the game is plagued by cheating The servers are full of desynch and bugs and fps drops IF the devs would put more effort into optimizing the gameplay instead of stupid visual crates it would be a good game at this point save your money and wait for Battlefield 5 to drop,negative
Its a really fun game especially if you play with your friends I recommend it to those who just wanna have fun and doesnt care about rankings,positive
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BATTLE ROYALE  PLAY FORTNITEPUBG Isn t worth your money nor is it worth your timeEvery single time you play duos and squads you usually have to ask  Do you speak English  before you ask  Do you have a mic  because of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing amount of Chinese players that are on this game Other than that the game is okay I don t see why you would play PUBG over Fortnite though since Fortnite is more polished,negative

If you look for an action game this is not the game for youIf you look for a game of sneaking and hiding this is the game for youThe only action is when you survive until there are only 10 players leftthen the action may beginAnd its not much of an action cause one shot can end a game where most of it you were silent and hiding just to reach the endPersonally i dont like it and i dont understand what was all the fuss around itI prefer a game of much more action and shooting then being silent and trying to hide,negative

I personally don t find this game enjoyable I find that you get shot out of some person going prone and you can t see them until you view where they are on the deathcamI personally don t like this game but you may enjoy itI would prefer Fortnite over this due to the more action and more shooting and you have battles where you and the player mostly see eachother,negative
I would recommend this game quite frankly I adore it for many reasons The game is constantly expanding and the games are engaging and fun Here are my divided advantages to disadvantages Advantages The large variety of weapons and attachments allows the player to choose which weapon to use depending on their preference and what for instance grips they prefer or scopes they prefer on which weapons  The combat and bullet timedrop system is great and is unique to each gun so its not just a copy and paste on each weapon  The maps are brilliant there are 2 currently and a third in development and provide us users with different combat situations  Miramar is the best map because it has the win94  The use of vehicles is amazing and thoroughly enjoy using them attacking them The graphics are simply phenomenal if you haveare getting this game and can run it on max just go first person and look at the detail on the guns its amazing I ve seen plenty of complaints about the FPS i haven t got an issue with them but I d say make sure your computer is good enough to run it so you won t encounter these problemsDisadvantages  Vehicles are buggy Although I said they are great fun they can be very infuriating when they glitch and break For instance I recently had a game where my car got stuck on its back and hopped damaging the vehicle eventually killing it and me I was not impressed  The game can crash I won t tag on  often  because its only happened to me 3 times and I ve had it for some time but the crashes are undoubtedly thereIn conclusion I would definately recommend this game IF you have a good computer to run it on,positive
The game is great and the devs are eager to release updates which keeps the game alive great work devs,positive

The moment you land in a  hot zone  the netcode starts lagging a lot which hinders your ability to loot quicklyThis game does not treat new players well as there is no  training grounds  to work on your aim There are temporary events such as a team deathmatch with 10 teams of 5 fighting in a small fixed circle the FPS will lag with these high density of playersDuring firefights  mostly close quarters your FPS will drop which ruins your aimMost of these bugs take place in early game and it smoothens out later  If you survive that long,positive

This game is complegte trash from players to actual gameplay FPS delay at the worst times causeing lagg spikes for un rendered parts of the  map especially beginign of the game the aiming system seems off by a long shot just in my opinion Aiming in just feels sketchy Delays of enemy gun fire are like the begining days of battlefield 4 run behind cover and then take all those shots damage It seems you will always have hackers in the game pulling some bs on you and in addition to that you have the whole chinese community comming on us servers just talking crap and offering no help in duos or squads,negative

PUBG is a fun game No doubt This review is more of a warning about their support team  Who as far as I can tell are a pack of mentally handicapped lemurs They do very little to fix the problem this game has with hackers and have banned 100s of accounts in error Some people have managed to restore their accounts many others have been told to pound sand They will not give you any information on any accused infractions They will simply lock your account and claim they do not do  retests on bans as it is done internally If you ARE a hackercheater Your ban is permanent So good riddence  If you are the victim of hacking or cheatingYour ban is permanent So qq They will take your money and send their support team to kick you in the balls over and over and over and over while exclaiming the whole while how frustrating this must be for you Cannot recommend as there is a reasonable chance you will be banned for no reason or for being the victim of a hacker  Chinese or otherwiseEDIT  Blueholes  appeal  system does not exist Their support staff are not actually trained to help you and won t actually respond directly to any questions or requests  This is one of the GREASIEST companies I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with I am sure they have modelled their business  code of ethics to resemble that of EA because both carry the same stench of cheap whiskey and hot garbage on a summers day in LA Do not believe a word that drips from their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  encrusted lips They are doing absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all to actually protect their player base They are sure to get a couple legitmate hackers no doubt  However their policy of ban first and never ask questions is appalling  even if it is not totally illegal You will not be asked to provide any proof because you are guilty They will not accept any proof you provide shy of capturing the actual perps and bringing them to Blueholes offices alive  They will  take your money ban you when you are hacked by one of the people they failed to protect you from then ghost you faster than that girl you  really had a connection with  from tinder did last month Play the game Or go play fortnite  They are both fun as hell Just know you are really rolling the dice with these idiots,negative

Hello over the past few weeks I ve seen large numbers of forum members here and other platforms voicing their legitimate concerns over the vast numbers of Chinese players taming over the NA servers and I wanted to offer you all some suggestions that may alleviate this growing issue There are several reasons that they are a problem which I will list below 1 This is a voice chat communication game Americans and Canadians select this server to understand their teammates When you join a squad or duo and the other person cannot speak English it causes gameplay issues 2 The majority of cheaters are Chinese and the best anticheat solution is to region lock the servers This will reduce the cheaters greatly 3 Chinese Nationalism is an issue here No other citizen I can think of from any nation comes into this game screaming  Insert you country here is number one and this is also an issue because most of the time if you are paired with 3 other Chinese people don t expect help from them or possibly risk being team killed because your not one of them  Yeah Brendon Greene were the xenophobes ok I remember when I first got this game and I didn t know it put me on the AS server and I was the only American in my squad Next match I selected the NA server where I belong and I was squared with 3 more Asians I thought to myself I can t tell the difference in the servers,negative

BEST GAME EVER,positive
Pros  Attractive map design lovely buildings with comfortable furnishings and meticulous attention to detail Coming from ArmA where buildings are completely empty this is something worth mentioning Decent game physics  movement car handling bullet drop  A good variety of weapons One of the rare military games where you can also play as a womanCons  The outcome of the game is mostly determined by luck In the early stage it is by pure chance whether someone ends up with a decent weapon first Similarly in the last stages luck decides whether you or your opponents must leave cover first before getting wiped out in the open field If you go for highly populated areas you must be lucky to find a gun first If you go for abandoned places you will run for 20 minutes until you finally receive a lucky headshot while you bandage yourself under the first tree within the circle The killer is glad to receive a myriad of ammunition and a factory fresh rifle where no bullet ever has left the barrel Unfortunately the game is being ruined by hackers who excessively use instant healing and aimbot  Both available maps are bare and have scant vegetation offering little opportunities to find cover  The game incentivizes camping and disincentivizes engagement  A general remark on the game mode  One or two players often end up spectating their teammates for 10 20 minutes if they get killed in an early stage Clearly this is somewhat frustrating compared to other game modes where a respawn is possible Since I am frustrated more often than I am contented I cannot really recommend the game at this point of time,negative

Absolutely Disappointing form Blue Hole and PUBG Corp for putting out one of the worst battle royale games that I ve ever played Takes too long for a match to begin hacks bugs and many more You need to buy keys in order to unlock your chest that you buy in game On top of that there are so many people in one area of the map where you jump out of Guns are even difficult to find  exceptions for handguns Also suing another company that made a better battle royale game  Are you that stupid  Maybe instead of investing to sue another company maybe you should invest on making the game better and bring it to more than just the PC and xbox1 Fortnite is gonna be the first battle royale game that is on going to be on multiple platforms  Ps4xb1PC Mobile and soon Nintendo Switch Overall I would never recommend this to anyone especially when a company that wants to sue everyone because they re the first people to made a battle royale game  news flash  You re not the first who created battle royale,negative

This game used to be amazing one of my top played games and I m not much of a shooter kind of person Ever since the chinese flooded NA servers its been ridiculous They are either hacking or super laggy or both it is incredibly frustrating How about instead of just banning waves of hackers you actually do something to stop the hacks in the first place because this is not working I have stopped recommending this game to people,negative
this game is fantastic,positive
If you enjoy fundamentally problematic alpha state games that are for some reason released as finished products and sold for 23 of a triple A game s price this game is right up your alley The game is similar to communism in a way that the ideas of both might sound neat for SOME people at first until they actually experience it in reality,positive
Cannot tolerate all the cheaters in this game anymore Cheating is way too prevalent,negative

Really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game just ban me with no reason,negative
I can not genuinely recommend this game and here is whyThe game has a lot of flaws1 Buggy still feels like alpha but they claim it is fully released2 Hit detection is horrible I d ran into far too many scenarios where bullets don t register or feel super wonky3 RNG based shooters feels really really unrewarding the majority of my deaths are simply because the enemy found a weapon first after landing You spend your time in lobby pre game airplane parachuting and then looting just to die to something RNG based The mid game is horrendously slow you have this rng based first couple minutes4 Boring mid game after everyone in your town as died out to the last surviving teamplayer you have a horribly long wait till any more action this part is roaming and looting hoping for some rng based goodies to come your way5 Squads can be a huge joke because if one of your squad mates dies early they have to wait forever until the game is over and what they do get to watch is just endless looting until the rare occasion you see someone 6 There is a horrendous balance of downtime to action in a game you often spend 90  or more of your time not actually fighting it s usually looting and looking for more loot The fights themselves about 75  of the time are very unrewarding fights because typically it feels like whoever won the fight had better RNG based loot or got to a building and camped it before you got there I don t mind camping in shooters but when you have so much downtime and so many deaths come from campers it gets boring7 Unrewarding gameplay for the first part of the game i often feel all of my kills are not even earned it s simply because I found a weapon first or found the better weapongear Other times it s because I spotted the enemy first and picked them off before they had an opportunity to shoot at me the rar eoccasion where it is a fair and even gun fight does feel pretty good but even then with horrible hit detection there are times where bullets dont register or bullets do register but in weird ways like after one player has already got behind a wall for cover and the bulelt registers late because the tick rate on PUBG is very bad8 Beginning loot is laggy when you first land you usually have to spam the f button about 20 times to pick up a gun and some ammo it just feels super LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because you land with tons of other players and sometimes you could be right beside someone and ur spamming f to pick up a weapon while they are reloading their gun the game doesn t even give you an opportunity to fight sometimes9 Cheaters are an issue and actually a big issue Typically in games I find ther eisnt a big issue with cheaters there may be the odd one you spot but often it s not enough to ruin the game This game has a lot of cheats and they are easy to get they also sometimes seem hard to spot there is a no recoil hack a program that shows everyone on the map auto aimaimbot speed hack and more The problem is some of these may go undetected because you get picked off and think you just genuinely lost the fight and then when you look at the death cam you see they have no recoil or that their aim suspiciously snapped to your head I ve ran into more cheaters on this game within a bit over 100 hrs than i ve ran into cheaters on league of legends with over 2000 hrs10 Community it s just toxic and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with how much downtime and the unrewarding system put in place you just find tons of people salty and unwilling to care or try You typically only ever want to play with people you knowThe only reason I m still playing this is because I don t have a lot of FPS games atm and I m waiting for Hunt  Showdown to come out so I wanted something to practice my FPS skills It s also nice to just sell every crate I get because it adds up and I ve already bought a game with the money earned so that s pretty much all I m doing is trying to earn the money from the crates in this game to afford Hunt  Showdown If you guys are looking for some fair gun fights and enjoyable gameplay I d keep your eye on Hunt  Showdown This game is going to eventually die out if the devs don t pull their heads out of their ases,negative
paying for keys now and no maps selection  This game is good but until they fix those issues my rating will remain,negative

This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing peace of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because the game have Battle Eye Launcher and Battle eye launcher is bugged and glitched,negative
This game has a price tag that is for some people a turn away And for me the price turned me away Yet my friend persuaded me to get it and it was a wonderous game to behold Coming from games like CSGO other first person shootrs the third person view is really intuative for all the games bugs and glitches the actual gameplay is on another level abosulely mesmersing map size the tense moments when you are going one on one with another man for that chicken dinner and prevailing is an amazing experience I highly recommend this game for everyone as the small price tag is easily outweighed by the hours of fun from this game,positive
whay i bought this game always i see   server is too busy  later   wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyy,negative
Great game great graphics and running all on Ultra got no freezes at all I really want to rate the game positively and I will but not before you guys would solve the cheaters problem Looks like most of them are there just to get crates and sell it through steam or smth perhaps should you just get the possibility to sell it out   a lot will definitely stop ruining other people fun For now it s unplayable really 10 matches 10 times got killed by a guy aiming from AKM using ironsight from a distance of 100m  hitting 1m behind me and still headshotting mePS an update 2 months later  cheaters problem still on Update  much better now with the cheater situation i change itt to positive,positive
This game is honestly a really good game how its pvp based and intense in some situtations There are a few things I hate Like annoying updates joining oceania servers and getting all these asians that cant speak english cheaters and under maintence for 3 hours But its a great game and is better then fortnite because its more realistic,positive
i love this game but too many cheaters in this gamei hope admin will ban they from this game pleasethe cheaters already make this game bad for us,positive
ManWell ive done 94 hours of living dying and winning and tbh i didnt like most of it Firstly the teamkillers are out of hand  i have died at least 20 times by teammates and im just sick of it  Please do something about it Yes it can be a good game but if it wasnt for the streamers it would be nothn just cmon  PUBG stop making the  streamers  feel comfortable and actually fix some problems,negative

An awesome game which is a lot of fun to play especially when playing with your friends Unfortunately i m unable to recommend it at this time since it is infested with cheaters  They ve banned more than 15 million recently and you can expect to be killed by someone who is walling and aimbotting approximately every second game No recommendation at this point but i play to revisit this game with my friends as soon as the hype dies down or they are able to implement a proper anti cheat system,negative
why i always crash _,negative

Okay I ve been waiting for PUBG to fix their problems but the game is still unoptimized and filled with chinese hackers I get above 60FPS and the game feels like you are playing on 20FPS Like I use to have a bit of fun on this game before the abundance of hackers who literally will headshot you as soon as you leave the plane They seriously dont hide the fact that they are hacking PUBG releases updates that only break the game more with constant lag spikes glitched cars that will blow up as soon as you get in them the entirety of the parachute system is nothing less then cancer The devs are not fixing this game But fixing the game doesnt matter if you can throw out an update with more cosmetic items Cosmetic items are good but why cant we get what we are asking for better optimization less glitchesbugs region locking China seriously the usual NA server contains about 60 percent of hackers or atleast people with crazy pings Oh and dont watch the killcams they are completely off  people shooting through walls etc etc So in conclusion i cannot advise anyone to buy this broken game in its current state Hope this helps anyone thinking about buying,negative

Servers are usually bad not a finished game for many reasons was fun when it first released on early access Also like VR the concept is kinda cool but technology just isn t goodadvanced enough for it to be any good Wait until someone copies their concept and makes a real game,negative
I will no longer update this review 432018This game will frustrate you a lot because it s a mini grind to win every time Losing your progress to a bug or bad hitreg can feel really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  after all the kills and looting It feels as if all your time went to waste and you don t always need to be killed by these to be mad Sometimes spawning in and dying to somebody who hapened to find an assault rifle faster time and time again can make you as mad you will experience this a lot Winning feels amazing 100 people and you were the bestI ve always updated this review negative to positive to negative because the bad games feel more meaningfull and impactfull You will have fun playing this game and you will want to completely quit It s the most abusive relationship iv e ever had with a game and I think a lot of people can agree The mixed reviews are people just complaining about a bad game because it feels more impactfull like iv e saidFIX THESE Regional lock on china  not a problem in EUInvisible wallsHitreg and ping even with my 60MBPS internet speedSome guns are so fun to play but are too weak  Mini14 and VSSCars and motorbikes flipping on smooth roads if you are pingingHEALING ITEMS SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY STOP IF I AM PRONE AND I MOVEPROS   Amazing hitboxes  SO much fun  Amazing rewards  You can make money back from the game  15 euro so far for me  Kills feel great  Good fun with friendsCONS   Bugs  Doesn t feel good to die to bugs  Cars are fun but wonky  I feel as if devs don t try hard enough  Hitreg is sometimes off point1010   Stupidly great,positive
I like the game because I enjoy playing with my friends I HATE this game because they are too many hackers cheaters bugs That sums up my review,negative
I like the idea of this game but I hate this game and the fact that it is supposedly a releasedproduction quality product It isn t It is an early access quality productGood The end of the game is excitingBad Servers lag at the beginning of the game Lots of bugs  ex shooting the ground or a window when you re aiming above it Lots of bugs  ex doors glitch if you open and close them too quickly Lots of bugs  ex textures don t load Lots of bugs  ex you fall through the earth Lots hackers Doesn t run well even on mid high end rigs,negative

I just can t recommend this game to anyone The game itself is a buggy mess It crashes constantly people often dc for no reason being shot through walls is a frequent occurence and the death cam is almost as bad as Leagues death report With the gameplay they actually managed to put together a decent formula for a battle royale game with the pressure of the circle gradually forcing teams together but it s also exceedingly rng Finding absoutely no weapons is distressingly common and melee is essentially worthless Somtimes you just find yourself on the other side of the map from the circle with absolutely no cars in sight Speaking of the maps I hope you enjoy long sightlines and open fields because that is 70  of the maps The circle rarely if ever converges on somewhere other than a hill or open field and the only time you ll end up in close quarters combat is at the beginning or when you rarely get storm a house Personally I also think that aside from just being boring in appearance the ui also sucks When I m trying to loot I find constantly that items I click on just aren t picked up for some reason There is no indication at all of how much inventory space you have and the message that tells you its full is at the bottom of the screen and difficult to noticeLastly you can obtain cosmetics randomly from crates bought with BP which is earned  slowly through playing match es and killing players They cost 700 bp for the first crate but then increasingly more and only 7 can be bought a week Each crate contains 1 item and you have a snowballs chance in hell of ever getting somthing other than the bog standard  t shirts and sneakers that are common in the crates as anything more visually interesting is depressingly rare In addtion in a recent update a new crate was introduced that requires a 250 key to open This crate has an 40   chance of appearing and if you re like me and refuse to spend more money on a game I already paided for good luck ever getting any real cosmetic items I feel no urge to ever play this as a result unless its with friends as grinding for cosmetics might as well be pointless I regret buying this game I still enjoy it with friends but it is not worth 30,negative
I cannot seriously tell you enough DONT BUY THIS GAMEThe absolute biggest problem is bluehole refuses to region lock the game so nothing like playing a squad or duo mode and getting mowed down by xiaolang23 with the ping higher than snoop dog on 42018 and not to mention the hackers such as aim lockage or just completely shooting in another direction yet hitting you because on their screen their shooting at you but because their ping is so high you cant even see them yet  Players  Which one of ya s dont know how to region lock ya game from the chinese Bluehole  It wasnt mePlayers  WELL IT WAS ONE OF YA S DISGUSTING,negative
PLAYERUNKOWN S CHEATINGROUNDSLoved the concept but this game is trash in execution  Between the rampant cheating and terrible core server framework save yourself the frustration and just avoid it,negative

This game is riddled with hackers Watching my deathcams I see other players immediately snap their sights onto me and shoot without recoil If it s not a aimhack that I encounter it s someone running as fast as the vehicle I m in This game is bare bones as it is  the developers have made their money and therefore have no insentive to improve the game Fix this broken trash,negative

                                    this is getting out of hand The devs said they didnt want to  ban  a whole country because of a few bad eggs    all im seeing are hackers almost every game now you dont have to ban a country from the game just region lock the servers so they cant join others I mean come on look at home H1Z1 failed because  BattleEye  was supposed to catch all these hackers this game is destin to fail if you dont do something about this listen to your american fans,negative

1077 Hours and Counting so this is not my first rodeo when it comes to this game Been here since the onset and absolutley loved the game but since 10 the Chinese hackers have just taken over all the servers Its truly sad as this game has so much potential but until the developers actually listen to the community rather than simply playing lip service to us we the very individuals who made them who they are and provided them with their newly found success and wealth I can not recommend this game Region and ping lock please it is not racist or xenophobic it is simply the right thing to do and the developers know it Breaks my heart,negative

Absolutely horrible The game only get me 20 fps on a mid end pc while All newest games run smoothe on ultraUncountable bugs random crashes ingame lag and physics where cars randomly flip resulting in death and a wasted 20min spent invested playing a round in the laggy game The idea is very good But this game as it is now runs like complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
This is probably the most entertaining nerve racking action packed game I ve played in a long time Better than Fortnite better than H1Z1 consistent playerbase and all The only downside to this game is that you can only understand half the people in every lobby because all the Chinese players for some reason join the North American servers This really defeats the purpose of the duo and squad gametypes because half the time I get a partner that doesn t even speak English which defeats the purpose of playing duo overall Please put region locks in place and the game will make more sense for everyone,positive

As an avid player of hardcore survival shooters I have logged a lot of hours in this staple battle royal game  The gameplay is challenging and the amount of shootout scenarios one might find themselves in is pretty much endless However I am not recomending this game due to the amount of rage inducing cheating that occurs in the online matches Please fix it bluehole Im sick of reporting cheaters without any indication that the problem is being resolved,negative
Such a broken piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  boring LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Spent so long trying to get the game to work through the dozens of server problems and file errors I encountered that I couldn t refund it due to the hours I got completely scammed and furthermore whenever I try to complain about it I m told to shush because  it was made by a small team what do you expect   I expect a functional LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game for the price of 30 How dare they have the audacity to put an absolute broken piece of garbage for sale Never played Fortnite but apparently it s this game s competition so please go download that,negative

This game is full of cheaters and this problem is always not be addressed I m ranked 2000 both in NA and EU Every game I repeat every game I played I met cheaters and got killed I know cheating is hard to solve but I ve ever played a game that takes so long to fix and there are still so many cheaters and countless brutal cheating methods Now I strongly recommande not to buy this game until the problem of massive cheating solved Because if you buy it you are totally wasting your time may be with addiction and you ll be killed after your efforts to survive after 20 minutes then got nothing but anger and disappointment Pls do not buy this and let Bluehole know if they don t fix the problem as soon as possible they will have an outflow of old players LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOU CHEATERS UR MOMS EXPLODE RIGHT AWAT,negative

Plays game for 1257 hours gets banned for landing a headshot GG don t buy this game and do not support this developer  I m going to play fortnite it is free and doesn t ban its players for fun   UPDATE   After sending tickets to both Battleye and Bluehole I did actually get unbanned  While this is comforting that they are willing to discover that innocent players do not deserve bans it is very frustrating that I was locked out of a game I enjoy simply because of what seems to be terrible netcode Maybe I am wrong about that but it is just my assumption  I will continue to play the game because the core gameplay is pretty fun but this honestly killed alot of the love I had for it,negative

Time for an honest reviewFirst and foremost  do yourself a favor and mute all chat other than team chat There is literally nothing of value to be gained from listening to the public chatNow that that s settled let s tackle the gameplay Is it fun  YES It s like Battle Royale meets Hunger Games You and up to 98 others get dropped onto an island with nothing and have to fight to find weapons and gear to survive But can the gameplay be improved  Absolutely There are definitely lag issues and for a 30 game one would expect more from the servers That said I think the whole  the Chinese are ruining everything  outcry is a bunch of whiny bull Look at my hours played I m on 29 hours as  of this review and I m a top 23  player on Third Person Solo You can find ways to do well like say NOT running around shooting everything that moves  You get much better ranking for survival than you do for killing others so it pays to remain unnoticedAnyway enough of that Can the graphics be improved  Absolutely Does it suck to get killed before you even know which direction you re being fired upon from  Absolutely Are the physics a bit wonky  Yes But even with all of its flaws the game is still fun especially when playing duo with a partner It s not for everyone but if you can overlook a few flaws the fun more than makes up for it,positive

Playing this game with friends is funPlaying with a random is also fun until you get paterned with someone who doesnt talk or just doesnt know you re language that wellPlaying Solo is also fun until you run into hackers who headshot you when you re top 10 which ruins the funIt s fun for the most part but alot of forigners play on the NA server and i dont mind overall but most dont know English so calling out or just talking in gernaral seems kind of null and the hackers you run into 35 games just ruin it for you610,negative

Get ready to suck at a game like no otherthis game is absolutelybrutally honest in a way that is fun40  of gameplay is being shot at by a sniper from go knows whereThe rest running and scraping a handful of kills togetherThe concept and controls are well constructed optimisations is okay And combat feels smooth Although custom keybindings are recommended Beyond what other salty players would persist this game is great little to no bugs other than the cars occasionally flipping and spazzing this game brings new and exciting ways to die and or succeed in combat that is Adrenalin inducing TO THE MAXOutfits and character customisation is quirky and the best aspect is the ability to make decent amounts of money off this game marketing crates for dough on the steam marketIf FPS non canonical pvp games are your whiz I highly recommend this game,positive
Although this game is fun to play and looks nice I would recommend AGAINST buying it untill these f k head developers do something about the massive amounts of hackers EVERY single game I play I seemed to get killed by someone who randomly swings around for no reason and headshots me This causing significant loss on my ratingsBAN THE F KING HACKERS BEFORE THEY ALONE BOMB THIS GAME,negative

I totally support region lock on China even if I am a Chinese living in AmericaFirst of all those Chinese who cannot speak good English are literally embarassing this game when they set their feet on NA and other servers to play duo and squad with random match I don t even understand why they do this when they can t even communicateSecondly hackers from China just want to lead the leaderboards of every server I even teamed with one when playing duo  even if I only played several hours after 10 and when there were about 20 people left that guy literally just shut down evryone out of nowhere with a S1897,negative
If you speak chinese and english I have some good news for you You should be able to play this game as long as you can stand getting shot through walls On the other hand If you don t speak chinese and don t like being shot through your cover Good luck If you complain you are a xenophobe and a racist HOW DARE YOU NOW WANT TO GET SHOT THROUGH WALLS  HOW COULD YOU NOT ENJOY TAKING DAMAGE FROM DEAD PEOPLE  HACKING IS SOCIALLY ACCEPTED IN CHINA SO YOU BETTER BE READY TO SEE PEOPLE RUNNING FASTER THAN ANY CAR CAN GO Hope you like the fact that you cant be shot through water Or maybe you are a minecraft god who loves seeing floating LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trees BUY SOME DESPACITO CRATES WEAPON SKINS COMING SOON,negative

Arguably the best and most straightforward Battle Royale game on the market  Fortnite is a bit too zany for me PUBG is a game that is littered with strange  but not absurd physics Asian hackers bad RNG and clunky mechanics Despite those things the basic gameplay and tension created in moments of combat manages to keep this game afloat Personally I find it really fun It s irritating and garbage at times but that s part of its personality I rate this game CoryZero it s a pretty decent anime trying to find its place among lower quality garbage shows like DayZ At least it s out of Early AccessOh and                                         ,positive
I really enjoy playing this game its one of the bestwhen it bloody works I had two games back to back where i came top ten with decent amount of kills only to die to some dude that was one shot away from dying because the game crashed honestly until they decide to fix their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  id recommend playing Fortnitesince at least that can run without crashing,negative

Honestly  Don t buy this game it was great at first but now now it became a milking machine for the devs they make a lot of money without improving anything they don t fix the bugs or add new content such as a map  or if they do it takes months and it comes with a lot of bugs ofc but instead they add more CRATES but wait these crates aren t free you need to pay aroun 225 in order to buy a key and open itAnother negative trait of this game  the presence of hackers i recently experienced first hand the growing number of hackers we now reached a point where basically every games has got some hackers or some chinese guys who are unhittable thanks to the lag,negative
This is a great game Period the concept is great and it s quite entertaining But it does have some major flaws1 The servers sometimes lag out and you can time out of a game for no reason also I know i chose the NA sever but for some reason in my 30 hours of playing  at the time of writing this I ve only seen 2 players on my team in squad  and most of my time is on squad That can speak english and one of them couldnt really even speak idk if that is just me or something with the servers2 It s not really worth getting if you dont have a higher end PC because if you cannot run this consistantly then you will never win on ur own3 I cant really say that much about this but Cheating in my 30 hours of playing ive died to only one cheater but the problem was it was so blatant it was painful to watch the death cam 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing inventory splitting PLEASE add this if I could tell you how many times i ve had to turn down a teammate to give them ammo just because you cant split it is in the hundreds Bluehole pls get on that5 The drift on cars is TERRIBLE if you turn just a little bit and then try to straighten yourself out you will drift uncontrollably Also Bluehole you think you can get away with these maps i mean the locations are fine but come on the terrain looks like you took the mountain tool from unity and just randomly put hills and mountains around the main towns which leats to you clipping on the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing tiniest rock that you should be able to drive over Also AGAIN with the cars is the damage they do I was in a match and our car was parked by a building and i got in to drive next thing you know im telling my friends to get in because the barrier was about tom hit us I start to barley move and barley tap my teammate with Full LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing health and he got downed6 The aim The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing aim is so bad once again i was with my friends and he sot at point blank range with an akm and missed all 6 shots while the enemy and him were standing still  it also wasnt rapid firing either7 If you do NOT have friends to play this game with then you will be so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bored Anyways thats all that i can remember but if i were to rate this game id rate it 863110 Good game,positive
My PUBG is having issue of microphone problem It works and respond during game match and for the first 30 second of the gameplay,positive
The aiming isn t accurate you either die right after parachuting into the game or minutes into the game  seriously it s a 190 chance you ll win there s really bad reloading glitches  dropping a gun to pick up another will cause the magazine to be emptied and opening doors right after reloading will CANCEL the reloading the overuse of open environments is boring and could benefit from SOME  not too much but some corridor areas like facilities and whatnot as there s way too much ground to be shot at also helicopters would ve been nice  they don t have to be Apaches or nothing but SOMETHING to take advantage of that airspace Also the inventory screen is not as efficient as it really could be and takes too damn long to equip stuff with the whole drag and drop thingIt s somewhat fun and had a lot of potential but really think this game NEEDS more work to make it more interesting  especially with aiming and reloading As it is you re probably just gonna get sniped in the open or shot at from atopbeneath the stairs by people camping the location until the next play zone opens up,negative
Region Lock Anti Cheat Upgrade Better Optimization Fix These,positive
I actually heard a lot of bad things like players being toxic cheaters optimization problems etc but when I started playing it I had a lot of fun even though I played solo I m running the game on a low to mid tier laptop  GTX 960M at medium settings 1920 1080 and I have 40 fps lowest It is playable When my friends join I think I will have even more fun Buy the game and try it yourself Don t mind the comments much If you don t like it Refund it,positive

My favorite part about PUBG is how quickly you can get into the next game,positive
This game runs way better than it used to looks great and is generally a great experience if you like multiplayer short burst shooting action HOWEVER If you speak English  which Im sure you do dont expect to be able to play squad or duos without friends filling the lobby If you dont you will ALWAYS get a Chinese person or 3 in your team Along with that theres hackers that seem to be a Chinese players a majority of the timeThere is no Region Lock and thats sad for a game of this size In my opinion the lack of Region Lock ruined this game It was very fun even addicting up until a few months ago Now you cant even take the game seriously If I could refund this game I would have already Very dissappointing If you want to have some Battle Royale fun play Fortnite its free and theres a lot less hackers and you can expect to at least have English speaking teammates If they update the game with Region Lock and better anti hacks then I would highly recommend this game to any FPS fan,negative
Would like it if you only allow people from the region to play on the server all i hear is chinnese people on chat on english Also would like option to pick the map i hate the new map,negative
Overall the game is good still a bit clunky and some lag issues still The kill cam cannot be trusted so at this point i wouldnt even turn it on Biggest issue at the moment in my opinion is the hackers as in most fps games its a big issue that nobody seems to be able to stop A lot of people are complaining about the chinese being the largest amount of hackers and are not paying attention to everybody else that hacks The game still needs some tweaking and balancing but for the 36 dollars Canadian its worth the buy,positive
Great game Definately got my moneys worth However cheating is becoming far too frequent,negative
This game is a f kn disgrace I have a computer which is vastly superior to the minimum requirements and is on par with the recommended and the game runs at a solid 60 fps pace However IN MY LAST 3 F KN MATCHES after spending 20 30 minutes playing the round just about when I m going to engage in a gunfight with another player THE GAME STUTTERS LIKE CRAZY or even flatout freezes for a couple of seconds allowing the other player to easily hand my LOVE LOVE LOVE  back to me I find this entirely unacceptable because it defeats the entire purpose of the game It is a freaking shame that I have discovered this after two hours of playtime so I can t refund this crap,negative
The game was very good before the  full release  Yeah it was unoptimized and it had a lot of bugs but it was playable and fun to play Now It s trash I don t reccomend buying it now,negative

Region lock is needed otherwise the game is short and boring you re likely to get shot from across the map with a shotgun while they re driving Increase the price of the game so when the cheaters get banned its harder for them to buy back in,negative

This is funny Tried this game before with my friend s account  roughly 10 hours play and so yesterday i finally buy my own account and play like 3 rounds last night I am a bad player so i pretty much got destoried at the first 10 mins each game I got upset about myself so I stopped and play League then this morning my account got ban for no reasonYeah  there is  NO REASON  at all they didnt say anything regarding the ban or what so everThis ruins my day GJ PUBG,negative
This game has so many hackers that it makes the game unplayable and unenjoyable Literally 9 out of every 10 games will have hackers in it In one game I was killed by a guy with a shotgun who shot me through a mountain while I was in a warehouse I saw the kill cam he was a mile away from me Stay far away from this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor excuse for a game that wishes to be considered an esport,negative

The idea of the game is great but boyyy do they f cked this up The game randomly crashes whenever it likes to It is especially annoying since most of the games take 30min to an hour and then you re just dead Also there is no shooting testrange  how should you practice aim  at the beginning it sometimes drops you randomly and you take damage can t pick up weapons because of lag  no it s not my internet connection and the driving physics are just f cking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  You hit a little bump and your car flips or explodes it doesn t make sense Definitely goddamn Esports ready,negative
always crushing and lot of cheaters,negative
I just realised how long this review is so i ll just say pubg is sorta gud xDEveryone should know what PUBG is so i ll skip that part xDPUBG has good gameplay i find it to be skill based and the addition of first person last year makes the game more skill based which i find fun It does have cosmetics in the steam market which can be found in game or in the crates you unlock with BP I personally don t use crates even with BP and just buy some cosmetics on the steam market with the scraps in my steam wallet Back to the gameplay there is 2 ways to ads one way is holding down rmb which keeps you in tp but is less accurate and the other way is pressing right click which forces you into fp to look down the iron sights or whatever sight attachment you have on your gun this is also more accurate so it adds meaning to getting sights speaking of attachments there are plenty of attachments in game to modify your guns with you can find sight attachments as mentioned before grip attachments barrel attachments stocks or mag upgrades these attachments are all divided into each gun class for example a sub machine gun mag can t go on an ar the only attachment this doesn t apply to is the sights and you can even use a red dot on the pistol i personally find this game to be better and more engaging than fortnite but this doesn t have building and fortnite is a lot more casual which is better for some players There however has been a lot of problems to do with the way pubg corp handles the community including player unknown himself The game has also still apparently got fps problems which i personally don t suffer from and might have some other bugs inside don t let the fact it is out of early access fool youOverall i think the best option is to wait for a sale which is not what i didIf you read this far you deserve a medel xD,positive
I didnt know what to write This game has got a lot of cons  cheaters optimalization the require of an SSD you name it but I must admit I like Its a beatiful experience and I am sure you will like it Currently the best Battle Royale experience out there,positive

the game is overall good but please have a dedicated server for chinese players since i knew that the asia server is kinda full which they go to the other servers,positive
I got this game on Christmas and still I ve learned a lot I ve learned more things than you can imagine a person like me could understand Not first off I m not gonna be another one of those butt hurt people complaining about chinese hackers On one of the recent updates they added region lock Not all the way tho It s more of a ping lock so chinese people with sky high ping probably can t join the same server as you I haven t come across a signle chinese hacker at all since the update Definitly recommend this game but seriously the cosmetic prices are WAYYYYYYY to expensive either that or add a TON more cosmetics And for the love of God  DON T MAKE GUN SKINS IT S PARTIALLY RUINED CS GO,positive
Used to have crates without keys Used to play with people who spoke english Now there are keys alittle less laggy but less people I can talk with Uninstalling since I can t open my crates anymore Just because CS GO does it does not mean you should do it too Hope the game falls off from here  ,negative
I thought this was a US title but appears not I was the only person that spoke english Chinese speaking game only least I think thats what language I only heard    Also on my third game someone ported in my room via some sort of hack to kill me I thought perhaps it was the game its self as I was experience some pretty bad video lag and I was running on normal settings where as all other games I play at max settings with dual 980 video cards   Doesnt appear to be stable yet   Be interested in trying again if there was an option to communicate in English refunded this purchase,negative
I have played many FPSs over the years from vanilla COD to BF4  now PUBG Like any other FPS PUBG is riddled with aimbotters and wallhacks You can occassionally get a round in where you get to the final 10 and you get bumped off by a legit player or get the victory Outside of the hacking the game is quite enjoyable Graphics are good playability and interface are above average It is addictive fun Just don t punch your monitor when that hacker picks you off after you have tactically moved from building to building looting weapons and attachments for 25 minutes He is running full sprint stops pulls his kar98 and headshots you from 1000m My other favorite is the AKM with no recoil classic  No matter how many times you watch the death cam you can t see yourself in the distance  If you can t brush off the cheaters and will ultimately put a fist through your monitor from the frustration  I do not reccomend this game Until the developers come up with a legit anti cheat system  won t happen I don t reccomend it either I however will keep playing endless hours of this game because it is my goal to outplay the cheats Simply because the team play is fun and I am ok with coming in 3rd behind the cheaters,negative

Way too many chinese on the na servers and as soon as they find out that you are english they kill you Also instead of giving china a server  this game made 4 mill in the first 3 months i m sure they could afford it they instead partenered with the most popular vpn that the chinese would use to get better internet connection on far away servers and they put ads on it Literally the most greedy thing you could do in this situation Also there are quite a few cheaters i ve played against and when i see their name its a chinese guy,negative

So after all the months of this being out and hearing all the good and the bad I finally tried it out myself I fell in love with the games open world setting and scavenging But what blew the whoel LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game for me was that you put in a good amount of time playing and then bam some guy shoots a gun in your direction and you die I watched the deathcam footage the guy just fired the gun in teh vicinity of my direction I was in a car going fast he shot twice totally missed and killed me It s cool but if they are able to hack the game I m wasting my time,negative
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Read the negative reviews about region locks and hackers from China and you will begin to understand what is happening here Another game that will never be what it could have been just like DayZ and WarZ  or Infestation LOL wtf They get your money in Early Access and there is no incentive to actually fix what was wrong I have been playing for a long time and every update has made things worse 210 because winning can be fun but good luck winning without SUPER INTERNET FROM THE FUTURE cause the lag is unplayable,negative
This game is fun but for me it lost its shine very quickly I found that the game is poorly optimised and often lags and suffers pop in a lot My setup is an i5 8400 and GTX 1070 with 8GB RAM and it still lags This game is out of early access and is still buggy in my experience and a bit broken I do not like this game and I don t recommend it,negative

This is a game with great potential but the devs managed to butcher it  Lag at the beginning of each round  Random knockouts when vaulting  Literal traps in the therrain where if you fall in you cant get out  Getting stuck in props  between cactus and wall for eg  Overwhelming amount of cheaters some of them getting hits through terrain  khm srv validation And these are just some of the major gripesApparently they also tuned down the available loot to motivate people to engate i guessWell in reality theres more camping now that weapons are more scarce,negative

Was a great game now you cant play without cheaters  Appears nothing is being done about it  If you want frustration this is the game for you  I have tried reporting players to no avail  I have a video of a cheater but when I add it to a report in PUBG support you cannot submit the report,negative

This kind of xenophobic attitude that a lot of Western players seem to have online is just disgraceful It s 2017 We live on one big planet together What the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I m quite ashamed of those players that shout these things out We want to create a great space for everyone to enjoy across the globe and locking one region out  I don t know what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  theyre thinking   GreeneYou are a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing idiotEDIT  I am neither for nor against region locking China What i want to say though is that in my opinion Greene is a complete moron and i have no respect for him He fails to realize that most of the people that are complaining about the Chinese playerbase are not racists but just tired of dealing with cheaters and have valid points for asking to region lock China Greene was the one who said that around 90  of the cheaters in this game are located in China If it was the US that was causing 90  of the problem people would ask to region lock the players located in the US from European servers and visa versa Calling people xenophobic just because they are westerners when they have very valid points that have nothing to do with race is pretty racist in my opinion What is really  disgraceful  Greene is your greed and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  attitude  You are making a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  load of money use a tiny portion of it to figure out how to fix this issue instead of being a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
And just like H1Z1 died it seems this game will die to  chinese cheaters as they are encountered pretty much every game at this point And as much as Battleye is banning hundreds of thousands of players it still persists because bluehole isn t setting up any serverside countermeasures and there is only so much battleye can do as an anticheat,negative

Great concept Terrible game I have been playing first person shooters for 20 years This is by far the sorriest POS excuse for a game I have every seen Lags crashes impossible to play When you do get a few seconds of functioning game you spend it running across what looks like an unfinished game doing nothing Oh wow you saw someone cool lets go check it out Then itll hang and youre dead EVERY SINGLE TIME This thing says Ive played for 3 hours Literally 1 hour of that MAYBE was functional game play and thats being generous Save you money or give it to a bum or burn it Itll be more fun than this absolute garbage,negative

Dealing with every graphical error glitch mistake flaw un optimization since release seemed horrible at the time but now with the huge waves of hackers at least every game has made those issues small fish The hacking epidemic a community caused problem has created such poor gameplay that I can only give this game a negative review until it is fixed  quite easily with a region lock,negative

If youre good at aiming then this is the game for you Due to the Christmas sale it appears everyone or atleast all the new players are not very good at the game For example in solo they might stand in place providing an easy headshot Unfortunatly through out my PUBG carrier they have wiped the leaderboards several times Im still uncertain on how many wins i have on the game  somewhere between 15 30 A new method to solve this problem is to screenshot your wins which i have implemented last week,positive

Bluehole have lost the trust of gamers Each update comes less and less fixes and optimizations yet more and more money grabbing skins and crates I put up with it through early access because hey it s early access but then they rushed it to full release so the could put it on console for more cash grab It just keeps going down hill RIP PUBG we had some good times but we had way too many bad times,negative

There are so many problems with this game Crashes bugs glitches connection problems This is staright up unacceptable from the number 1 trending game on steam When you drive a car the game often does starnge things  like flipping from the smallest little thing on the ground I have 500mbs internet and it still has network connection problems Everything  im not joking everything is full of bugs the cars the weapons the clothes When i watch a death cam or spectate my partner then he isnt even shooting at where he is aiming When you hit someone with the slightest power of a vehicle he instantly loses half of his hp or more The game often has network problems mid fight when i aim at somebody The moment when i stopped playing this game is when i was second i saw the other guy and the game crashed on me Thats when i was LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  done with this unfinished mess Of course the game itself is really fun it can make your heart beat faster than ever but still i wouldnt recommend buying it until the developers finish the game Oh and please region lock China,negative

This is by far one of the worst of the  battle royal  gamesIt s laggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  buggy unstable servers throughout the entire game Rubber banding You can shoot someone 7 times and  knock  him out and then you have to shoot him up to 4 more times just to kill him Bodyarmours and helmets can be found in different  tiers   1 3 As always the 3 is very overpowerd It s also badly optimized and a lot  fps There s a lot of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t factors like you clearly aim above the ground or ledge but still the bullets go into the object infront of you DickShots Bullets travel at a speed up to 900kmh and still you have to  lead  your shots quite a bit at just 100meters Do not buy this game unless you want to get aids and cancer at the same time This game has almost the same  problems  that H1Z1 had in it s early days with bad hitreg and crap servers with a lot of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t factors and bad FPS,negative

The gameplay sucks You spend majority of your time in this game scavenging running towards the circle and camping rather than actually fighting Combat essentially boils down to whoever has the sight of the enemy first So if the enemy sees you first high probability you will be dead This game reward cowards Most people who got chicken dinner choose to land on some secluded area and just keep camping till the end If this is your definition of fun perhaps try playing lego Its much more entertaining than this game,negative

Chinese hackers ruin this game The game s creator Brendan Greene had this to say  Yes the majority of cheaters come out of China but that doesn t mean all Chinese players are cheaters This idea that just because you ve got a few bad eggs you ve got to ban a whole country is a bit reactive  he said  They love the game Why would we restrict them from playing on servers  I just don t get the attitude of some people  Maybe becuase they ruin it for everyone else restrict them to their own server region or start getting real about banning people who use aimbots and the like Got bored with the game after a week becuase I m tired of getting magically killed from someone who is looking at the ground or staring into the sun,negative

Used to be a game I loved and enjoyed playing but is quickly turning into a cash grabbing money machine Every time a new big patch comes out all we get is more loot crates that we have to pay to open I must have about 50 crates in my inventory that I cannot open without purchasing a key from the store combine this fact and the fact that for the same reason of GREED that you now have to top up your wallet with a minimum of 4 every time you want to buy something that costs les than that So now my crates are clogged up with stuff I cant open its so frustrating finally getting the BP to open a new crate only to get one that I have to pay for Anything you earn from BP should be your right to open freely if you want all this rare stuff to be in the crates you need a key for then just charge for them seperately dont force me to get crates I have to pay for,negative

Hello everyone I bought PUBG in July 17  because all of my friends were telling me about how this game is amazing and super enjoyable saying it was non stop fun And for the most part it was I had a lot of fun with friends and it was a blastUntil about a month agoIf none of my friends are in the mood to play pubg I would just play with randoms and they wood be really nice and fun to play with Now all I get are people in the North American servers who I AM CERTAIN ARE NOT FROM NORTH AMERICA they don t know English or Spanish and they usually end up dying about 5 or 6 minutes into the gameAnother problem I have with this game my BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME is the cheating It s been a problem for about a month now but it s gotten much worse over the last week My friend and I were in a duo and got to top 10 we saw a team running in the middle of the road a bit away from us and we both had kar98ks so we shot at them I hit one of the guys and knocked him down while my friend Gavin hit the other guy  The guy my friend Gavin was firing at stopped healed back to full health in less than a second and then fired us down more than a hundred meters away with a UMPMy last 10 games have literally been ended by cheaters  This is a really big problem right now and I know that Bluehole is cracking down on them but this is a game that has topped steam charts for more than two months now There is an insane player count and it s still growing which leads me to think that the sales are probably going up too Bluehole has a multi billion dollar game and they can t crack down on cheaters fast enough My advice for them is that they hire more staff that JUST COVER REPORTS the reviews used to be in the 90s and they are going down FAST 45  positive recent reviews isn t good at all and having a quick look at reviews you can see that there are two main reasons for negative reviews 1 Cheaters       There s an easy fix for this hire more staff to COVER ONLY REPORTS and the cheater count will be going down2 Chinese players flocking to North American Servers       There s an easy fix to this too and it s the same fix as 1 CRACK DOWN ON CHEATERS the reason they are flocking to NA is the same reason NA players are quitting Cheaters As far as I can tell there is a way bigger problem with cheating on the chinese servers and cracking down on cheaters will make people more enticed to play this games Plus the Chinese players will immigrate back to their servers where they get better ping and the cheating problem will go away if Bluehole does it rightIf you asked me 2 months ago I would give PUBG a 1010 besides the fps issues on PC s that should be perfectly capable to run the game on high settings with more than 60 fps Though recently I just can t reccomend the game I can tell the community agrees with me considering the amount of positive reviews are going down and the negative reviews are going up We need Bluehole to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and give their 110  to fix this game I m not saying region lock China I m just saying fix the cheating and optimize it more and the game will be a masterpiecePeace outLiam,negative

I ve been playing since this first launched on Steam It was a lot of fun even with crashes bugs lag etc Now I get a few crashes and no lag or major glitches The bikes still have issues though However ever since 10 was released the amount of hackers has been unreal Hacking wasn t that big of a problem previously but now almost every single game is ruined by a hacker and the death cam confirms The Chinese raiding the North American servers was funny at first but now all the hackers have come to Northern American servers and is completely ruining the game Would I buy this game again two months ago yes Would I recommend buying it now  No,negative
Needs to be region locked The lag is the main issue in the game You optimized the game very well but some more minor changes will make the game great,negative

I recomend this game if you like this style of game but i must say I am verry dissapointed in the admins During the startup of the game i never had a chance to customize my character and now im stuck with one i never picked they should let us reset it I am furious with the fact that i have to spend 3000 coins to change something i never even made,positive
Once the novelty wears off one becomes aware of just what a steaming pile of poorly coded crap this is The combat in this game is an unreliable hodgepodge of horrendous netcode Foreign players on other country s servers compound the problem Hackers make it even worse You can never have a fair gunfight in this game one side will always have the tickrate advantage and it is infuriating I ve uninstalled this trash for the last time,negative
Game developers Bluehole have made a severe and potentially fatal mistake with PUBG They have ignored the outcry of loyal longtime players for change when it comes to region locking game serversI don t mind playing a game with people who don t speak my language I don t mind it every once in a while But when I sit down to play PUBG in a North American server there should be some English speaking players at least every so often I started playing again a few days ago after a year long hiatus  back when region servers had purpose and so far after around twenty or thirty maybe more matches I have played with a total of three English speaking playersThis isn t about not liking Chinese people I ve even tried to learn some Mandarin to ease the in game struggle of communicating during intense moments and pathfinding strategies But this doesn t make any sense The amount of Chinese players in the North American servers is absurd and unacceptableAnd Bluehole has ignored the overwhelming response to the issue Now you have to go out of your way to find an English speaking community in PUBG for the NORTH AMERICAN servers just so you can enjoy playing But the way I see it this is as much a problem with the game as any technical aspect that might cripple a player s experience and if the game s broken I won t recommend itI loved PUBG when it came out I m trying to stick around and keep enjoying it but I don t see myself staying on too much longer There are other games that work as intended with region locked servers that make LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing senseDon t waste your hard earned money on this a once beautiful and thrilling combat experience reduced to rubble by shameful ignorance,negative

I would give this game a good review but the creator Brendon LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE face had to go and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  me off to the point of giving it a bad review Heres why1  The game as it currently stands has a huge issue with hackers 99  of which are from China   A figure that Brenden himself has disclosed 2  The Chinese servers are so bad that its preferable for Chinese players to play on American Oceanic  European servers instead This causes massive issues with ping and just overall makes the game less enjoyable   thats not even mentioning the language barrier and the Hacking  3  Instead of fixing this  with a region lock or better anti hack both would be nice Brenden has said that western players make him sick and that they are all Xenophobes for saying they don t want to play with Chinese players they must all be racists 4  What a stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE face don t buy this game until Brenden pulls his head out of his LOVE LOVE LOVE  and starts speaking sense Hes only saying this because the majority of his player base are Chinese and he can t be LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed fixing his game Region lock isn t racist its good for everyone and if the Chinese don t like it because your servers in China are too LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  then fix them,negative

UPDATE  Since I first posted this review the game has improved drastically The problem of cheaters has diminished a huge amount and in general the game is just getting better and better As much hate as it gets I think this game is absolutely amazing and I still love it to bits Every game has bugs and glitches and honestly sometimes that can make them fun  of course there are infuriating ones as well Updating this review from negative to positive Absolutely love this gameIt s a good game A great game even but it s getting far too much when every game you play you get into the top 5 players only to get killed by a man who s shooting at the floor across the other side of the zone Or to drop in perfectly at your destination before everyone else only for your parachute to get stuck in the air or taking half of your health from fall damage after dropping 2 feet Or trying to vault over a wall and dying for no reason at all Or the bloody awful desync being behind cover then getting shot by a man who s seeing 10 seconds ago I keep playing this game it s actually incredibly fun and action packed but there s a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed with it The hackers are by far the worst thing at the moment and more and more keep appearing by the day  most commonly based on my experience players from Asian servers who come to EU servers and cheat I m sure there are a heck of a lot of players who play on EU from Asia that don t cheat it just seems suddenly that a lot more keep playingRegionLockEveryRegion,positive

PUBG full of cheaters GTA 5 full of cheaters almost all online games are full of cheaters I am really definitely absolutely sick of this I will never ever gonna give a penny to an online game again The thing is the devs dont give a      about it Hey devs continue like this and you will end up having games full of cheaters who even dont buy your game  they get it also by cheating because all they know is cheating They even got into this world as a result of their fathers cheating on their mothers So their whole world is cheating From now on I will stick to the single player games I think  if every legit player who wants a legit competition does the same thing the devs will have no choice but to start a merciless fight against cheating and cheaters,negative
This game is perfectly fine I live in NA and never encountered a single cheater This game runs well on my PC and doesn t kill my processor  Intel i7 7700K 420 GHZ I have absolutely no problems with this game,positive
This game is littered with chinese hackers and laggers who bluehole wont do anything about because that would be offensive They also wont stop selling their real money crates which is helping drive the demand for cheaters to use hacks to gain more BP   They just want more money  The tick rate is awful and hits often just dont register even when on your screen they are pouring out blood on their screen they lose 10 health With the low tick rate laggers can kill you where you were a long time ago meanwhile they warp around and hits on them dont register till youre dead and then the damage is deleted because you are dead,negative
  TL DR  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  Review  So PUBG first caught my attention when it blew up in popularity through various media platforms  Twitch YouTube Reddit etc and looked to be a fresh take on a previously untapped game genre  for the most part For the first few weeks even the bug riddled mess that this game was found itself rapidly becoming one of the most fun games I ve ever played If you wanted to run solo and  tryhard  you could If you wanted to mess around and try to get your friends killed in the most imaginative ways you could think of you could PUBG was an awesome look into what a Battle Royale game  should  be For the most part guns were balanced and gameplay  felt  great It was a refreshing venture back into tactical gameplay with a play as you like twist  any strategy was viable if you were good at it Now PlayerUnknown  whom for simplicity s sake I ll refer to as  PU  henceforth himself has sentenced his cash cow to death  at least for Westerners The game went from a hilariously fun pastime to a disappointing chore Every time I get the itch to play PUBG I queue up for any game mode  solo duo squad TPP FPP and am almost always immediately reminded why I and many others cannot stand the game anymore  hackers This game has  THE  most rampant and unabated cheating problem of  ANY  video game I have  EVER  played online By his own admission PU has gone on record stating  paraphrasing  99  of known cheaters in PUBG are Chinese  Almost immediately after an overwhelming portion of the community has started to demand Bluehole  now PUBG Corp I believe region lock China to which PU has called his playerbase  xenophobic  The result of this assumed xenophobia is a plague that every Western player is now subjected to I have personally experienced a game with  EVERY SINGLE ONE  of the following issues In every one of these games the culprit had a completely gibberish string of charactersnumbers and spoke Chinese  also keep in mind this is on the North American server  Teleporting hacks  Increased movespeed hacks  Aimbot and instant kill hacks  No recoil hacks  usually found with aimbots  Invincibility hacks   Wall  hacks  the ability to see other players through walls buildings etc  Being randomly placed in squad games with one or more Chinese players who refuse  and realistically cannot communicate with the rest of the team  Chinese  teamers    randomly  queued players who surpass the limit of 4 per team and group up to form a horde  And many many moreThere is no greater disappointment than to spend 30 minutes in a game scavenging and looting the best gear you can possibly find only to be instantly killed by a Chinese hacker Playing the game is nothing more than a colossal waste of time nowadays With the stance he s taken PU has made it clear he has no intention of solving this problem as  60  of the playerbase is in China  Rather than upgrading any sort of anti cheat or punishing the infinite amount of cheaters in the game Bluehole seems more preoccupied with creating and rolling out new cosmetic cratesI do not foresee a future in which PU acknowledges that what Bluehole is doing is nearing the definition of  corporate greed  with each day that passes and it truly is a shame PUBG was a great game   emphasis on  was Don t waste your time with this game Save yourself the frustration and money Go play FortniteDO NOT BUY THIS GAME,negative

Here are some words from a Chinese player to all of you guys who have the idea of  region lock China As you know because of PUBG the steam s playernumber of China has exploded from last April and most of them will play this game only More players means harder to control the problem of cheating so this situation might give you a thought that we are all Cheaters But trust me we hate those mother f  kers just like all of you guys As for the situation that you can only meet chinese even in your own server that might be the problem of Bluehole we don t have our own server in China even though more than half of PUBG players are from China so we have to join in other server with high ping But thanks Tencent  Although it doing gaming just a piece of s  t  this situation might soon chang  most of only PUBG player will leave steam also mean most of cheating will disappear and the truely player will stay And trust us we re totaly different from those people Now what I want to say is region lock us is unfair to us and it won t be the way to solve this problem And the words like  those Chinese are all Cheaters  is definitely discriminating I hope you could change your mind That s all Thank you,positive

I have absolutely zero clue why the hell people are giving PUBG so much crap right now with their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  reviewsI haven t played a whole lot lately but all these complaints about hackers  Sure I sometimes question how someone managed to kill me but to my knowledge I have never encountered a hacker  in EU servers Neither have my friendsI do see a problem with the whole lootbox system but 1 it s there since the early stages of the game so why are people LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing now and 2 it s not pay to win It s gambling which should be illegal in most countries and distracts the devs from further development That does not take away that PUBG is still the ultimate Battle Royale experience as isTo explain that I refuse to turn this into a fancy review explaining what I approve or disapprove of in regards to Graphics Gameplay and Mechanics and more The point is that this game did what DayZ did not What H1Z1 could not What Fortnite still cannot  though being hugely popular with the younger audiences And what many other games including your common casual shooter can never achieveIt s a shooter with reliable shooting mechanics It s easy to get into but will require some degree of skills to master It has quite a lot of variation and randomness compared to other games in the genre Controls are fluid as is operating your character in the world There are third and first person options depending on your preference In fact they made the game more competitive by adding so much more attachments and scopes that everyone is bound to get a feasible build for the late game these days These devs started out with a winning concept and finetuned it perfectly so farBasically this game has the formula right Something that very few modern games manages to reach Do not for a second trust any of the negative reviews which are all written out of spite for supposed hackers or the whole lootbox situation The only thing I dislike of Bluehole is the fact that they have arbitrarily banned random players without evidence but have let offending streamers off the hook because they are promoting their game That and lootboxes are the only gripes I can name and neither have an impact on the foundation of this game  the perfect gameplayIf you are dying for a proper Battle Royale shooter to play with or without your friends against other people this is simply the way to go,positive

One of the hottest fps action games in the market recently Based on the battle royale concept from Fornite  Battle Royale PUBG works on a different touch Omitting the special abilities PUBG relies on player s aiming skills hand eye coordination and ability to distinguish distance and location of footsteps in the game Those are the fundamental capabilities that work across every battle mode in the game  solo  duo or squadParachuted into a map of 6 km by 6 km your own survival relies on your own skills teamwork   communication and perhaps followed by a small percentage of luck The intense competition starts at the second you land on the ground Finding the best locations for best possible loots of various armories protective armors and vehicles Each single decision will define the end result of your survivalPUBG is a highly competitive game while for solo mode sounds tough playing as duo or squad does also challenge us into many different aspects Loot sharing will not only help you in the game but as well as in the community Communication lies deeply when playing duo or squad as every bit of intel or information is critical or important Navigating through the map pin point enemy location supply drop to finding cover locations are also the abilities you need to practice The bullets  travel time and bullet drop are just two of various factors each player should learn by experience Unlike some of other FPS titles PUBG has a more complex physics in term of long range shooting Each weapon has their own unique characteristics and bullet drop Distance matters How far your target from your location and where you put your crosshair on the enemies will define your final fate in the gameThe intensity of the game also relies on how you handle emotion and ego Your playstyle most likely will change from round to round or even in a round you have to be able to adjust yourself well The pace will change every single time a new round starts Players are required to read the situation and adjust the pacing from rushing to taking over planning a flank or even fleeingretreatingPatience is also a virtue in this game Tho the pacing would be fast being patient does reward you in the long run It will give players more ability and space to adjust and reconstruct their playstyle Being in a squad there are some traits you have to have such as adaptable to different tactics or strategies All in all PUBG asks and lets players to explore their best capabilities to conquer the map for each round This includes to adapt playing in a group Players will be rewarded with BP for each damage they deal to any enemies including killing the enemies This will then be able to be exchanged with crates in which will give the players some cosmetic items from head gears to footwears Some have high value in the Steam Market due to the rarity and equipping your toon with some of the items also shows some exclusive pride While some players might not have significant interests in doing soThe community is great with so many veteran players enjoy sharing their experiences and tips Suggestions and feedbacks are widely welcomed On the personal level this is one of the FPS games that has a pretty low level of trollings or trash talkingIf you enjoy playing FPS with unlimited possibilities of fun PUBG has everything to offer,positive
I absolutely LOVE this game when i get in a normal round EXCEPT i have found from my personal experience that there are WAY TOO MANY HACKERS Today I played 10 games and in 4 of them died to people hip firing me from hundreds of metres away through trees without line of sight PUBG FIX THIS ASAP,negative

Great game but cheaters are really getting out of control and even though they say they have an anti cheat system in place it really seems not to be working Every single game you find a cheater If they could solve this this game would be the best but its just really annoying to play it right now and not fun at all,negative
this game is a love hate relationship for me,positive

Great concept for a game and partialy good execution I like the idea behind the last man standing matches and large mapplayer style BUT the cheating is beyond a pain in the butt About every 2 to 3 matches played have a cheater of some sort in them From the auto aim to the map hackers that know where you are from your location on the map and these are just 2 of the most common I have seen It is completely ruining the game you spend 20 mins getting equipment moving to good positions and even getting into some good fair fire fights then BOOM your dead from a guy 300 yards away no scoping with a SMG who never really saw you he just stoped and pulled the trigger and your dead FUN I do not recomend anyone else buying this game untill something major is done with the cheaters may they be from China or any other location,negative
At first glance this game has everything a survival shooter needs to become successful and it does have potential but I cannot agree with the way the game is being managed after all why spend 3000 if youll just be banned from playing If you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time you could be banned for one semi famous streamers accusation The rampant lag spikes of chinese players creates time travel like abilities allowing them to enter building without being seenshooting you when they are on the groundand the language barrier makes them useless in team combat and that s if they don t team kill you first Game breaking glitches that will make you either die or wish that you did Creaters would much rather call you a racistbigotor xenophobe rather than deal with the shortcomings of the gameWhile I believe the game does hold some promis the road it s going down doesn t look bright,negative
This game has a lot of potential Lots of fun with a group of buddies intense skirmishes it s got a lot to like Unfortunately it seems like 910 times you die to someone with an aimbot or some other cheat Really sucks the fun out of the experience The devs really to need to consider region blocking or ping capping I would not recommend picking this game up until that occurs  unless you re a glutton for punishment,negative

PUBG is an  okay  battle royale type game  I think it surpasses H1Z1 and Fortnite However it still has server issues bugs etc  This should not be a problem with a  fully released  game  I ve played a lot of PUBG and encountered a lot of these problems  Mostly Duo s and 4 man squad s because I have more fun playing with my friends  Its the type of game that can get boring playing with yourself  The bugs and various issues can be solved but I don t think it will get the attention it is deservedThere is one huge issue with this game which leads me to not recomending it  The amount of hackers is unbelievable  Their solution is to let players report after the death cam in the game after you die  While I see at this can work it will not solve the issue  I suspect players will falsify cheating reports  because they don t know for sure if a player was hacking or just sending reports because they were mad at their opponent for killing them  This creates a problem for the people who do report actual hackers because they might be overlooked  On a side note I just came from a game where a hacker killed me 1000m standing still with a UMP in 2 shots and having erratic mouse movementsPUBG has so much potential but like most big games it will die and something else will replace itUntil this is resolved I will rarely play unless I am with friends,negative
It was a good game when the crates where free now you grind for crates and all you get is these LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  desperado crates that cost 250 to open can i just get the non micro transaction crates after posting this review i realized these crates were selling for 343 and i sold both of them for 618 im gonna have to put a possitive review on this game for that,positive

I like the gameplay and the maps that are out but it s really hard to play the game properly if you can t understand your own teammates so please region lock the game or set it so that when you first start the game you select a language and you only get fellow team mates with that language although the second is not the best option because it suck being hit by someone you just killed,negative

this game sucks DO NOT BUY all the time I get killed by hackers  mostly from china I know because of their lag They could fix this whole game by region locking but all the time they are just a bunch of idiots saying thats racist but its not if you region block everyone 99  of hackers are chinese so how is it racist  I know the real reason you don t do it you want to get more and more moneyONE WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER IS BY REGION LOCKING,negative
Alright let s go straight to the things that make this game a success and why it is a TERRIBLE platform all at the same timePros  Game introduced alot of customization that entices the player to find the best loot for their weapons ultimately to continue to top 10 and lastly to be the top team of the game Firefights when fought are extremely action packed and can be really fun to engage in when with teammates  and solo admittedly Updates are quite frequent compared to other EA games  before 10 update and has spearheaded its way into setting a precedent for other upcoming developers When on higher setting graphics the game looks visually appealingalthough this game has made an impact on Steam for being the No1 played game OAT it is still susceptible to stupid shenanigans that the developers unfortunately allowCons Without a shadow of a doubt  SERVER HOPPING          Games such as H1Z1 were riddled with AS server players because they abused the hell out of their ping and this game is no exception since its rise to the top This is one of the MAIN things that I think needs to be addressed  furthermore with the allowing of players to server hop they set a dangerous precedent that will allow other EA or AAA developers to allow such a feature this shouldn t be the case With the addition of a couple million users came the hackers you ll happily loot an area only to be sniped from 1000M away and insta die or shoot someone to oblivion only to see that your bullets had 0 affect whatsoever take caution whenever entering new lobbies Last but definitely not least the Drop System Have you ever gone to the rooftop of a building whilst someone is downstairs and you go to  try to find a weapon only to not find one on the upper floors as the person below waits with an AR  this game is HILARIOUSLY ridiculous when it comes to that You either find what you need in the first 10 seconds or the first 15 minutes it always seems to be hit or miss and it is something that NEEDS to be addressedAs much as I love to play this game It s the problems with the high ping AS players on NA servers Cheaters and Loot System that constantly push me back from actually enjoying this game hope this was a helpful review play safe,negative

I would reccomend this game This game is a lot of fun but the amount of bugs and issues make it not as fun at times like i said I would reccomend this game but i have to give it a negative review for a few reasons first my biggest problem the player in my game i was playing a game and i was getting shot at in the death cam the player was chinese and was not even aiming at me when he mag was empty i was still alive without him even reloading i was dead the lack of reigon locking the players makes the game un injoyable at times also whe i open the game the default server i was on was aisa i swiched it to NA i love this game but the number of players in a server with really high pings make the game no fun at times the bugs don t bug me that much since i don t see them as much but the chinese players with their high ping is not the best i hope they reigon lock players or get more servers for certain areas i would reccomend this game all the way but not at the moment,positive

After launch several issues have surfaced is borderline unplayable at the moment Was better when the game was in early access,negative
At the time of writing this Pubg is objectively not very good yet is also somehow fun and addicting It s amazing for screwing around by yourself or with friends but as soon as you start playing to win you begin to notice that your strongest opponent is often the game itself,positive
Wouldn t recommend for nowNot going to lie I enjoy this game at some occasions but most of the time it s just running around finding 2 people to kill and then die in the end because you got shot in the back by a person from an unknown location You may ask yourself now   Aren t you just a bad player then   Well yes and no the highest amount of kills i ve got in a single game was only 5 which is pretty pathetic compared to some pro player like Shroud who get 20 kills atleast in a single game But one of the biggest problems I have with the game is the amount of content is has It has no ranked matchmaking for no particular it has only 2 gamemodes and only 2 maps Also there is no reward system at all apparently when you win a game you get credits which are called  BP  which you can spend on crates or to customize your character again Which became kinda useless because you can literally buy crates of the market for almost nothingThe worst part of the game is in my opinion the peformance the game still has LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor framerate for a game this simple the netcoding is ridiculous mostly at the beginning of the game because god have I seen so much people having trouble to pick up their weapons because the terrible netcoding won t let them do it And the last thing I want to mention is how little to no customization there is you can t change your crosshair your reticle color TP FOV ETCComing to the conclussion PUBG is a sometimes fun but absolute bad game and is still in  Early Access  it just doesn t have the tag on it If you re intressed in buying the game I simply wouldn t recommend it atleast for now I m just interested in the future of the game because it could turn out it two ways  1 Brendan Greene actually gets of his lazy LOVE LOVE LOVE  and fixes this monstrosity of a game to a somewhat decent game 2 It ends like H1Z1 and DayZ and it will be forgotten and hated in a few monthsAnd now for the final verdict 510  What a piece of oathloving shi ,negative
For a full release game the bugs and hacks are still too muchDon t get me wrong Gameplay is a beautiful mess where you re just as likely to get in the car as you are stand there getting shot at in shutter speed There s a ton of different guns to and gear to salvage from and there s nothing quite like being the last man standing out of 100 But people will do anything to get there Including cheesing the system And speed hacking Or clipping Maybe it will be patched out maybe not But right now even with the millions of us playing I still say wait and see610  for now,negative

I cannot recommend this game in its current condition Played it now after 4 months pause and the performance and desync is currently even worse than before when 10 was released For me this is unplayable seeing my shots hit like 10 times but after watching the death cam of the enemy only 1 or 2 registered You can see this also when you watch streams on twitch by people who get paid for it and have super highend computers They complain all the time how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game is but they keep playing because they have stream snipers and therefore much more kills and action than regular playersI have a GTX 1070 16 GB DDR4 and i7 6700K Most of the time i have almost 100 fps but in fights and some areas on the maps it feels like 20 30 fps I keep watching future patchnotes and if there is no fix for netcode and performance then i will not play this game againTL DR  Game has bad performance and bad netcode Constantly lagging desync and massive FPS drops ,negative

Nice game to be recommended ,positive
It s hard Takes a long time to get used to the machanics in game if youre used to more polished games The dev s have fixed a few things more needs to be fixed But the game is still a lot of fun Squad with friends if you can it makes things much easier Stick with it use discord or TS Use the in game comms to hear the others ie   China numba 1  or  Wadu hack   etc Always peolpe playing 24 7 The hacking seems under control more lately  Devs posted that about half of the 3 million players were banned for hacks  thats a lot of hacking The bugs in game make it interesting at times It s not a big deal Broken as it is I still play it more than anything else right now To update after 700 plus hrs  Region lock China It s out of control and gets toxic can t team up with english speaking players in NA The lag advantaje with NA is as obvious as the hacks on the Asia server Why else is NA almosst all Chinese ,positive

90  the cheaters came from China but 90  Chinese players did not cheat As a normal player I hate cheating as much as most Chinese players But the blue LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  company can do nothing with cheating but guide the public opinion to push the Chinese players into the wind and waves lock the Chinese area and let the Chinese normal players be responsible for it Where are the rights of our normal players  Why do we have to pay for the cheaters  Garbage director garbage company garbage game90 90 ,negative
full of hackers and laggers from china 99100 people i meet in the game in squads and duos dont speak english on the north american server and lag like crazy alot of times i get killed by hackers i have a video on my phone where i got killed from 800 meters away by a flickshot also where i got killed while out of sight with a pistol every shot hit me 3 shots fired 3 headshots atleast 300 meters all of them have one thing in common chinese names This like many others was a good game but then it was ruined when the devs made all the money they wanted and dont want to offend anyone by region locking like every game creaters only give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about money and not players in the military if one person LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s up they punish the entire squad so everyone keeps that person in check and doing what hes supposed to do it may not make everyone happy quite the opposite actually but it WORKS its effective,negative
great game however   The amount of cheaters is rediculous  For such a popular game that has been around quite some time now the amount of STUPID bugs is incredible Some bugs that were here in the beta are still around  The ingame sound is just HORRIBAD in terms of hearing surrounding footsteps for example The sound effects of bombs and stuff just amateurhour,negative
This game used to be really fun until a bit prior to the official 10 release when during one patch they ruined a lot of things that were good in the game Driving vehicles used to be a lot of fun then they changed it so that it is extremely easy to flip over and very hard to control them in generalBut by far the biggest negative change in this game is the looting phase which has always been very long and kinda of annoying but instead of improving this by adding in better loot spawns in more locations and better weapons more often they did the exact opposite where they made it virtually pointless to go to any location other than super hot spots And this continues to get worse with each time I try to play again when it even becomes a pain in the a ss to find a f ucking backpack and pistol even,negative

Just take a hit,positive
Always nice to see a dev team respond to complaints by saying  we have x number of players clearly we are doing something right  Then proceed to put in microtransactions that require you to pay money before opening a loot crate that you already paid for with in game currency I ve seen other games go down this path  Wow For Honor Destiny Star Wars The next step for this unexperienced dev team will be to watch their game fall off the face of the earth Great concept that will hopefully be picked up by a accountable gaming company,negative
It s a fun game but the lag spikes and cheaters are a bit much For a game that just released this should not be acceptable but they are rank 1 regardless If this were a stock I d sell right away If they address these issues it is a beautiful thing Until then just watch the remaining survivor count If they are dying one after the other you are not about to win but you are about to be blown up die and there will be no replay available because you just got ripped If this type of thing doesn t bother you it is a great game You would probably die to a lag spike if you saw the enemy anyways This is the type of bs that makes a top game these daysI still recommend it and hope for the best because it s like this on every shooter such is the current state of PC gaming E sports lol yeah whatever The best cheater wins such is life,positive
The concept for this type of game is what makes it good but it is full of bugs and cheating I guess until a game comes out that can handle the scale of a game like this and run clean this is what we will play,negative

Amazing game Great with friends and is so much fun,positive
I usually don t play PUBG religiously only for a few weeks maybe even a month or two but I can say with full certainty that those times spent with friends are some of the funnest I ve had in a videogame Sure just like all games it gets redundant after a while but the laughs are worth it It ll take some time getting into it The recoil bullet drop and immense amount of  Oh I know what to do now  required is not something that will come overnight but learning the game makes it fun I recommed playing with friends all the time rather than solo as it truly makes differenceI have some problems though The regions are a downside for a lot of people The South African community requested servers and if I remember correctly we were only about 300 or something away from getting them Playing on EU shooting someone twice with a shotgun with them taking no damage is quite a problem Also the addition of crates which require keys is probably the stupidest part of the reward system You spend hours farming BattlePoints just to spend them on a crate which costs R30   3 to open Also this game wasn t ready for release Too many things still need fixing and after the full release I m really getting agry at these over 2GB updates every week or so From typing this about a week or two back I downloaded a 2GB update and currently a 64GB update which sometimes don t even seem to change all that much numbers are tweaked and some things are removed Quite frustratingAll in all buy it learn it and enjoy the hell out of it,positive

It pains me to say this but while PUBG is a wonderful expirence it is in no way ready for a 10 release Numerous glitches remain such as the voice glitch unable to be heard or hear other player no indicator visibvle etc add the only real world money keys and we have a package like a flat soda delicious but lacking Inconcistent hit boxes and bullet detection really sour the game  Wait for a steam sale and an update where many bugs have been fixed Best taken with some salt,positive
This game is filled with hackers Don t buy this game at all,negative
Adding loot boxes that require you to pay actual money to open it is not cool at all,negative
they added a loot bnox that you have too pay to open,negative
This game is highly addicting However it depends on the person so it may not be your type of game Gun mechanics are great but there are still many issues that the game can fix Server lag needs to be fixed and the hackers are still an issue Hit reg is ok but can use some work Overall the game is above average and I would rate it 7510,positive
As others have stated I love the game and really want to continue playing But the lag and desync seem to be getting worse and there is no communication to the players on wheter or not they will be addressing the problem with their servers and the erratic tick rate of the game I cant see myself continuing to play the game when every other round feels like ive been cheated by either an actual cheater or by the server being garbage,negative
REGION LOCK AND VPN BANS PLEASE The Hackers are getting out of hand Its making the game unplayable If not region lock then something has to detect this stuff With all that money Bluehole has made they cant make a proper anti cheat In the current state of the game dont buy dont even play it waste of time and waste of money,negative

Rip trade Rip game,negative
I love PUBG but their are too many hackers coming out of no where And the game has no anti cheat system to detect such hackers and these hackers are getting crates and sending them to their main accounts and selling crates to make money if the game is to contine to gain hackers then the game will lose popularity this will lead to angry players like me having to write angry reviews to get more attention to a big problem If you can not create anti cheat system then remove loot boxs or crates which will lead hacks to look away from the game for a time being making the game fair again until you have designed an anti cheat system And after anti cheat system is made and implementated put loot boxes and crates back in But until this is done my review will be on the no recommend side,negative

This game is a joke had only they took even the smallest fraction of their earnings and used them to repair the multiple multiple performance issues such as falling through the map taking dmg everytime you land i would maybe recommend it but despite all the performance issues with the game a large percentage of the community hack the game and blue hole has no major swing towards getting them off the servers Also note the NA Server is 97 percent asian people screaming   China 1  into the all chat,negative

Playerunkown has managed to create a game that performs terribly looks terrible feels terrible and yet is still fairly fun to playThis isn t a new phenomena Roblox is another example of games that work like this The entire game is cheaply done and cheaply made and the gameplay is fairly boring and basic yet it comes out fun to play PUBG has pretty much no soul no real character that makes it  feel like pubg  Playerunkown got mad at people for ripping off his game but non only did he not invent the battle royale genre not only did he literally take the parachuting into an island idea from a game he had previously worked on but he got the models in the game from a damn online databasePUBG is fun because battle royale is fun If you want to play a well made battle royale game with character and soul then look elsewhere Fortnite is great The Culling was great before the devs LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed it up hell even minecraft survival games has more soul than this game It s popular because the genre is popular but in the long haul it will die out to other well made games,negative

I bought this game expecting to have as much fun as all the streamers that play it religously not only is the success curve stupid high to have consistant enjoiment come from this game you have to be part of a pretty niche group of playerbase,negative

I am also a Chinese player but I m currently staying away from this game Because there are too many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing CHINESE HACKERS I feel fair about you guys  request If there is a game that make us feel shame to be a Chinese that would be definitely PUBG I feel utterly disgusted  Those LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s are not only cheating but also misbehaving no matter which sever they are in they swear at anybody who doesn t speak Chinese As Schopenhauer has said those people are good for nothing so they pretend to be patriots they isolated themselves from the rest of the world and only enjoying their CHINESE DREAM I feel so awful about that They ruinded this game Together with my friends we tried our best to escape from them but they are everywhere    not only normal players are cheating but also streamers those popular streamers also cheat in this game and they are asked to be banned from the stream platforms by many of us  yet they are not If we re region locked I will say nothing but  well done  sorry for that and may those hackers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed,negative
The game has a lot of potential I think that the devs will eventually get rid of the worst issues but at the moment it feels like it s still a bit unfinishedDo I recommend the game   Yes and no  No  is because of the multiple issues and  Yes  is because it s still a fun and addictive game to play,positive

Yeah I guess it s fun and all It can get stale after a while and new maps can t fix that I don t really know what to recommend as for new content but it s a cool concept of a game and this is my first shooter game since well ever I recommend it to users that don t crack under pressure and can take a defeat without crying themselves to death,positive
kinda complex strategies but fairly easy to learn and play good fun for endless hours,positive
PlayerUnknown won t address the big cheating issue that is going on in PUBG They  addressed  it by giving BP compensation I cashed out my cosmetics I m done with this crap,negative
PUBG definitly needs region dedicated servers there s too many people from other regions playing in NA servers making it very laggy when around said characters From what I understand as well most hackers are from the Asia region so I feel if these cheaters are stopped and the regions dedicated I will suggest this game to my friends but not till then,negative

Very fun game  It does have some bugs still but it has improved so much 1010,positive
PUBG isnt the most polished game on the market but what it lacks in visuals it makes up for in creative and entertaining game play A major shortfall of this game is that it can quickly turn into a running simulator if you decide to drop in the wrong area on the map In addition to that their is a major issue with cheating players in this game All that aside PUBG still keeps me coming back for hours and hours of game play Relatively easy learning curve Lots of guns to choose from with multiple attachments Large community of gamers to play and connect with Worth the purchase,positive
My account was bannde for no reason,negative
Good but to many chinamen,positive
The game is like any other mmo game Filled with CHEATERS and little kids who yells negativity Had hoped we could get a whole game but instead you get lag and you die in strange ways It has some good parts as well You and your friends will laugh and enjoy your But how long does it take before you get bored of al the cheating The game you love and hate,positive
Really fun game  Need a good graphics card to be remotely competitive  Had an old graphics card would land and buildings wouldnt load properly  still playable but pretty big disadvantage upgraded to a GTX1060 and it was a night and day difference,positive
Great game  however the kill cam is cancer  in ALL the replays I m not even in the picture yet getting shot and killed seems like its a killcam thing THE NEW MAP its flawed  by the time the first circle ends 30 35 players are left  Moreover it doesn t have multiple settings like the other map ,positive

90 PUBGAs a Chinese player I hope this game lock area because in this game has been the issue of racial discrimination cheating players although the largest number of Chinese players but because of the largest number of Chinese players this will inevitably happen  90  of Chinese players are very rules but I still in the game were discriminated against even being cheated cheating or killed by his teammates deliberately killed which is very affect my gaming experience because PUBG reasons or even Affect my experience in other games Chinese  cheat player  No it s just a handful of unruly people,negative

Dont buy this game Yes i play it a lot cause i have nothing else to do but dont buy it They released the game with a ton of bugs the game was rushed I get stuck in houses and behind stuff when i do a squad sometimes They still havent fixed some bugs on the main map Everything in the 10 Map sucked in my opinon the map isnt the worst i still pefer the first one This is what really got me to write the review So i was in my truck with a m24 and i hit a rock and the truck flipped over like 8 times In the new desert map all the cars suck Esept for the buggy I dont think this game should be released on xbox or even pc yet Then there are the chinese not trying to be racist but they dont speak english and the d sync just makes it so hard The hitboxes suck Then third person is just broke everyone just camps behind buildings and Uses third person to see people before they even push This game is just broken in General Please just dont buy this game,negative
I have played this game a lot and will continue playing but what bothers me is that they are using servers meant for websites to host as game servers They made about 10milj dollars in the first 2 weeks and they can t afford actual game servers I will continue playing but man the servers they suck so much The cs communuity whined that 64 tick servers aren t good enough but PUBG servers are running at 17 tick  aka it updates 17 timess,positive
I would like to recommend this game to others but theres really not enough content in the game to say its worth the money When I bought the game I thought the devs would pump out content faster than what they are but in the end they are slow and lacking Fortnite has such big updates and modes in a short amount of time PUBG looks like it can t keep up Even PUBG Mobile has more content at this point theres a really ranking system in that game also a training area to practice aim Why is this not in the PC version when you PAY FOR THE GAME THE MOBILE VERSION IS FREE This makes me want Bluehole just to give 10 cent the game so they can finish it This game isn t going to end well the way its going so far I like the game play hate the lack of content,negative
Do not buy this gameI bought this game back in Feb 2018 It worked fine till end of March after that the game sometimes would just crash and turn off my Laptop  I thought it was a heat problem but my temps never would go over 60 deg C I tried tuning everything to get it to work I could not understaned with computer stats that I have that I would have a problem running this game My computer is a i7 7700 with 1050 gtx 4gb and 16gb ram  It then worked for half of april and may then the last week of May it would crash every game  I do believe the problem lies with the patchs everytime a big patch ie over 5 gb there was a problem with it crashing The last major patch was 8gb  I also find it wierd that there are sometimes 3 4 patchs a day They also whould have these huge patchs for little fixes such as placement of weapons or addition of weapons They are most likey trying to fix the game   That shows that there are a lot of problems with the game that they are constantly fixing The surver downtime would be at prime playing time 7pst not the middle of the night   I am not happy with this game as it was paid for to only play it for 2 12 months with no problems and since I played it for more than 2 hours I can t get my money back and I am stuck with a game that might work  I run other graphic stressfull games and programs with no problems  Do not buy this game,negative

I don t know if I die from hackers or if its because I am dump so I shall just blame the old chinese hackers like everyone else I haven t played enough lately to encounter any I don t thinkDon t play much but love it when I do but it can be a laggy little slug sometimesRuns decent enough now on my old setup of a GTX780 and 16gb ram 80fps with bits like AA textures and view distance on high the other stuff that no one cares about on v lowDon t like solo as it makes me jump too muchCan also feel a little like a cross country jogging simulator if you shafted by the ringThe only game I have played where I will happily sit in a bush watching people through a 4x for 5 minutesregionlockthechinese   just jumping on the bandwagon I only have 1 chicken dinner and that was being carried in duos,positive

one of the most boring games I have ever played basically get into a match pick up items hide for and hour get sniped yeah i ll stick to more interesting games from now on glad I was able to get my money back for this piece of garbage,negative
Is a great game in all regards they just need to fix the player base and the remaining bugs  have removed many since i have been playing  Would give this a mixed review if I could because this is a very enjoyable game but every third match has some annoying hacker and they really need to fix it soon,negative
It s great in theory and just like any crazy ex   you ll fall in love with the excitement and high tension it brings out of youBut then you begin to notice the little things like how in the heat of battle   alternatively having to go into a menu screen to pick up items because the game won t let you pick it up isn t  Fun  per seOr how you ll get shot behind a wall despite the server thinking otherwiseOr how maps won t load properly at the start of the match in the critical moments you need to navigate around to pick up a weaponMaybe I ve been spoiled into believing that once you pay for a product   that it s fully functionalCall me an entitled millenial then because this clearly doesn t fit my standards,negative

First review ever I think I ve put tons of time into this game  over 500hrs as of this review and can t stand the cheater central it s become RegionLockChina is the hashtag everyone is using but I would be happier with a ping lock Region locks can be circumvented with VPNs but a ping lock will filter out anyone who can ruin a well running server with their  200ms pingAs of now I ve been playing less and less just because I don t want to deal with the cheaters but it s getting close to the point where I just put it aside for good,negative
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale game Yeah that is essentially it It is crazy fun but if you have Arma III you already have the original PUBG The only thing you are getting is one game mode that has already been around for 15 years You also get 2 nice 8x8 km maps but I do not think that is worth 30 However I loved getting back into battle royales and I REALLY like the maps They feel like they were designed for a battle royale This is an arma mod standalone done right  I am looking at you DayZ but it seems like the millions of people who bought the game don t know that you can get ARMA III for 40 with tons of other game modes with 3 cool maps for battle royale I would recommend getting ARMA III before PUBG  I would only recommend PUBG if you have 30 lying around and want to get back into battle royale I will still recommend it overall because I am judging how fun it is,positive
How a very nice and crazy game it is,positive

I truly believe this game was a waste of my time I have a upper mid range computer not great but plenty to play all other games up to this point It fits the specs required for the game but even turning around in game caused me to lag out of my mind I had a similar experience with Ark Survival but after turning down the settings the problem disappeared Needless to say the same did not happen with PUBG My several attempts in playing this game have consisted of me looting and exploring until I run into another player and my computer proceeds to freeze at 3 4 fps While I m sure this would be different if I were playing on a better computer altogether a waste of my time and money,negative
I haven t played this game nearly as much as some other people but I ve played enough to know that I CANNOT recommend this game in it s current state Every other game I land in ends with me being killed by aggregious shameless hackers eg https youtubejQVVjyDNPPkBluehole  the fact that you call this game  finished  is completely pathetic Here s an idea  instead of distributing BP bonuses that nobody gives a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about take some steps to get the hackers out of your game I understand that Chinese players make you an absurd amount of money but if you claim that you are taking player feedback into consideration you will region lock China This game is being ruined by the insane amount of hacking in this game,negative

I have spent 6 hours on the game trying to figure out how to connect to a server where I can actually play Whenever I actually connect to a game after 20 minutes with a perfect wifi and steam connection it just shows the loading screen and it plays the ingame sounds After about a minute of staring at a loading screen and listening to gunshots the whole game just crashes and says  NVIDIA has crashed  Check to see if your computer can actually play the game before you waste 30 on something where you can only wait 45 minutes just to log in and take another 20 to connect to a game where you cant even play,negative

A gret Battle Royale game it has some great mechanics and a awesomely realistic style to the way you play The guns are very satisfying to shoot and kills feel like kills This learning curve of this game gives it a much more rewarding playstyle However with Fortnite taking over the world this game is suffering i still doubt this game will die because of Fortnite It is a great game and many prefer this to Fortnite This game would probably be a 1010 if i could be bothered to get good at it  810  Awesome,positive
THIS GAME HAS ITS FAULTSIt s not optimized the way one would expect I ve got a GTX 980 get a pretty solid 50 70fps on high but experience some weird dips every now and then I personally haven t experienced any hackers most death cams have looked fairI think this game is fine to play solo but I would prefer having a friend or group of friends to play with It makes the whole experience a lot better It turns the oh this motorcykel just flipped exploded or some other weird occurency that would in singleplayer make you a bit mad into something utterly hilariousWould I in its current state recommend this to someone with a low end Desktoplaptop No not as it is now I would recommend Medium  to high end PC s7510,positive

Thrilling exciting and the best worst game in the worldGameplay is excellent when you don t  have rubberband fps drop or getting killed by a cheaterThe server and client optimazation is not existing so coming from a normal game that has been developed this game is just a slap in the faceSometimes I love this game and the next second I question everything in my life because of the huge flaws the game has,positive

I rarely review a game on Steam but after almost 300 hours of PUBG playtime I think I deserve the right to claim What s wrong with cheats on this game There are other negative aspects like the money milking craterewards system the subpar netcode and almost lack of optimization but being PUBG a PvP Shooter there are mainly 2 things that make me go mad everyday   Being killed by a cheater  autoaim minimap whatever  Being killed because grass density and character sprite is a client setting  cammo is uselessAlthough I sometimes enjoy playing it I wouldn t recommend it to new players You better try any CS or Battlefield,negative

Game is good when it works and thats the problem becouse in 910 games its dont works becouse   chinese delay abuse  cheats  more people on eu na servers are chineses than native people  realy bad servers with huge dealys crashes lags worst servers i am ever seen in any multiplayer game teleports back in time like i was playing Doctor who  when you said region lock china you are racist becouse some reason so  in this stage avoid dont buy its crap game if they dont lock servers it always will be crap crap game,negative
Anyone had the same issue i have   For some reason when i close the game  my nvidia card driver crash  right after i close a game from steam  mostly PUBG is that an issue of the game or something related to my computerBest multiplayer game ever nothing bad to say  after launch game is stable and bugfree  good fps  little strange when u have to move from normal shooter games as CS GO  COD  ETC ETC  but u get used to it  and learn how to aim properly,positive

The game will start off fun It ll take you a few matches to get the hang of how it all works becoming familiar with the map which weapons to use if you find them catching someone off guard But you ll soon come to realize that this game has a rampant cheatinghacking issue that the devs seem to not care about in the slightest So far they have refused to even set a ping lock You ll light someone up see all sorts of beautiful blood splatter yet your target doesn t die and you ve been killed A quick review on the kill cam shows that the server never even registered you hitting your targetThe furthest this company takes punishment is by banning the product key They do this because the vast majority of people banned just repurchase the game and continue to hack for another month until they are banned again I ve made it to the top 12  on solo first person pespective and can tell you that you ll play more games with hackers than without,negative
this game is awesome but i can not recommend you to buy it because its full of giltchesbugsconection problemscrashes and everything even after the full releaseSometimes i would jump off a plane and land on not loaded building and just colide with it for 3 minutes until the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game decides its time to load motherLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  texturesSometimes when the game starts it will lag to the absoulite lowest and make me go insanekeep in mind i have a gtx 1060 and an ok internet conectionLike i said game is good and fun but this is unaceptable,negative

15 Million hackers banned out of the 28 Million that bought the game math averages to 5 hackers per 100 player gameHonestly I can t recommend the game in it s current state for a few reasons   1 the Lagggggg You start rubberbanding as soon as you drop unless you drop all alone It stays that way for a good few minutes until the population goes down to around 75 80 In any other game that factor alone would be cause enough for people to never buy it unless it got fixed just look at R6 S where it s held to a much higher standard and if there s any sort of lagging or rubberbanding it is a major cause for complaint on the sub reddit   2 kinda to go along with 1 is the Hit Registration you constantly get shot around corners in cover and when the person isn t even looking at you This is due in part to the EXTREMELY LOW TICKRATE An average of 17 Hz which is even lower than Fortnite which is it s comic relief brother When PUBG is supposed to be an eventual ESports game and it can t even run better than a FREE TO PLAY game there is a problem The lowest of 8 Hz at the start and going up to around 20 Hz after the first 30 people die it is borderline unplayable in a competitive aspect  And WORST of all 3 THE GOD DAMN HACKERS Not only is this game supposed to be competitive which means you need to talk to your squad mates and support eachother  which is damn near impossible considering Chinese players outnumber Americans on the NA Servers  It almost doesn t matter when you have someone that either doesn t take any damage doesn t have any recoil  Now you can actually verify this in the replay features or they just have constant aimwall hacks Yes Battle Eye is working on it but considering the fact that Battle Eye has banned 15 MILLION PEOPLE out of the 28 MILLION PEOPLE that purchased the game as of writing this  Using Steamspy that means that on AVERAGE you are getting 5  of people you play with being hackers And that s just the amount of people Battle Eye has caught so far So ON AVERAGE you are playing with 5 HACKERS IN YOUR GAME  Unacceptable I don t honestly understand why this game is so popular and why there are so many people still buying it and for god s name why 28 Million people have wasted their money on this  game ,negative

I ve been playing this game pretty regularly for several months  I ve had my share of success I ve had my share of failure  The current iteration of this game is according to my opinion unplayable  The developers have taken a fancy toward making the game prettier adding features and including new maps as opposed to making the game actually enjoyable  In the last 3 days I ve had no less than 5 situations where I have marked confirmed hits on opponents at close range and after watching the kill cam  which confirms my hits with  blood spray  indicate that my opponent loses no health  This is unacceptableI ve uninstalled this game and will not spend any more time  beating my head against the wall  trying to get better at a game that is so broken that my best efforts are beaten by broken  mechanics,negative
All the chinc eyes be runinn de servers mang,positive
Game mechanics  710 pretty goodsmall bugs for them menurendering issues for gtx 970 4gsmall glitches that prevent aiming down sights during a battleGame play  810 damn goodnever got paired up with an all English speaking teamchinese teammateplayers tend to inadvertantly scream over the mike when shotloot crate system is good its all cosmetic not game changingThis is a good game get china their own server though Lots of hate from others about the chinese I m glad they enjoy the game too but they ruin parts of it for the rest of us when they cant speak the language of the rest of the team and obnoxiously yell over the mic8510,positive
I m tired Having the game crashed at least once a day is very annoying and definitely make the game less enjoyable It s so frustrating having played for 20 minutes and dying because of a crashUnacceptable for a game which isn t cheap at allNot to mention the cheaters and chineses trolling at every server they playI m almost giving up of this game Hope you can do something to fix it Or a lot of people are gonna leave this game like some friends of mine,negative
This is a really fun slower type of game Its probally best to play it with friends but solo s is always a challenge I enjoy this game alot and hope to see better improvements later on,positive
BETTER THAN H1Z1,positive
The games usually go like this 1 Land on ground2 Get a gun3 Run in a feild for 10 minutes4 Get a kill5 Sit in a house afk for 10 minutes6 Run in a feild for another 10 minutes7 Crawl in a feild for 10 minutes until you die or get a  CHICKEN DINNER BB There are also no english speaking people in this game The North american servers are filled with a bunch of people from asia,negative
The game added microtransactions related to loot boxes It was fun up until then but greedy developers are gonna greed I m out,negative
Needs a region lock Either lock China servers or Lock NA servers Its ruining the game Loot crates will be the death of the game BP is now worthless unless you would like to spend real money as well,negative
Intensly fun better in squads this game is so satisifying to win and completly capable of any skill level will recommend to firends for months to come,positive
It s a really good game so far Terrible gun physics 90  of the time the people that kill me aren t even close when i view it on playback That is very frustrating as it requires far less skill to actually kill someone,positive
Servers are too busy at the moment,negative
This game has kept me up late multiple times I play this game so much I hate waking up because I have work every morning and can t play this game This game hs been so good to me I ve been addicted to this game it s affected my relationship I spent so much time on this game my gf was given no attention and left me but that s ok she wasn t paying for the internet anywaysOverall amazing game but you need to regulate your usage This game will take over your life,positive
Apparently I m a racist because I don t like playing some dude In China with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pingThis game would be great if it had any other developer   this dude is a social justice warrior gone wrong and will ban any account he disagrees with or decides to do so toThen Bluehole has to fix the issue it s why so many accounts are unbanned Completely ridiculous,negative

Poorly optimized riddled with cheaters 110 would put latency threshold on server,negative
Core game is extremely fun unfortunately it is over run by china which is an issue for a squad game that could use communicationI wish they would listen to the masses of players begging for a region lockI had just bought this game and i would not recommend it entirely based on how overrun the NA servers are by chinaOtherwise game is pretty coolHopefuly another company will come out with a very similiar play game that will infact do a better job at solving this issueBut i guess this is the first game that ive seen a problem like this   Are the chinese numbers worth destroying the rest   I guess i don t know,negative
Game is still poorly optimized and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but at least the hackers are gone,positive
Terrible game full of hackers and infested with people playing out of region which 1010 are the hackers REGION LOCK THE COMMUNITY,negative
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimization  loot crates with keys good job Guess they are getting their final cash out and going the way of H1Z1,negative
The game is definitely menial and isn t really worth your money unless your friends buy it too Then maybe it s worth 999 at best because you ll only have a fun time playing matches with your friends In the event you find yourself alone in a match you ll probably be met with a flood of chinese players exploiting the high ping they have The result of said flood is a severe induction of rage and anger in the player and maybe a few broken pieces of computer hardware With that being said you really can t expect any form of communication in duos or squads PUBG started out amazingly well in early access I ve made a ton of friends and with that being said this review would have been the total opposite had I been much earlier The game currently lacks a valid playerbase to throughly enjoy I still have hope PUBG can be an amazing game It s inspired many other games of it s calibre too bad those games are PUBG s successors Fortnite is worth your money Turn your back on PUBG,negative
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server more hackers than normal players,negative
Good fun game Recently become near unplayable with an influx of hackers Also a giant influx of non English speaking players on the OC servers A great dissapointment if you were hoping to join a squads game with randoms to chat to new people I would say that 90  of the squad games I join literally have zero people speaking English with me Would not recommend until developers do something about this issue which they are tip  toeing around and refusuing to fix,negative
it was good till a week ago until they added keys witch made me lag way more this game went down hill,negative
Very nice ,positive
It has poor netcode You can be firmly behind cover and get hit Until this is fixed the game will have terrible gameplay,negative

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE est quality game I ve ever had the displeasure of playing,negative
I bounce between this and fortnite these days depending on what I m feeling at the time  The Chinese and the desync that they brought seem to have died down The hacking  Well haven t been back long enough to realy tell yet  The game is in a pretty decent state now if you want to pick it up In comparison Fortnite this game is a lot slower paced and a lot more focused on realism If I want to play something a bit slower paced and tactical I come here  If I want to run into people to kill all the time I will play Fortnite  Both have gameplay that has a very different feel from eachother and make them great to bounce between while staying in the genre  I will say though that I do prefer PUBG until I get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off during a bad game streak  Which is usually my fault,positive
if you can get over the cheaters the game is quite entertaining,positive

Edit 220118 net code is now much betterso I love this game the concept and game play are awesome but the net code is sooo bad  and the latest update2 has made it worse I cannot recommend this game to anyone until they sort the netcode after that buy it ,positive
They really need to fix the engine of the game fix it so we can have a better game please and also fix the rubber banding more please but the game is awesome,positive
Nice game but has plenty of hackers and servers are busy,positive
Got this game after my friend asked me too Loved it have almost 200 hours right now and its still fun Would recomend now after the kill game so you can report cheaters,positive
6 gb update today thought they would patch the game so it doesn t randomly crashes for me without any warning and feedback and that they would patch the parachute glitch that it closes itself 5 meters above the ground thus giving me damage even tho the game is now released but instead they added two more loot boxes,negative
Questionable developer Doesn t know the community at all nor cares,negative

Jesus So many Chinese in all server Full of Chinese peopleOf course Is not bad meeting chinese at a first timeBut They didn t  trying to communicate with other country people They trying to kill each otherIf they heard so many times of English  Then they trying to kill the people who use English Cause they hate USSingapore Thai Japanse they are good They are bad at English anyway they try to communicate with there team matesMade server For China Not the Whole Asia,negative
The game brings out a quite new and exciting gameplay You drop onto a land with others grab your gears and fight your own way out The final phase of it is extremely blood rushing and it gives you a huge feeling of accomplishment after winning it The worst part of the game is the infinite Chinese players spamming words in all chat Chinese players are invading every server and they have the largest grp of cheaters as well really giving you headaches when you try to climb up the rank A region lock will be super good Even though the game itself is not that good due to the poor graphic and number of bugs But the gun shooting of the game is really impressive and real If you ask me I definitely recommend this game for fun Its price is not high Even though the game will become boring after 150 hrs and a few wins It definitely worth the price you paid,positive

So not only was every squadduo game with an asian player  I get a loot crate with in game credits and then have to purchase a key with real money to open said crate gr8 b8 m8,negative
i have to recomend people not to buy this game its fun at first but after getting killed 50 times by flipping your bike and getting killed by hackers you get really mad at it and the developers are lazy and dont actually fix any of the issues the game has and instead makes new crates and the time in between actual updates is way to long for the money they have recieved from the massive amount of sales,negative
This game is an embarassment to the lineup of competitive strategy FPS games The graphics are horrible  I have an Nvidia GTX 1060 The movement controls and animations are painful at best and the game is seriously lacking in variety It is extremely boring and a total ripoff This is NOT WORTH 30 Honestly get CSGO or Rainbow 6Siege instead,negative
I need to download more ram to run this game on full specs,positive
This game is unplayable My controls stop working for about 30 sic and then they come back on It happens evrey 2 mins,negative
I love PUBG  BUT I will never understand why the dev is adding new content before fixinng BASIC stuff like glitches huge lags at the beginning of a game and even spawning under a map instead of a plane How can they be so unprofessional   Its just mind boggling,positive
Very good game Now its not laging at all When this game was onley 1 month in steam It was laging on the good comuters but now this game is popular and coll TY PUBG Corporation,positive
FUN BUT ITS A BROKEN POS,negative
The Chiniese cheater problem is out of control We need region locking and probably a way to prevent players from using VPNs In this state the game isn t as fun as it used to be Getting shot thru walls aim bots and things like that aren t fun for us that don t cheat But apparently I am racist for wanting to enjoy a cheat free and lag free game,negative

if you love losing to cheaters and dodgy code then buy this game if you don t then just keep looking because this game has more cheating issues than probably all the COD games together and then you also have to deal with a real dodgy job of trying to fix lag issues,negative
In principle its a good game it used to be a good game the gameplay is awesome It keeps you on the edge of your seat and paranoid Screw buying a key to unlock a crate that you earn in game Screw it with a pitchfork This is the cancer that needs to be excised from the gaming community Especially in an early access game If i could refund i would but im over the limit Microtransactions are pure cancer ebola and ghonnaherpasyphillaids combined SAY NO TO LOOT BOXES stop buying them and stop playing games locking content behind paywalls untill they realize we dont want it,negative
The biggest flaw  which may be a positive for some is the scarcity of weapons You might find yourself playing match after match being killed immediatly without a weapon which really takes the fun away considering you have to que up another match just to play again I will say it can be entertaining with a group of friends where you have more of a buffer to get some better equipment but playing solo can be very very frustrating The other obvious issue is the region locking,negative
Can t say anything bad  but I hope there will be more and more and more and more new maps  woooooo cheers to blue hole,positive
I d never have wasted my time in this buggy sluggish unoptimized piece of crap if wasn t for playing with friends,negative

The amount of hackers recently is insane Ive played 3 duos in a row all of them I was killed by a hacker it s close to unplayable,negative
You know I used to hate PUBG for the same reason as everyone else  Hackers China and Walking SimulatorHowever I had a sudden realization  PUBG was never meant to be a 100 player Battle Royale game it was MEANT to be a successor to Dayz Think about it  everything that doesn t work in PUBG would work in Dayz besides the hackers of courseThey should release a PvE version of PUBG with zombies or some other kind of enemy and it could be a really good Dayz game because of how fluent everything flowsIt just doesn t work as a BR game,negative
Fix the servers and put in a region lock,negative
I play this game when it first came out but now the quality is bad The server is so busy that I am unable to access the game It is super busy to the point where I will need to go elsewhere for my gaming entertainment And there are so much cheat going on that the game is pretty much in ruin It was great while it last,negative
The game itself is OK but the 4 hours peak maintenance is stupid like hell Zero stars,negative
The game has a lot of potential to be great In the current stages there s a lot work to be done but hopefully this game will smooth out as time goes by Would recommend buying other than the crashes and very bad lag spikes this game is worth the money   Can be very rage enducing as well so play at your own risk lolHave fun,positive
Many people complain about hackers but recently I havent seen any It seems they have actually gone down However i do have something to complain about Whenever i load into a game it takes me about 1 minute to load in Sometimes i will only load in when the plane has just dropped everyone If the game is taking up almost 100  of my GPU when in the main menu atleast make it have the maps loaded Also if i start running when im reloading with a sniper please make it where i can run at full speed I hate when the game thinks i still want to zoom in even though im running i wanna be able to run full speed Also bring back the guns at the beggining of the game or make it where everyone has one to practise shooting If i had a shooting range i could find out how much bullets actually drop Instead of wanting to test in game but knowing that if i test i will alert everyone around meIt may seem like i dont like the game but its the opposite This game is an amazing game and everyone should give it out a try,positive
The game is a blast  There is however issues with asian players connecting to North American servers The issue is mainly desync and lag issues on THEIR end The devs censor the community about this topic and even ban players from forums when the topic is brought up of region locking asian players to asian servers If there was no latency with asian players on North American servers there would be no issue at all but with all the issues it gives asian players an unfair advantage,negative
Fun game It s challange for your pc,positive
This game was so good but now is full of CHINESE CHEATERS You will get killed by one in 99  of the games and bluehole is NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT If you like this kind of game go buy fortinite or another this is UNPLAYABLE,negative
too many hackers region lock the game,negative
PUBG is an amazing game despite its buggy mechanisms region mixups and cheaters It can be frustrating at times and at times it can make you so nervous If you re up for a challenging and buggy game that has great potential this game is for you Because in the end it s all worth it for that  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner ,positive

Playerunknown is a good game with a lot of non trivial problems At its core Playerunknown gives you access to a stable set of tools and forces you to use them in new scenariosThe gunplay is consistent  loot is broadly consistent  areas that are high traffic are often high traffic and the maps are learnableAll this is then applied to where to drop and how to fight your way in and out of encroching circles It is amazing how such a simple mechanic slowly shrinking the map makes each top 10 feel new and challenging The game is fun in solos even if it does feel more luck dependent that squads or duos Squads and duos are excellent It rides a fine line between being competitive and being fun There are non trivial problems with the game but most are not gameplay related Chinese hackers are a problem especially on the NA server The game crashes albeit rarely for me a lot for something that has just undergone a full release There are bugs but increasingly few Finally rubber banding or connection issues can still cause you an undeserved deathThe frustrating thing about PlayerUnknown is that it feels like a good game When it is working it is fun to play When it isn t it feels like something designed to test patience I still recommend it but know it is not perfect,positive
I supported this game with my life before this game even came out This game its beautiful however Exploiteers in other games are managablebut PUBGyou cannot have hackers in this game  Eliminate this now PLAYERUNKNOWN or im sure this game will quickly loose its  shine  throughout its playerbase And with thatyour sweet sweet  income,negative

Truely the Battle Royal experience where anything can happen and bad luck can decend upon you to crush your chances of winning in a firefight However luck can be beaten out by playing smartKnowing and learning what you can do and what you must do is key to victoryI would recommend this game HOWEVER there is an epidemic of cheaters in this game as of writing this review Spoils the fun mid to late game if your are a good enough player barely noticable when you are a new and inexperienced As you get better in matches and place higher in the matches your odds of meeting a hacker also increases,negative
Terrible optimisation buggy so full of cheaters that you are almost guaranteed to lose to one every match and yet one of my favorite games The  rush  that most people mention in their reviews is usually immediately ruined by someone using silly cheats You end up just chasing the dragon which is the hopes that some day you will be in a server with no cheaters and that maybe one day the game will even be completed  EDIT  Yeah the cheating gets old after a while You get so excited when it is just your team and one other team and you get aim botted The devs need to do something about cheating Also if you are a cheater in this game why  It s stakeless There is no real benefit to winning You are just human trash,negative

Every match is now riddled with hacks worse than its ever been Essentially unplayable in its current state 910 of my top 5 deaths are from people aimlocking my head through a building and just hip firing away as they jump around The most rediculous so far was a guy 100 meters away jumped went prone in the air and killed me before he hit the ground I was wearing top tier gear and was barely peaking from behind a tree PUBG s anti cheat software hasnt been updated in months and reports to ban these players go unheard PUBG doesnt allow posting videos of blatant hackers on their forum and assure people that  hackers are being dealt with through the report function  There are countless videos on the web of people dying to the same hacker weeks or months apart Unless you re looking from some mindless fun and dont mind dealing with hacks I would recommend steering away from this game until PUBG developers invest in better anti cheat software it really is a waste of time if you re trying to win legit,negative
So i only have a few hrs plaied but i can tell you right off the bat dont bother till they opt the game as wellas reginlock it cant get into a game without haveing some dude with high lagg shooting me dead when on my screen not only did i shoot first but have better gun ammo and so on WAIT b4 you buy let them work on this because as it sits right now I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME,negative
Highly unrecommend Only 2 matches I can confirm i m not killed by cheaters among 20 matches in three days Disaster,negative
I can honestly say since the 10 update the game has gone downhill massivelyPros Fun to play with friends or even randoms  sometimes  Massive maps Vaulting has helped the game become better at flowing The loot system makes players more inclined to go to big cities or high value places  risk for reward Its the sort of game where you can start playing at 10 in the morning and look at your phone 5 minutes later to see its 10 at night Cons On any game except solo expect a lot of rubber banding at the start of the game Where in other games the ping between players is probably like 40 50 the servers are so bad you should expect it to be about 150 200 There are no region locks or max ping so you could have 20ms to the server while the enemy has around 200ms making PvP more luck based If you re in the top percentile of certain game modes  EU TPP solo for example expect to get put into games with cheaters very often I used to prefer third person mode but after playing so many games and running into cheaters the only way around it seems to be playing first person as they seem to avoid this If you play solo in EU squad games expect almost everybody you get teamted with to be Russian or Chinese who barely know English I would recommend playing with only people you know as team killing seems to be a normal thing with randomsIf you want to buy the game you should as it is fun especially with friends but after months of playing I am getting sick of how bad the servers are and how many cheaters have jumped into the game if they were sorted out I would play a lot more and recommend the game to everyone,negative
Don t get me wrong I love this game but there is a problem that s not being fixed CHINESE CHEATERS and CHINESE LAGGERSThe game offers a report option that you can use with death cams but that is not fixing the problem But that s not fixing anything They will be banned  I hope and they will buy the game again on a different smurf account netting more money to the companyThey are infesting all servers NA SA EU hell you ll probably never gon on a match without a Chinese dude there to lag or cheat Why not region  ping lock them  We need a more proactive cheat protection because by the time you report a cheater they ll have already killed you and spoiled all the funThis is my major problem with the game and until it get s fixed I m going to leave my review as negative,negative

DON T BOTHER  just not worth the damn time right now probably not everUpdate  I am having far more crashes since release than I ever had in early access this is a poor show of developmentFurther edit  This is not even ready to be out of alpha It s buggy as all hell the mechanics DON T WORK the latency is not in any way managed the vehicles and melee feel like a 5 year old made them and yet somehow this is allowed to be marketed as a fully releasded gameOh and incase you hadn t heard the anti cheat is completely worthless and may as well be a guy standing in the lobby saying play fair,negative

It s a shame this game was first done to such succes by a studio that does not have the capacity to run a game to a satisfying experience The gameplay and design are great but the terrible servers and buggy software keeps the game from being anythiny more than a frustrating mess In the current state I would reccomend playing a different game until a better studio picks up the concept and creates something that can be called a game,negative
Game is ridiculously buggy and filled to the brim with hackers Played a few games where everybody dies at round start and probably 50 others where I get killed by some Chinese guy using aimbot If you are someone thinking about buying this game do yourself a favor and don t Not a good game in its current state,negative

I really do enjoy this game a lot and will continue to play it But I just can t recommend it to anybody right now Even after being officially released the game is still full of bugs and server lag is still VERY bad sometimes I have great internet connection and I still get the  Network Lag Detected  screen from time to time The looting system is so bad in this game too you have to be extremely lucky to find something before someone else kills you As of now the servers are flooded with Chinese players and there are A LOT of hackers People are using Aimbot wall hacks and all that other bs Its gotten to the point where I die by a hacker almost every game I play And I know the difference between someone with good aim and someone that s just straight up using aimbot to kill me and my friend I even have video evidence to show off all the times that I died by hackers So to those who are fairly interested in this game I say stay away from this game for now Wait for the devs to get rid of the hackers and update the game more,negative
Was fun with friends game engine needs major work but thats not the biggest flaw Played for over 100 hours probs about 200   300 matches and then i boot up my pc one day and get a warning im banned  No reason at all behind this probably just some algorithm that decided it Game developers made their money and are now letting the game fall apart kinda sad but thats just how games are now a days 310 expirence,negative
Too many cheatershackers  The developers do not seem to care much about fixing them or there arent enough developers to keep up with all of the issues  Most matches you play if you pay attention you can notice cheaters  To name a few cheats happening  aim bot speed hack esp no recoil macros lag switching people modifying files to remove grass rocks and bushes On top of that you have issues with damage bugs and server tick ratenetcode issues  The sad part is it keeps getting worse  It doesnt seem like the main issues which are above are being dealt with  People will suggest playing first person but the issues are still there  There might be less aimbot users but the other issues still apply to first person as wellIts sad because if the issues above were fixed or even reduced to where you could play a few games with out seeing them then the game would be fun enough to play  At the moment I wouldnt suggest spending the money until the issues are dealt withIts really a big headache and will make your blood pressure rise,negative

Game is great if you have a decent pc The game has a lot of freedom and it s a ton of fun playing with my friends It s the first battle royale game that was made well Overwell this game is great if you have a pretty good computer if not than it s laggy,positive
I recommand you guys to play this game its one of the best game in 2017,positive
I have put over 1000 hours into this game It WAS great The blatant hacks being used now on nearly every match you enter is annoying to say the least I would recommend this game if they implemented  Dare I say a region lock This is not me being xenophobic When the creator of the game states most of the cheats are coming from China Well seal them to play with other cheaters Or perhaps it s just a money grab for them now Ban someone and they instantly purchuse a new copy of the game after they are able to sell loot they have recieved from the numerous crates they are earning This legitimately was my favorite game to play They rounds that drop faster due to velocity and size being able to jump right into a new match after dying and the game play in general are amazing,negative
Almost 800 hours on this game playing since Day 1 And all I can is it s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing garbage This game is filled with consistant D SyncLagDying behind wallsHorrible RNG etc etcGames last 30 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing minutes and are only really fun if you drop school or pecado and manage to pick up a gun before the person beside you does Searching for a game takes about a minute now and loading in and waiting is another minute It s so tedious to go through that process again and again especially if you die near the beginning of the game Also the game is NOT region locked because its xenophobic for us NA players want to have communication with our randomly picked teammates from china who have no recoil cheats walls esp etc etc More than 20  of this game is cheaters it s like the game has no anti cheat at this point Fortnite a free to play game has less cheaters than this peice of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Furthermore the only reason I m playing this game and continuing to play it is to make money off these clothes lol,negative
Only 12 hours in and im loving this game Havent met a single hacker so i think some of the negative reviews are just hopping on that band wagon I really enjoy random squad play and have met some great people doing it Just wish it was easier to add people to play with again Great game here give it a shot,positive

Very good game to play with friends But might cause a bit of rage every now and then because of some glitches But overall I think PUBG is a very good game,positive
This is a great game absolutley amazing Until the new update It has been running like crap and I m finding new glitches every few games The new map also isn t that interesting and doesn t support as many play styles It is still a great game though even with these annoying parts,positive

A good game ruined by hackers bad performance and shady developers That is all there is to it and until they can make a proper anti cheat I will give it a thumbs up It is near impossible to get into a game and win because there is always some sort of hacker,negative
One of my all time favorite games that i have ever played love the game and it is incredibly fun to play with friends,positive
Probably the best concept for a game with sub par execution It has continued to get better regardless of what the community says since I bought the game almost a year ago Don t buy this game expecting a AAA polished masterpiece it s not there yet and I m not sure it will ever really be It s a 30 game that I can personally say Ive put more time into than the rest of my steam libary combined,positive
This is a good game,positive
Better now in  its later stages Could still benefit from some optimisation but still a fun game,positive
The game is kinda buggy You lose a lot of fps when you are landing at a place with many players It can be fun with friends and if you are a god at the videogame You should buy it if you have a good pc  GTX 1080,positive

Servers are awful,negative
does not work if you have an ultra wide monitor  the settings dont allow you to optimize for your monitor crap,negative
Hmm An interesting oneNow the game is griipping and there s a reason why most players have hundreds of hours in it but for a supposedly 11 release this game is not finished and it s wrong that they claim it isI also take issue with the fact that the creator claimed that modding would be a part of this game and all he apparently meant by that was some people could host custom games where you can tweak some incredibly minor settings of the gameHackers are a MAJOR issue at present in this game and PLAYERUNKNOWN is acting a bit foolish in my opinion not addressing the fact that 99  are coming from China  his own statistic not mine yet he is unwilling to region lock the game add a reasonable ping tolerance or create  Worldwide  server choices for players He s essentiallyu said there is a problem and the solution is xenephobic which is just lunacy in my opinion but there we goHowever I can t claim I haven t got my money s worth   literally more than that actually considering the money i have made off of crate sales Great action fun moments and addictive format,positive

This game starts out fun but once the novelty wears of youll realise its pretty bad Its very buggy and poorly made and the oceanic servers are infested with asians of which id say half are hacking I honestly wouldnt recomend this game to anyone the only reason i still have it installed is most of my freinds are still riding the hype train This is all entirley my own opinion i understand and respect the fact many will disagree with me,negative
too laggy,negative
This game is super laggy and unfair It likes to crash midgame normally Sometimes it wont let you shoot Sometimes you get stuck and you cant move This game is unfair and buggy not worth 30 DO NOT BUY The creators of this game really need to work on these bugs Do not buy this game,negative

Bluehole simply lack the skill or knowledge to make a FPS It s hard to have fun or recommend a game that has so many problems How or why is one country allowed to flood any and all servers with the dev doing nothing about it  That s simply idiotic to even let something like that happenGame had potential but those days have passed Game has basic issues that should have been fixed in alpha stage but this is the final product release a broken game terrible servers lag cause of Chinese players cheating so ramptant because of one country  China No other game would be toleratedIt s only a matter of time before a real gaming company makes a Battle Royal gamemod The game itself is horrible the mode is what people want Other devs will make and can make it as PUBG doesn t own nor can they own the mode,negative
This is one of the most fun multiplayer games to come out in the last few yearsIt s not for everybody and this game had a pretty rocky road through early access to get it to release  But now with 10 out they have delivered on all their promises and you have a fairly complete game with easily hundreds of hours of play without it getting old  Once you survive the early game every pubg game is different  made even more memorable through the replay system where you can watch back how it played out  Most games end up being more about the journey and not the destination as 95  of your games will end with you suddenly getting shot by a guy or squad that you didn t see in time  But for that 5  where you make it to the final few left Man There is nothing else like it in gaming right now  I ve never played a game that could give me as consistently high an adrenaline rush in the late game like this one  Once you get confident enough to not only survive until the late game and be able to do more than just hide that s where the game really shines  The final moments where you  and your squad mates are barely even breathing because its so intense right up until the point where you get the final kill is downright cathartic usually in a collective cheer and sigh of relief followed by  one more game  If you have gotten good with other shooters be aware that this game does have a pretty big learning curve with both combat game sense and even parachuting tactics towards the beginning of the game  There are not many opportunities to get comfortable with the combat enough to get a handle of each gun s recoil and bullet drop and so it takes a bit of time to get used to each weapon  Also it will be frustrating at first when it always seems like someone finds a gun before you do and ends up shooting you before you get to do anything  Once you get better at parachuting and quick thinking with regard to where to loot that type of game will happen less and lessIt s a really intense game in solo but its made even better in duo and squad game modes particularly if you have friends to play with  the in game chat usually features lots of spam which leads most people to use programs like Discord for game chat  The duo and squad games I think have the most replayablilityThe only major issues I ve had with the game are early game lag and buggy vehicle controls particularly with the bikes which have a tendency to flip and glitch out on the terrain either damaging or killing its drivers most of the time  The red zones are also a bit of a pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE  as a game mechanic but I suppose keeps the game interesting with a little element of randomness  Also I have only ever encountered a few hackers  which are easy to spot through the death cam and replay functions but then again I play on mostly first person servers and the hackers tend to prefer the third person ones  The UI can also be a little buggy particularly with the menus as it often doesn t always show friends online that should be online making it difficult to get people into the party  The loot boxes in the game are also pretty laughable which each box containing one really dull pair of clothing that you don t want anyways  I ve opted to selling them on the steam market rather than opening them and have ended up making up all the money I paid for this game and then some which is really a plusOverall there is a reason why this is one of the most played games out right now  Once you get past the learning curve its a fun thrilling and endlessly frustrating experience  in an oddly good way that always makes you keep coming back for more  Battle Royale as a game genre may have existed in some form before this game but this is really the first game that really made it a thing  It s a new fresh experience after a relentless onslaught of rehashed fight die respawn fight die respawn first person shooters like the Battlefield and Call of Duty series which I ve honestly gotten bored of  The gameplay in PUBG feels a lot more fleshed out where each game feels like its own small adventure until they inevitably end with you getting unceremoniously shot in the back of the head or finally getting that sweet Winner Winner Chicken Dinner,positive
I love this gameUntil I get shot from across the map by a Chinese hacker,negative

I only have this because everyone else has it,positive
I m harsh with it but i d rather say  I do not recommend this game YET  I personnally have plenty of things to hate on this game the base concept is awesome and the spread mechanic for players and weapons is neat same for the zone red areas and care packagesThe bad things they really should work on  The way their server and our client communicate I often find myself shooting the head of my enemy only to realise I am not my connection is not the issue since I run around 80Mbps download and often have a ping of around 5mbps in most other games We should be able to cancel some interactions like climbing The game is not fluid you must make ONE action at the time and it is incredibly frustrating not being able to shoot during some small actions that require an incredible amount of time like opening doors crouching getting an item and even aiming seems to take a bit of time in which you cant shoot I often seem to notice there s some sort of delay when trying to shoot aim move make an action in general fokken hackers everywhere and I swear the god there s a lot of em,negative
Need to do more to combat hackers ruining this great game,positive
I need an explanation I did not open the cheat software why I will be banned permanently vac I need a formal reason,negative
Yeah nah yeah good ay yeah,positive
Seriously great game but dont bother buying it until they fix the hacker problem   becomes seriously unfun when you drop from the plane only to have someone headshot all of the field while standing in a room shooting through walls in all directionsEither region lock China as 99  of the hackers have chinese names and are advertising the hacks in game or remove the ability to sell items  crates on steam so there is no incentive to hack in order to make cash I can only assume this is why they are doing it as some rare items are probably worth more than a months wagesDevelopers are apoligetic but appear to do nothing meaningful to stop the rampart hacking issues  why would they  they make more money after banning in large rounds only to have offending players rebuy the game to continue the cycle,negative
This game has been fun at sometimes but for the most part when Im getting shot from a distance I cant tell from which direction the shots are coming from and Im left confused There is constant lags through out the game play and unfair gun fights Please fix this game so I can actually enjoy it,negative
Love this game Definitely one of the best of 2017 Best played with friends in Duo or Squad matches but even Solo is always exciting New Desert map is really fun and I love how much dedication the developers put into creating an entire new environment from the original map I am very much looking forward to the next new Winter map 300hrs logged so far with more counting up every day I actually skipped getting this the first few months after it released because I didn t want to play yet another depressing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game but man was I wrong about this one and wish I had supported this project from day 1 Stop reading this and buy it already so that you can enjoy the HYPE too,positive
Rampant cheating and invasion by Chinese players to NA EU and OC servers ruines play   by massive I mean you are very likely to meet a hacker in almost every game you playOnce ping lock  region lock is in place and a very strong anti cheat system put in then thumbs up  Until then it s a sad waste of time to try,negative

small bugs but can easily deal with it,positive
I LOVE this game,positive
its the best so fun,positive
Such a Great Game I love it overall i rate it a 5,positive
Upon playing this game for around 40 hours I honestly can t recommend this game Perhaps it is the servers or glitchesbugs or poor optimization Or perhaps this just isn t my type of game I am in dire need of the return of a team based tps like SOCOM You loot for 10 minutes You runwalkdrive your way to the circle You wait a few more minutes being patient Then you get your head blown off 25 minutes later and 25 minutes wasted Bring back SOCOM on the Playstation 4 with a Dualshock and I will invest thousands and thousands of hours into it This game just isn t for me   ,negative
Overall a decent game but it should not of been pushed to full release as the game still has many things to fix very buggy and hacking is rampant throughout the game Pubg also needs to be region locked as many chinese players are playing on north american servers causing desync and many of them hacking,negative
I havent played this game for a long time at all and i have already meet a hacker,negative
It s a great game for the most part The new  Desert  map is not as fun as the original in my opinion The reason being is because there are many pits that you are able to fall in and get stuck there It s very open and it seems like it is bigger than the old one so it s usually hard to find other players All in all it s a neat game,positive
After 10 the game still has low fps  even with everything in very low lags a lot of hacks and bugs,negative
too many asian hackers regoin lock please,negative
We are all playing this because there is nothing else to play It s entertaining for sure but for all the wrong reasonsDon t buy this trash game For the reasons as follows  Mongol Hordes Moon physics Eunuchs  Hackers  Network lag detected  Picking up the same thing 10x before you get it Random crashes and system lock ups Terrible lag and desync Unresponsive controls Inconsistant damage done by weapons Vehicles launched into space by small bumps You will often die from all of the above,negative

This game is extremely fun and could even be competitive but every other game is just filled with hackers Mostly foreign hackers too I don t know why most hackers are foreign but it just seems to be that way It completely sucks looting for the first 10 mintues just to get shot from the top of gatka to prison by a kar 98 from a hacker who was clearly just shooting at the ground,negative

Before anything else I want to state this I love this game I think it s the best battleroyal game But as of a few days ago from the time of writing this review the game has been INFESTED with hackers I don t mean seeing a few a day I mean seeing a hacker in nearly every lobby It is so bad that my whole squad was wiped out by one guy with an red dot on a m4a1 from 200 meters away THROUGH WALLS BUILDINGS AND HILLS Plus ontop of that It s infested with Asian LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s NO MATTER WHAT SERVER YOU RE ON This goes with the hackers aswell But wait There s more This game also has horrid loading times Sometimes I ll be on a black screen untill a few moments after touching the ground sometimes I ll have landed and the loot andor building will have not loaded in for a while which leads to my death I don t have some potato either Overall the game itself is great but it is currently unplayable and mostly unenjoyable because of these reasons,negative

PUBG Corp  Bluehole seem to care more about maintaining the revenue stream from Chinese hackers than putting in real solutions to make the game better When ping locks or region locks are implemented this game might be playable but for now I run into hackers in 9 out of 10 games No more thanksAdditionally they are very silent on network performance instead claiming any performance issues are due to the engine or their implementation It s very obvious from network analysis that the game servers are struggling to provide stable updates at the best of times This is probably why it s one of the only FPS games in this category without a network performance overlay,negative

All you need to know is this the creator of this game knows of a way to eliminate 99 percent of cheaters and has made a conscious decision not to He s on record that 99 percent of cheaters come out of China yet he will not implement region lock In other words he s purposely letting cheaters play as frequently as they want because he s afraid his sales in China will go down if he doesn t He claims his  top priority  is to eliminate cheating yet if this were true there s a very easy way to eliminate 99 percent of thema way he refuses to consider If this sounds like someone you want to give your money to have at it All talk of eliminating cheaters is nothing more than marketing fluff He needs prospective buyers to believe he actually cares about stopping cheaters so he blatantly lies about doing so Please don t fall for this pathetic marketing gimmick The facts are the facts he can eliminate 99 percent of cheaters and has already said he won t be doing soAlso the game  is an un optimized mess with horrific servers The game is no more optimized now than it was on day 1 and the servers are just as bad as well The only thing that matters server performance and optimization are pure trash and haven t been improved in any significant way In Summary 1 Un optimized2 Very poor server performance3 Cheaters   a lot of them   and the creator of the game refuses to do a thing about it,negative
A Binary Experience  Stellar at its best atrocious at its worst I would be lying if I denied having an extraordinary amount of fun with this game Nothing quite beats the experience of teaming up with 1 3 friends and undergoing a prolongued fight to the death against strangers When everything works properly and everything s fair the game s an unrivaled masterpiece that I couldn t recommend buying enoughUnfortunately not every game goes that way It seems recently that fewer and fewer do When I first started playing in early access  in Spring of 2017 the game had its problems but cheaters didn t seem to be one of them I can t recall ever encountering a hacker Now it seems like half the games I play end with being killed by someone blatantly and shamelessly cheating The addition of the deathcam allows you to watch your killer end your game and when they ve done it unfairly you can tell It happens a lot way more often than it should Scores of players from Asia flood the North American servers  and vice versa presumably to abuse ping for an immediate and tangible advantage  hacks or not this still gives them an unfair advantage that can t be countered Being killed by a cheater who s halfway across the world is an extremely frustrating experienceThe game is a lot of fun but until region lock and a better anti cheat system are implemented I can t recommend it Every match you enter is just a gamble as to whether or not you ll be killed by a hacker regardless of your skill and experience So why bother ,negative
One of my favourite games,positive
I see an end of this awesome game and that end is called hacker  4 free game,negative
edit ok so I played the game s  War Mode  and boy lemme tell ya it sucksits Blue Hole s poor attempt at a dare i say it Call of Duty style gameplay By making 10 teams of 10 people they put you in an enclosed circle in a shootout spawing takes 30 40 seconds people camp  not surprised you re forced into 1 area of the map people leave CONSTANTLY and its all around not fun in all seriousness we are witnessing the game crap the bed in an ever flowing fountain of feces 1010,negative

I used to like the game nut since its release bugs and lags have not been fixed I still feel like there are not enough weapons but the worst thing BY FAR about this game are the hackers THERE ARE HACKERS ALMOST EVERY SINGLE GAME and bluehole seems to do nothing about it Big disappointment,negative
It seems its still on BetaAlpha stage Buggy without no constant udpate Hackers are widespread as well without no anti cheat implemented They are relying on people s report Chinese are over filling the other servers and are constant hackers as wellDo you recommend this game  No for me,negative

I have no problem with the game and enjoy it a lotI havn t encountered any cheater in 22h of gameplay i had at the time i wrote this review have great performance at 60fps capped  low mid but still looks wonderful  only the first game the textures takes a couple minutes to load bc of 2Gb vram and almost full 2yo hdd and since the 10 update the game is even better I am part of the ones who do not have anything against pubg how wonderful is that config   rog G20cbi5 64008gb ddr4GTX 960 2Gb1To HDD6mbps broadband at bestyou should really buy it if you want to don t be afraid by the reviews nor the forums the game is wonderfuli played a lot of fps and all and i really enjoy this game and have been playing a lot since i bought it don t hesitate and if you didn t like it get a refund,positive
Not polished in its current state but thats not the reason for a big thumbs down A grotesque amount of hackers over many months have ruined any joy I once felt playing this great game,negative
Such overrated boring crap All you do is loot wait loot and deal with cheaters and bugs I don t get they hype when there s so many better shooters to play Would not recomend,negative
Simply don t buy Take it from someone that has put too many hours into the gameHacker fest on top of poor optimization and networking created by company that rather release weaponclothing paid crates than actually fix the issues that the community has been pointing out for over six months Fix networkig issues and optimize the game    here s weapon skins Fix the hacker issue    here s a new map,negative
Great game that has become nothing more than a platform for chinese players to use cheats on The devs want that chinese money so refuse to do the one thing that would remove 999  of cheat users,negative
The hacking especially at the hours I usually play  10pm 2am PDT has become so incredibly common that it is rare to die from normal players The last three games I was killed by hackers EASILY verified from the killcam  Kinda a giveaway when someone kills you with an UZI from 200 meters away with zero misses with ONE burst It has gotten to the point for me I can no longer play the game It just isnt enjoyable I m done feeding the trolls at this juncture Im sure Bluehole doesnt give a      though since they already have our money If they are making any attempt to curb the hacking they are failing miserablyAt first it was rare enough to shrug off Not anymore,negative
I was hesitant to buy this game 3 months ago but quickly fell in love with it There are tons of great concepts about this game and with each patch it gets improved Even the short amount of time ive been playing its night and day to how to the game preforms since when I first started It has a very steep learning curve and is extremely hard in the begining No aim assist each gun performs different love the ability to have different play styles  rambo or more strategic finally getting your first chicken dinner is an amazing feeling Watching yourself improve throughout the weeks feels awesome Yes it still has a lot of tweaking to do as it has its glitches and annoyingly loud LOVE LOVE LOVE  bombs every 5 secs but its just an awesome game with so much room for improvement still Over the last 2 weeks my love for this game has ended its just not playable anymore Tonight after about an 6 hour session ive finally had enough The game is just full of hackers now over the last 2 4 weeks ive seen suspicious shots on me that i brushed off as luck or crazy skill getting headshot from 2 400 meters away by an AR that was shooting at fully auto It happened a couple times but tyically not more than once a night I shrugged it off and kept grinding The last 2 nights of playing tonight specifically it has gone from the occasional macro abuser to just blantant hacking getting shot by people through walls through trees i mean they arnt even pretending anymore The game allows replays it has deathcams it shows them just standing in building and auto fireing through the wall then bam player has killed me with a headshot 99  of these hackers and macro recoil users all have chinese names too its not a coincidence The asian invasion on NA servers are just too much especially if most of them are hacking out of the 6 hours i put in tonight about 20 games total I was wall hacked by 6 people auto macro d another 7 times I have all the recordings Its absolutely ridiculous to play this game anymore hackers will always find a way but when its to this extreme where literally 4 5 players in each game are hacking its just no good Im done until it gets fixed,negative
This game is a lot of fun with friends and could be great if they fix the things that actuallly matter1 Cheaters are absolutely out of control in this game Any given game has a 50  chance of having a Chinese hacker or 5 in it Nothing like playing through the entire round getting 6 kills only to be killed by a UMP headshot from over a kilometer away while in a building behind a wallBluehole refuse to region lock the Chinese players to their own server and allow them to rampantly cheat on every server ruining all of them completely2 The net code in this game is an absolute amateur joke Refreshrate of 17hz is laughable Be ready to lag frequently and die to bullets 2 seconds after ducking back behind coverHonestly don t waste your money on this game if you have not purchased it yet Bluehole have shown no real determination to fix the hacking or the brutal online performance of their game and are now trying to get it onto PS4 Thank god Sony shut that down Maybe now they will focus their efforts on fixing the massive problems instead of worrying about selling more copies in another pllatform,negative
Uninstalled the game because it literally started to break my friends PC while my other friend was bugging out and lagging out Meanwhile i cant even get into a match because the second it starts id still be in the lobby No point in playing a bugged out game that your friends cant even get into Have nearly 50 hours in the game most of which i spent being LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off No idea why i subjucated myself to it maybe cause there were fun moments in it WIth all the hackers and Chinese speaking players  Kinda hard to coordinate when you cant speak the guys language the game is broken and not worth buying If i could get a refund id get one,negative

Do not buy this game if you want to win or have a competitive experience The Oceanic servers are riddled with hackers from Asia  mostly and the game is still buggy and needs improvement It can however be an enjoyable experience if played with friends and doing fun challenges like pistols only etc The loot system is also an incredibly irritating part of the game at times and if you do not like games that require luck then this game is not for you You may drop in a city and loot 5 houses and get nothing but a pistol whereas your opponents may visit 1 2 houses and get an AKM  armour and instantly destroy youOverall the game needs a massive improvement and focus needs to be put into the game s inadequate servers optimisation and cheaters If you are looking to buy this game I would wait until a good change is made that does not make it feel like a waste of space on your Steam Library,negative
Game has turned into who has the best cheats Chinese name  check aimbot  check wallhacks  check It s no longer fun to play against a cheater every other game NA TPP is more like North Asia now Wait for a region lock or ping lock before buying this game Too frustrating to lose against a cheater,negative

To interested player  This game was great until a few weeks ago Hackers are in every single game name now You literally have no chance to win or kill someone  unless they happen to be the 1  not hacking PUBG says that they are banning hackers but I wouldn t know Hell it s gotten worse since they said they  banned 6 million hackers  It s unfortunate because it was one of the best games I ve played in awhile I would recommend but not in this hacked state If anything changes I ll update the reviewTo PUBG  Fix the banning system The fact you can only report the player that killed you is dumb Also if a player gets too many reports within a timeframe put their account on hold until it can be reviewed Institute ping lock and region lock Come off of your high horse and get help from other gaming companies I realize this is a difficult aspect of the game to fix but come on Give us something to work with You had a great game let s get it back,negative

I ve played this game for a little while from what I can see it has potential and I m excited for the future But with that being said there are problems A region lock would be nice that would get rid of all the people from the Chinese servers screaming out racial slurs with an accent thicker than a 10 inch wide steel block The rubber banding needs to be addressed there have been some games where if I tried to move I d be rubber banded back to the same spot for a solid 6 minutes I know it may not seem like a lot but 6 minutes in this game can mean possible life and death When you have to use the time you have to loot and either fight other players or escape it s being taken up by you being shot back to the spot you were in I ve learned to just deal with it at this point but it needs to go I ve seen hackers on other servers and so far not much has been done about it There needs to be something put in place that severely effects cheaters on the game to disencourage cheating on this game Other than that the game is fine and it plays well though you might need a pretty beefy gaming rig to play it The optimization has gotten much better from the pre release version of the game That s all I have to say about it I look forward to seeing where this game will go,positive
Great last manteam standing game and it s fun to play with friendsThe only minus is the people using hacks but this will probably be fixed when its fully released,positive
This game does a lot of things right It gives you that intense survival experience where every building is a chance to find that precious loot you re desperately searching for Every town has a chance to be occupied Every corner could have the enemy hiding behind it Every shot you fire could alert the enemy to your presence I absolutely love this survival feeling and it s what keeps me coming back to try for that sweet chicken dinner The shooting mechanics are tight and you rarely go an entire game without finding some kind of decent weapon Despite how much I love dropping in with a squad of friends and fighting for that sweet chicken dinner there is one part of this game that absolutely ruins it for me Hackers I cannot count how many times I have been killed and lost games due to someone hacking In fact this review is a direct result of being killed by a hacker who was not only aimbotting but was shooting and killing everyone in town from inside a hall way Being killed by a hacker completely ruins the mood and my friends and I often stop playing for the night after such an encounter I recommend sticking to first person mode as it seems less littered by hackers In fact I d say stay completely away from third person until Bluehole does SOMETHING to combat the immense amount of hackers polluting and ruining the game,negative
This game has seen major impovrements since the game was first released A ton of bug fixes new map better hitboxes game mechanic tweaks weapon and damage development Desync and server side lag has been greatly reduced But throughout the entirety of this games life it has never seen a single improvement in hackers We hear about 15 million players banned for hacking but there hasn t been a single bit of effective hack prevention This game has easily exploitable clientside features that affects the gameplay of the rest of the players  ie  buildings not registering on the client allowing the player to drive or shoot through walls that would otherwise be there for everyone else I cannot reccomend that anyone buys this game until they add a worthy anti cheat system The bans that they do dish out aren t even handled via VAC so it s pretty meaningless The game developers also think that making their boxes require keys  paid keys to open is going to combat the amount of hackers playing specifically to sell their loot boxes Paid content in a paid game Also this may no be a problem for most but I think region locked servers should be a thing Being in NA I do not want to be playing with countries on the otherside of the world I feel this adds to the possible desync and lag not to mention most of the hacker ban are from China,negative
infinite replay value love this game Takes a bit of getting used to though a few hours of getting no kills should just about do it,positive
AFTER THE 10 PATCH RELEASE THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE,positive
This game is probally the worst inception to the human kind right above Obama becoming president The fact that the devs neglect to fix ANY of the actual isses that this game ACTUALLY occur and happens 247 IE crashes all the time hit boxes are pure trash hackers can be found in every single game the asian population infects the NA servers more then the japs did in the battle of pearl harbor The fact that they took time to take out crouch jumping  which is in every shooter game in the world to add vaulting which is probally the worst mechanic in this game other then the fact that ghost bullets are still a thing How can a company that made and is worth 47 billion dollars now create such a horrible game  they need to focus more on the fact that people can shoot us through rocks and mountains instead of adding RPM gauges and the animation of looking behind you while going in reverse This game has potential but with all this REOCCURING issues I would never reccomend this game to anyone Even tho ive put almost 700 hours in this game For once fix the issues we are telling you about please and thank you  ,negative
I loved this game when i first got it the fights were all fair i can understand where i was getting killed from and what it took for me to kill others graphics are great and good range of weapons to choose fromHowever due to recent and increasing amounts of people using hacks to advance in this game has made this game horrible to enjoy now until issues are resolved its highly unlikely ill be playing this game,negative
its alright,positive
I have a good amount of hours on this game I ve been playing this forever and it s annoying that there are so many hackers on this game The game is extremely fun when youre playing duo or squad with friends but if its not friends or youre solo its either chinese people you dont freaking understand or team killers and if you play solo it s extremely boring I suggest playing with friends you knowThere are SO freaking many hackers when you get a good game youve got that kar98k that 8x sr supressor cheek pad m416 with all the ammo and attachtments needed level 3 EVERYTHING a 4x and a red dot But then a hacker shows up in the final 5 and you die,negative

This could be a good game if it wasn t riddled with hackers from my experience there s at least a 33  chance that there is a hacker in the game Don t purchase this until they improve their anti cheat methods 410,negative
Hackers hackers and more hackers The last 4 rounds I played with my squad the  players alive  count was reduced down to about 25 people within the first 2 minutes My squad inside our own individual buildings proceeded to be headshot one by one by the same person The killfeeds  which show how the other player killed you now mainly consist of people randomly firing automatic weapons into the air in your general location which results in them headshotting you and your entire squad The developers are perfectly content with allowing hackers to ruin this game because when they ban a hacker they don t ban their computers   only their accounts This means that banning a hacker will allow them to repurchase the game and continue to play so long as they create a new steam account which results in them getting more revenue from hackers buying the game over and over I ll be getting a new game soon and my entire squad has vowed to quit alongside me so we can all join up and play a game that we can actually enjoy and win fairly Enjoy the millions you made Bluehole   it is all about profit and the bottom line after all Not customer satisfaction,negative
Even though PUGB 10 came out 20 days ago It still has almost the same bugs and glitches it had before 10 came out They fixed some of them such as  general sound effects of the cars and red zone Fixed some of them to a certain extent  rubberbanding is still happening Not as often but it is still in the game  fences if that can be called a fix  optimization has gotten better but they still have a looong way to go And then you have all the other problems such as  initial lag chinese hackers cars getting stuck and exploding killing you in the process and a long etceteraAll in all I am still waiting for the developers to fix these problems some of which have been in the game for more than 5 months Nonetheless I will keep playing until a more refined BatteRoyale comes out It is a fun game but dying due to these problems gets on your nerves,negative

Great game but the ammount of hackers currently playing make me want to refund the game Over 50  of all matches play have a cheater Add region lock,negative
I have no idea what they did to the game According to leaderboards I m in the top 2  on solo in NA servers The ballistics changes don t account for the incredible decline in accuracy I used to love this game I used to be decent Not amazing but pretty good Ever since 10 I hit about 20  of the shots I used to and almost every game I ll be shooting at someone crosshair directly on them at 100m shoot 10 times and get 0 hitsIf I just sucked at the game I d be like okay I m just not good I suck at a lot of games But before 10 guns felt relatively reliable I knew that if I put my crosshair on my target and shot I d hit them Now all this game does is frustrate meI don t know what they did but they 100  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing broke shooting in this game Why anyone thought it was a good design decision to make guns never ever ever shoot where you aim them is lost on me,negative
Great game terrrible cheating They say they banned X amount of players yet every game there is guys shooting through walls aimbots and people who only speak chinese on every server might come back if the cheating is fixed,negative

Almost every game is dominated by hackers who can shoot across maps and through buildings  The game has become unplayable and the issue has only gotten worse over time  I will not recommend this game and will not buy future games from this company based on the overall lack of support or corrective action  Save your money and buy a playable game,negative
PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds Battle Royale Jumping out of planes parachuting into a vast empty state with many great loot and weapon options everywhere Claiming loot before the 100 other players just like you Sharing attachments with friends or hording them all for yourself just in case you get that Kar 98k What s not to like The physics of PUBG are amazing Without a doubt the best FPSTPS experience I have had among the genre recently Occasionally the vehicles glitch but I m sure that will be fixed soon My biggest request recently would be adding an offline play mode with AI as your opponents This would be great for playing when the servers are down or when you are just trying to figure some basic things outThe biggest issue I ve had with the game is the amount of cheaters who have surfaced with the official release of the game Until the game was officially released it was great fun to hop into a game with friends or by yourself and fight shoot and claw your way to getting that Chicken Dinner However recently I have not had a single death by someone who wasnt across the map shooting through walls hills trees and cars to headshot me 4 times in a row with a fully automatic rifleWith that problem in mind I am hopeful it is swiftly remedied and I can head back in and enjoy my murderous rampage All in all definitely worth the 4000 purchase Especially should they add in an offline mode and get rid of the aimbotcheathacks,positive

It s there yes and I enjoy it however there are 3 facotrs that I brining me to this choice to down vote the game One is there pro streamer ban you policy which hasn t hit me but it s there and you need to know If you kill a streamer you will get bannedTwo are the loot boxes I hate loot boxes had I know there were a greey worthless company that just wanted to take my money and set up a gamlbing lite system I never would have supported the gameAnd third are cheaters just destryoing the game I was doing great 6 almost into the top 5 I was doing everything right well geared hidden in a wheat field And some fool shoots twice at the ground and the aim bot killed me He never saw me in his scope he was just firing blind and letting his aim bot do the rest Cheaters ruin this game It s no fun I feel this game is more trouble then fun So I would suggest you not buy it or support it,negative
Game is good with minor bugs or lag would be great to add a text chat system for squads and duos for those unfortunate enough to not have a mic However intentional teamkillers should be instantly removedbanned from the server instead of them killing you and you have to report them while watching them take your stuff please fix,positive

I couldn t tell anyone to buy this game right now  310The bad  The hackers  every other review addresses these As a fairly high position player under 1000 rank in duo third person I see hackers atleast every 3rd game Its rampant and awful It will be the death of this game if they can t correct it soonThe map  it has random point on it that you will hit while driving that will bring you to a dead stop damage you your passengers and your vehicle These are undetectable and strike at random The desync  at points you will shoot an enemy and see blood sprays but they will not register with the other player Sometimes you will shoot at a distant enemy and your bullet will seemingly vanish Or from your screen you will be softly peeking over a hill but on the other side you will be exposing yourself fully This is especially noticeable early game It s hard to say how bad it is on a normal basis but its there and leaves the game feeling imprecise This is perhaps most noticeable as a passenger in a vehicle You will see it hitting objects and going in all manner of odd directions while the driver is driving perfectly normally down the road Its rather badThe good When you don t encounter cheaters this game is highly rewarding and challenging There is a wide range of ways to play that can all be effective My squad won a game yesterday without firing a single shot in fact we simply out maneuvered all the other squads and had a zero encounter game win Not saying this is my ideal but it shows that no matter what type of player you want to be there is room for the play Guns feel distinct and different Action is fast and intense Ability to aim and fight is equal to the need to use cover and plan your positioning on the fly as the randomized circles don t allow for the same plan every game My conclusion I will change this review to a 910 if they could simply reduce the hackers Its rampant From full blown shoot you through the wall at 800m away all the way down to rampant no recoil scripting Depending on the day anywhere from 30  of my games to 50  of my games have blatant hackers I am sure more than that have the recoil scripting The other issues are nominal and could be addressed,negative
It s rife with hackers cheaters and aim bots They know where you are and won t miss that headshot even with a shotgun from 50 yards away Have video evidence for it also but every  match is packed with them Game was much better before 10 was released but as of right now expect no fair gameplay because for the last week I have not been in 1 single match without aimbots and player location hacks Yikes,negative

Probably the most overrated game of all time Devs wasted 5 minutes to optimize the game the game leaving early acsess is a joke buy r6 instead it may not be the same game but it gives you the same ammount of adrenaline with a better experience and a less cancerous game Takes like 5 minutes to find a match could have more game modes but devs are too lazy so they just released a half made buggy LOVE LOVE LOVE  game so they could get money hire some people to upgrade the game and sit on their asses with money showering,negative
WellActually it is quite a fun game But OMG it has a hacker Problem U cant play any games without getting shot by some dude who killes u with hipfire over 600m It is redicules And that aftert u looted for 15minIt is not worth buying at the moment,negative

I was on the fence about this game for along time Mostly because of the negative reviews saying there is a lot of cheating So far I just think it is a hard game There might be some cheating I honestly can t tell I have had fun though It took a lot of dying over and over before I figured out how to survive longer than a few minutes Now if I take my time I consistently end in the top 20 and many times top 10 I am not qualified to recognize cheating but so far I havn t noticed the difference,positive

this game is super fun but not forgiving you might find one or to nice people but you might not i highly recommend this game if you want a hardcore battle royale game like fortnite this is quite a bit more competitiveyou will run into the hardest of hard core players some times but its usaully quite nicedont play to much like i did for the first while if your one to get a little salty some times this will amplify that so just a warningedit this game is still super buggy still recommend,positive

Im writing this review after 10  full release patch  and gotta say upfront   at the current state the game has many many things that will make you smash your keyboard I ve been thru over 35 hours in this game   won only once  in duos All the good times spent playing this game were mostly the moments when these firefights and shootouts really felt realistic and tactileThe feeling that this game is based on Arma3 is certainly hidden somewhere there but lacks the polish that Arma hasMost of the time you are going to be shot thru corners stones trees or you gonna just get fistpunched down by a guy who landed next to youIt s a laggy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with huge latency jitters and rubberbanding and bugs Really you do need to prepare that most of the time spent in this game will be just pure disappointment   but hey   it s so addictive and realYes exactly this game resembles our own lives   full of misery and shortcomings we live our lives feeling people and world are laggy and jittery we just wait for better times to come Well let me tell you   if you are a sensible bloke   don t buy this game until   it becomes playable or until it diesIf your pants are on fire and you are stupid like other 23 million players every evening  I mean in one moment then yes buy it and be like everyone else   complaining how life is hard in such a great gameSadly there s no option to press both yes and no on recommendation So I m going to press No But I bought it,negative
I honestly dont think this game will ever be bug free If you can accept that it is a fun game,negative
If you enjoy trying to kill cheaters who know where you are can crawl as fast as a vehicle and can 360 hipfire headshot you well this is the game for you,negative
100  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  trash game nothing but hackers and cheaters This game is trash utter trash,negative
Latency issues Hackers Terrible netcode Mic spam Campers Everywhere Unregistered hits Terrible Physics Buggy Gunplay Small weapon pool small vehicle pool terrible optimisation Small item pool small armour pool small pools in pool areas  So basically best shooter on steam ATM because of the lack of QC  quality control on steam nowrecommended,positive
It s Chinas fault this game isnt as good as it could be1010 pre match lobby chat,negative
100,negative
Still needs more polish but overall worth every penny paid for it I ve probably had more fun on this game in the past year than several AAA title games combined,positive
Beware every game is now filled with hackers,negative
Need a region lock due to the many hackers on PUBG it is honestly dissapointing coming top 2 and the last squad is all hackers who have super jump and auto aim This game is fun but Anti Cheat needs a rework because anyone who played arma 2 knows battle eye is trash anti cheat,negative
I d love to give game the thumbs up and a great positive review for it because it does deserve i feel TL DR at the bottomThe devs are working to improve how smooth the game runs load times and etc and me playing on a low end PC it definitely shows Pre 10 i still had a fair bit of issues with the game but they ve fixed so much So credit where credit is dueI love the gameplay for me it s a kind of unique experience When you re playing squad mode with your friends and you run into an enemy squad in the next compound over and a high intesity firefight begins it s an awesome rush and it leaves you wanting another engagement like itAll that being said the major issues become clear after you ve sunk your first 30 hours in Not having a region lock almost encourages players to use a server that s not closest to them for the best ping for example Me being an Australian player could go onto the NA server and abuse my ping An American player could be behind cover for that split second that could save him but he is still in view for me The amount of hackers in this game is just horrid and Yes they are mostly chinese Ive watched duo match replays where they were just scoping in on my building from across the other side of a town Or when you re about 500m out from a town and someone goes full auto on an SKS and hits every single shot in the head from that distanceThose are my major two negatives currently and it does affect my experience This is a good game and I d reccomend definitely buying it but only when they fix the amount of hackers and place a region lock inTL DR    Great game but give it a miss till they get rid of most of the hackers,negative
there are too many hackers to play most of the are chineese hackers trying to enjoy a good game with my friend but sadly with this game is not possible,negative
Gosh this game NEEDS region restriction  This is not about race or anything to do with that but its ZERO fun to play with chinese people who doesnt speak any other language And that is like 90  of the timeEdit  In addition to that WTF BLUEHOLE     Why CANT YOU DO ANYTHING to STOP the CHEATERS   ,negative
First off let me say that I ve played this game for quite a while now I played it early into the open beta and had many opportunities to give this game a fair shot But Now I have to at least tell other people just how much this game actually blowsLets do the whole ProsCons thing  Side note I m going to be as honest as I canPros  Great graphics  Whoo hoo The gun modding is kind of neat Adds depth to an otherwise bland genre When in a team with friends it can be fun The feel of some of the sniper rifles and assault rifles are pretty great Recoil handling and bullet drop are pretty spot onCons  Unbalanced weapons  ie Shotgun damage headshot damage  pistols in particular Unrealistic in a marketed realistic game  Punching someone doesnt stagger someone no bleeding when shot The sound in the game is horendous Sure they updated what things sound like but when someone is full on sprinting beside me and I dont hear that person which in turn gets me killed cause he could hear me running  Seems a little stupid if you ask me Deathcam makes it look like the person is either somehow hitting me while shooting into the skyground which in turn makes me want to report said person for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cheating or its just simply a broken mechanic that shouldn t have been added into the game until it was fully tested and perfected So many bugs 10 shouldn t be 10 It still feels like beta to me This game is not optimised at all They said during early beta when I first got the game that it would be fixed by release and yet they still havent fully fixed the issue Desyncing horribly all over the place trying to grab a gun and the game won t let me grab it but the guy who gets to it after me immediately picks it up and kills me with said gun Lets be real about the new map too Its not a fun map at all Sure there are some great places on the map for looting and for the beginning of the game but when it comes to traversing it and trying to be safe and stealthy and tactical it just doesnt work at all Its so obvious to other players where you are while you try to run to the next circle that players spot me from 3 miles awaySo to sum it all up its a broken half promised mess that really needs to be fixed,negative
x4 scope,positive
1010 when you win,positive
Please be advised that as of yet this game still feels like a beta and hackers are rampant I ll update this if the problems are addressed,negative
this game is fun and its always fun not knowing how the next game will play out but there is still a lot that needs to be done about this game vaulting is still kinda whack my main problem with this game is the chinese in the NA server region block needs to be added if youre trying to play solo on squads good luck trying to get people who speak english its really fustrating trying to play a team based game type and not able to understand your teammates i dont reccomend this game at the moment but maybe in time the devs will fix the issues,negative
I d rather play mc survival games,positive
DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEThis game was released to version  10  not because it was a completed game ready for a  10  release but rather just in time for Christmas to increase their sales and soak up every last piece of currency they possibly could They wont even region lock this game and because of that this game is running rampant with hackers and at this point its unacceptable and borderline unplayable Money hungry developers who don t listen to their player base Hackers Glitches that have been in this game since easrly access RELEASE Bugs in the test server that they couldn t even bother fixing before pushing it to  10  live servers SadThis game and its developers are trash Again do not buy this game,negative
too many chinese hackers with aimbot and wallhacks on regionlockchina,negative
Da Jihad is strong in this game,positive
This game sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE  because of the Chinese hackers PUBG doesn t even hand out VAC bans and reporting players does nothing If they fixed the hacking issue then it would be a great game,negative
When I first purchased this game it was a lot of fun then cheaters more cheaters and even more cheaters started playing This situation has made the game no longer fun I have turned into a loot collector for the cheaters Do not waste your money on this game until they have fixed the cheating issues,negative
I would wait before buying this game it is still very buggy,negative
It s fine sometimes the monotony become you bored but ok,positive
Completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that the game Auto selects AS region server for my game when i launch at times then i click and change it to NA and i still have games with 70  Asian Region people from playout outside of the NA region no one speaks english online it seems for me 2 out of 10 games i get someone who speaks english in Squad,negative
Don t buy this dumpster fire unless you like the smell of burning human refuse Chinese hackers who have no other outlet to derive pleasure other than to inflict discontent on people who just want a chicken dinner are ruining this game Suck it Brennan Greene I hope that dude from college finds you and punts you in the chest like a super bowl winning field goal,negative
Don t buy this game,negative
Game is infested with chinese cheatershackers dont buy this game or u will be frustrated,negative
The game is extremely fun and challenging however specific regions need to stay in their own servers  Though I ve only encountered chinese hackers a couple of times they still need to stay in their own servers  Once that issue is fixed it will be a fantastic game,positive
The game was so fun until you start seeing hackers around  Bluehole  please  save us ,positive
This game is really cool and i support this game It is very fun and you should download it But if u dont have a good monitor or graphics card your fps would be very low unless u turn the graphics down Overall it is a fun game and you should download it,positive

I suck but I still love playing,positive
What a complete joke of a gameMaps so empty they make Ubisoft open world games look more complete in comparison more walking than a walking simulator and the game boils down to  get a sniper or you don t win  This doesn t even go into the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tain that is the community Barely fun even with friends because you re not seeing any action for a solid goddamn 15 minutes before you re killed right at the end because  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you you don t have a long range weapon git gud  This doesn t even go into the streamsniping controversy or PLAYERUNKNOWN s insanity that this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is somehow originalEating the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  covered LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of a dog will be more fun,negative

My second favourite game ever,positive
If you play now you WILL meet a Chinese hacker at least once per game Until a region lock gets put into place every game you will lose to a headshot or lock on bot It s not worth it until they LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off to play this game,negative
The game is freaking amazing it has a considerably hard gameplay Hard to get really good at it s fun as hell to play with friends but the only thing that makes this review negative is  After so many bugs and problems the game just makes you sad for dying because it either didn t render or because it s lagging for you at the start of the match but of course your enemies don t have this match start lag they all run to weapons and get them while you re stuck on the freaking ground I ll continue to play PUBG cause i love it and I spent 800 hours on it but if you are a person with low patience well PUBG is not the game for you Oh I almost forgot there s also the Chinese hackers going to your servers to stomp you,negative
This game Is not ready for Key Micro Transactions at all I d perfer not to spend money on a game that you literally can t even get past the loading screen into This needs to be fixed The loading GUI bug needs to be fixed badly Been happening for atleast a Month now and has gotten worse Really pisses me off when I want to go play but get stuck loading in,negative
The game is runnig nice the gameplay is awesome and i love itYou need to try this game,positive
Had a lot of fun playing this game but then got banned for suspected 3rd party software  Which I have no affiliation with Only buy if you don t mind getting banned for no reason,negative
This game is good when you can get a decent LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game which is 510 games otherwise get ready for ruberbanding city or the mysterious crashes you get every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing time and thats what LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing kills you and makes youi lose the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game,negative
The game is good but please optimized more for 1050Ti users,positive
Fun to solo and a great ton of fun to play in a squad of friends  Game can be extremely frustrating and some games are running to keep into the circle with a pisol crowbar or single granade only to be ran over or shot from afar  The first 5 10 games are nearly impossible to play as there is not much to do to get use to the games other than being thrown into firefights which are often lost due to mechanics being kind of unknown  For 30 it is not a bad game,positive
RECOMMENDED,positive
Ok for starters its not a bad game  its ok few problems here and there yeah sure  but all games have problems but what really pisses me of about this game are the fn chines hackers ohhhh my god  JUST BAN THE COUNTRY seriously Bluehole just make them be able to play against themselves Long term i can see this improoving but what will kill this GAME OF  IS THE HACKERSWould i recomend this as a game yeah sure 30 is the perfect price from being abl to afford it to not being to Is it fun HELL yes  no ifs or buts about it,positive
keren banget,positive
The original battle royale game I cant see this forty night rip off game being better,positive
Game not launching for me sorry bad review  please help me find a solution,negative
so many cheaters you just  cant play a real game after 1700 hours this game has so many cheaters you wont know if your bad or just getting killed by cheaters that have no recoil or wall hack or aim bot i have no idea why they dont ban pepole its not hard pepole report them just dont give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
Awesome fun but know that it s a beast to run and your computer will put in a lot of work to run it If you re like most people and don t have dual Titan X GPU s then turn down the graphical settings from medium to very low,positive
I know de way,positive
Just utterly bad,negative
Dear BlueholePlease FIX YOUR DAMN GAME I am not worry about the bugs or sever crashing it says alot when you play on all low settings and get 25 bellow fps and when i put the settings on all ultra the game magicly went from 25 fps to 80 fps like wtf this do not make sense at all i have 0 problesm when i started playing this game back in august 2017 and when i played the test server for the new map my fps was through the roof getting 150 playing on all low like what happen to you guys optimising the game  you have unreal engine one of the best engine there is in the world please fix i have not touch this game for over a week now and i used to play it everyday and looking foward to it after work to relax but now i just play other games,negative
Fun to watch fun to play and FUN TO WINWINNER WINNER C DINNER HAHAHAH,positive
Garbage not worth it seeing my friends on steam online but offline on Pubg  Lobby lot of random infinite loading screen,negative
Overhyped garbage literally one of the biggest mistakes I ever done in my life is giving the developers of this game my money How is this game out of  Early Access  if it s still the same buggy mess   The optimization is f  king horrible  Matchmaking is more laggy than it was in  Early Access   Lootboxes  A lot of servers are filled with hackers  most of them are Chinese  The creator of PUBG is a cry baby who wanted to sue  Epic Games  for including  Battle Royale  mode in their game    Fortnite   a game that is 10x better than this crap Can t wait him to try and sue  Hi Rez Studios  since they also going to add  Battle Royale  mode to their game    Paladins Save your money buy some indie games like  A Hat in Time   Cuphead   Shantae  and support them or buy some AAA games like  Tekken 7   PayDay 2   Assasin s Creed  Origins  or better yet just buy  Fortnite    a game that is 10x more fun the matchmaking is great and it doesn t have much hackers I m never going to support  PUBG Corporation  ever again,negative
regionlock china,negative
still wondering why they added a holster button,negative
I have put over 400 hours in this game Was it worth it definitely notThe servers  eu were fine for me until the update 10 came outSuddenly I am being killed when behind cover and more of that bullsh tIt is a really fun game to play if the servers are working fine and you are not matched with only pro s Ooh and the I still can t hear any footsteps310 Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game,negative
LOCK REGION CHINA,negative
This was once a great game but   1 The North American server is overrun with Chinese players which creates a number of problems other than the obvious language barrier trying to coordinate during a gun battle2 While I will admit that the majority of the Chinese players are friendly I also have noticed a drastic uptick in teamkilling I have been team killed by my Chinese team members more times in one weekend than than I ever was in the first 6 months of the games release3 Cheaters cheaters and more cheaters no explanation needed   see numer one above 4 The game has some serious lag issues and the worst part of the lag seems to be at the very begining when players are landing and everyone is scrambling for a weapongun which is the ABSOLUTE the worst time you want to experience lag5 The latest release has introduced a number of bugs which by themselves are not deal breakers they do add to the overall fustration level when combined with previous pointsThe game can be entertaining with some of the funny things that occur in the game from time to time but overall I have to give the game a thumbs down until at the very minimum the cheating is under control Some people claim that there are not alot of cheatersbut considering that matches have 100 playersit only takes 1 cheater to ruin the fun for 99 other players,negative
So this game it use to be really fun and enjoyable then 10 released the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lag and fps hits is stupid I use to run 100 FPS and now i barely hit 60 the lag is so stupid to the point where you cant even hit bloody shots,negative
Its all fun in games until your game goes to roblox mode you turn into a timeshifting space marine walk through walls and get headshoted from a guy who can see your every move like a detective and has the aim of the guy who killed Kennedy Just saying,positive
Very very nice game Gucci gameplay would recommend to any LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  who still likes fortnite,positive
Game it self would be great if it was not full of chinese on OC servers random rubber banding lag and hackers You will find all of these every single game Far to exspensive for what it is play fortnite instead,negative
This is an extremely overrated game Outdated graphics and stubborn control The play style is not groundbreaking at all  though it has been an improvement compared to H1Z1 Bugs glitches and hackers are all over the place and the official PC lauch barely introduces any real improvements compared to previous beta versions The new map seems better polished but much more frustrated to play than the old one I played this game solely because my friends played too and I still don t get why they would think this game was so much fun That being said if you got no friends to play alongside you there s really no need buying it,negative
Going from fortnite on ps4 to Pubg on here this game is way better and way more realistic i love the game,positive
Great with friends average solo Eat my LOVE LOVE LOVE ,positive
PLEASE REGION LOCKI AM TIRED OF THE CHINESE HACKERS,negative
Great game fun for friends to go and play around and pretend you re special forces against hackers Because 90  of every game you play you ll be headshot by a hacker who doesn t even aim down his sight to kill you or even look in your direction when he shoots1010 would go to war against China because they don t have aimbots in real life,negative
For LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s sake get rid of the chinese players on American servers Im  sick of being sniped from 29431 miles away by some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  name Xing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Pao,positive

Played about  6  Games tonight  half of which ended with a 500 meter hip fire spray and pray from across the map Really good cheat detection going on and everygame you are watching the kill feed for 39429347guanzau0949184 to show up with 34 headshots instantly in a row so you know to quit and not waste more time driving around Was a good game before it got popular as f but with release and the obvious hacking problem it is just not rewarding to play,negative
Look this game is great and super fun but this game has way to many hackers Every game I have been in since the relase has had a hacker I would leave a good review but it just hurts me playing looting sim for a referance about 810 games me and my squad have played 8 of them have hackers,negative
sorry unplayable terible frame rate why does every room load seperately depending on if you are in them or not  12fps im dead before i can even see whats happening im refunding,negative
Great game but as of recently hackers have been ruining the matchmaking Constant aimbot shots and chinese infiltrating the NA servers RegionLockChina,negative

its a fun game to play but i cant play it on my laptop i can only hear the sonds of it and i wait 4 hours for it to do some thing and it takes me out of the game look i support your game and community but i am stuck on the loading screen plz fix this i got this for christmas it was fun but i didnt like this christmas just because of that so plz fix this,positive
The netcode needs improvement ASAP BF4 is instant compared to this The death cam only confirms my suspicion Full 4 5 hits from an AKM not registering is one example Getting  corner killed  almost a full second after crossing the corner etc etc Triggering to no endBesides that I have a lot of fun with friends negative review for now though,negative
Awesome game to play w friends and kill pplz,positive
Is this game overpriced  Yes it is it lacks of content like different gamemodes maps guns etc It also has an unpolished indie game like feelingDid I still buy it   Yes I did because the game is all the same fun and addictiveBy the way it has to be said that this game has the best gunplay sounds I have ever heard in any game That greatly increases the immersion,positive
It wont launch for me i bought it twice and it wont launch,negative
1010 pure adrenaline pumping fun,positive
The game was fun at first then I started to notice all the hacking that was being done Hopefully there will be patches for this game and then il play more of it until then the chinese are still in existence This game is a yesno for me  Just expect to be killed all the time by hackers even though you have the drop on them,negative
A LOT OF CHEATER S ASIA AND SEA pls take some actions to this issue,positive
Don t waste your money on this game right now It s riddled with hackers and they don t only come from China They rushed the game to get their 10 release out before the end of the year so they could make it to some kind of Game of the Year BS which really shows Their servers are complete garbage They lag badly Even after their  server update fix  Nothing like shooting at a player running out in the open only to lose sight of them because the server sent them 50 feet back the direction they were running from Or my favorite   shooting at someone in a window who is peeking at you but instead of you hitting them they hit you even though they are no longer peeking at you and haven t been for over a full second  kill cam confirmed on a couple of these This game is poorly optimized for sure If you have a baller LOVE LOVE LOVE  computer then you will alright to play But if you are lacking in certain hardware you are screwed Games shouldn t be this way but they areThe gun mechanics only make half sense and are something to be desired and on top of that are completely inconsistent For some reason when prone you can only look up so high which does make sense But when you are prone with your head facing uphill you can t look any higher off the hill than where you are laying It s like they have the prone vertical viewing angle set at a certain degree that can t be passed no matter what I would say wait to buy this game Let the devs work out all the kinks and bring it up to the 10  release  it SHOULD be atThis game has potential but needs A LOT of workAs of right now not recommending this game to anyone at the moment,negative
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hate this game but I do like chicken dinners,negative
The rebalanced of weapon was the most stupid upgrade Play like a new game and restart to learn how to shoot So I leave,negative

PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds may have been buggy at one point However at this point most bugs have been ironed out The game is polished and almost completely devoid of bugs Definitely buy PUBG if you want to play a game that requires more skill and tactics than other popular battle royale games such as  cough  Fortnite,positive
like the game greatly however there something needs to be done about the chinese taking over servers region lock  ,positive
I mean if you get a free chicken dinner in your second ever solo round oke xDthe players arent even trying at the end the second last guy sat on my face when i was on the ground and the last guy didnt even see me and i got a chicken dinner without getting hit with a bullet the whole game just call me a legend boyz and grills  ,positive
Not as buggy as it is made to be framerate does suck Fun stuff overall,positive
If I was asked to write a review for this game when it first came out I would have given this game a positive review It was fun and you could get hours of gameplay out of it with your friends and it felt great when you finally won a game However this game gets a negative review now because it has turned into a  hackers paradise  Every single game I have played in the past week has had at least 1 2 hackers They were either in duos or solo It has made playing the game a miserable existence I have consistently lost games due to Chinese hackers who it seems get away with it The PUBG corporation needs to pick up its game on dealing with this MASSIVE amount of hackers playing the game most of which who are Chinese They could start by locking the servers down so that these hackers get locked into the Asian servers and  not be able to join NA or any other servers This could be a temporary fix until the come to a successful solution to soving the issue Until they get the hackers under control this game is just unfun to play So until they come up with a solution this game deserves a negative review But in the mean time here s one REGION LOCK THE CHINESE SERVERS,negative
very addictive and good game however the developers need to get there act together with this game they are charging people 2 to open crates and they ban people who have never cheated while they let the real cheater off as they are so incompetantive never cheated at any game in my entire life i dont even know were to get cheats from and i get suspended every week for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all its just that the developers know what to do and that is region lock china they just dont want to do it as they are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s who dont want to be called racist,negative
The game can be fun to play when you can play a entire match without the game kicking you  Happens way to often,positive
PLEASE region LOCK  Would be a fantastic experience without the hackers  But what s to be expected when the devs are raking in the dough with every copy sold Great business model  Ban the hackers do nothing else allow said hacker to buy another account  typically with stolen CC  stay at the top of Steam Best SellersPlease fix your game before big brother gets his dirty hands involved  I fear that one day soon a dev will be made example of,negative

Game was great until the Chinese got a hand on itCan now rarely group with english speaking people and the lag has become a real isssuePass until they fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  if they do,negative
So I m not quite sure where to start with this reviewDont buy the game,negative
Look I enjoy the game I like battle royal games Obviously with most games there has to be something that just sucks THE AMOUNT OF CHINESE PLAYERS ON OCE Srsly im not racist or anything but it gets very annoying when a bunch of chinese players are screaming in to the mic telling me to go F    my mother All these players from other regions also lag ALOT which is annoying because its just a lagfest and you cant win because you just have these players jumping from place to place If all of that is fixed up then this game will be in a great spot,positive

This game does the battleroyal genre the best out of them all Sure there are issues but the game did just come out of early access its only been a full game for what a month or two the game is worth playing and definately even more so with friends It obiously takes time to get used to how people play the game and choosing your areas server is definately helpful if i had to say personally ill rate it a 710 only for certain issues like lag and hackers but its a problem every game has Also to be fair these issues arent helped by the ammount of players that play Most played steam game currently,positive

The most overrated game I have played in years Also PlayerUnknown is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    ,negative
Best game Ive played in years for originality I know battlerounds isnt the first game to use the battle royale formula but it seems I chose the best executor of the concept When I first bought battlegrounds I had no expectations I had around 1600 hours in CS GO and wanted to play an open world survival game I read that battlegrounds was more of a shooter than a survival game which at the time wasnt what I wanted I watched a few videos and read a few reviews detailing the mechanics of the game and thought eh this sounds fun and novel enough to spend 30 on600 hours later and Im finally playing my other games  I stopped playing Witcher 3 Divinity  Original Sin 2 Prey CSGO I will probably never play CSGO again as Valve doesnt take care of their hacker problem and I played CSGO since the original games beta which I installed from a PC Gamer disc sometime around 2000 With Bluehole enforcing a 15 million player ban for cheating since PC 10 Im hopeful that they will manage their community better than valve ever did For the most part I find the community in PUBG to be okay As a comparison CSGO was filled with racism sexism xenophobia and bigotry It wasnt uncommon for people with white supremacist names to be spewing bigotry Ive had to team up with a fair number of bigoted players in PUBG but they are easier to deal with because if I dont want to play a match with someone I can back out without a penalty Also a nazi thrives on stupid people supporting their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t inflammatory statements so when they dont have someone backing everything they say and actually have to use reason to argue their argument falls apart Or you can just make fun of them for being a nazi  the choice is yours As far as trolling goes Ive encountered that only in random squads Every so often you end up hitting a squad that has two really intentionally annoying players or someone who wants to drive everyone into another squad to be killed Duos people are pretty cooperative because its a little awkward to be an aggro LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  when its just you and your teammate and nobody else to witness the LOLs Ive met a few solid steam friends through duosAs far as looting goes  the game is pretty shallow here There is no crafting Its a matter of figuring out which guns work for you finding them and finding your preferred mods Ive won games with very little loot and Ive lost games level 3d out with suppressors on my AR and sniper rifles But looting isnt what the game is about really  its about teamwork and working with the terrain to gain an advantage over your enemies Enemies on the hill behing a house getting shot at by guys you dont see inside of the house  Run up during the firefight and clear the house or wait in ambush for the team to loot the bodies One thing you learn quick is to not engage everyone you see Youre here to survive not get kills Let your enemies do the work of killing for you as you have no stake in which team lives and dies in a skirmish And wounded players are a few bullets less you have to wasteWhile you may develop favorite places to drop and find yourself in a regular loot cycle where the circles force you to move is what keeps the game dynamic You may start at the same place in two back to back games but be forced to move in opposite directions for each When the circle gets small tactical decisions like should we take the house at the center of the circle or the hill at the edge  Become a matter of critical importance Goddamn it we shouldve gone dead center to the house while we had the chance is a pretty commonly used phrase that I cap a failed game withGun mechanics  there are more realistic weapon ballistics than instaclick games like CSGO  sorry to make the comparison its just the shooter I have the most experienc with Understanding bullet velocitydrop and weapon mobility are all important What you click isnt always what you get This makes the game more challenging in my opinion and I like it Im annoyed that maximum foliage isnt a mandatory thing as the game would be so much more interesting if you could hide in the grass Most players turn it to its mimimum value so hiding in the grass is useless until the final circlesVaulting can be clunky Ive vaulted off a 3 story building when I was just trying to jump onto a ledge and landed right down between two enemies I was trying to get the drop on  but not like that a few times and needless to say thats incredibly frustrating Anyway go buy the game If you havent tried it by the end of 2018 what kind of gamer are you even sweetie ,positive

WE NEED REGION LOCK PLEASE this game was so good the hackers are unreal now we hear you saying your banning people but its not helping you say that 90  of the hackers are chinese players just make them play and hack eachother they come to our servers on 300 ping and we cant do nothing in a game where its last man standing it takes the fun out of the game and the wind outta your sale to hit that play button again and its depressing that you guys could give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  cause one hacker banned is just another copied sold when he makes a new steam account to buy the game again to continue the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  circle figure it out,negative
PLz buy it nice game,positive
Good game absolutely ruined by rampant hackers,negative
Wonderful Game also severley ruined by devs like DrDisrespect said it is held by   tape thing string and rocks   that to a degree don t hold together they are putting in new stuff which is buggy and still not resolving issues that still occur since pre release of 10 which was also bad I could go on forever if you played the game long anough you would understand Also it is essentially following the same bussines model as Fortnite unfortunately it also comes with a price tag just like everything else in the game as the crates do not give you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    Play and enjoy you definitely will enjoy it but it will dissapoint you as time goes on,negative

While this game is very fiun and has vehicles to run people over with this game is poorly optimized unless you have a GTX 1050 TI or better I think Fortnite is a much more reasonable option  because it is free and it is optimized for a potato PC like mine Save your 30 for something better that you ACTUALLY want,negative

Great game but hackers really putting me off   don t understand why there isn t region lock and why there isn t more attempts to ban cheatersStarting to wonder if repeat purchases from hackers is getting seen as a revenue stream by PUBG team because it surely can t be hard to detect the blatant looking at you through walls or insta gib M16 aimbot no recoil kills,negative
Short and sweet  It s the 3rd world version of games in its genre I suppose it markets well to those who can t handle games with any depth at all but for anyone wanting intricacy in their shooter games you will NOT find it here,negative
Even tho the game is pretty new I haven t yet seen any cons of this game except for the shotguns being so OP,positive
I hate this game but also at the same time love itSolo is quite boring but if you have at least one friend in your life who plays pubg then go for itIt is so much fun playing duo or squadYou can screw around do silly things or you can get super serious and tacticalIt used to be buggy as hell when it first came out as early access but most of them are fixed and the game runs really well most of the timesAnd for 30  This game is worth every dollar,positive
Horrifically bad How did this get so popular ,negative
810 way better then h1z1,positive
Good gem i guess,positive
I honestly really enjoy this game However I can only enjoy DUO or SQUAD play when I have friends playing with me 90  of the time I am paired with asian players They cannot understand me and I cannot understand them Making playing as a team impossible Plus I have notice a lot of cheaters really hoping that gets taken care of For instance me and my cousin were playing duo on the desert map We were nearing the end of the match with 3 teams including our selves  give or take My cousin threw smoke grenades that covered us We both died from a head shot We watched the death cam He preformed both head shots while jumping with a scar through smoke that we couldnt even see ourselves in Clearly cheating on that one Ive had many questionable games It gets frustrating but I have gotten to the point to just ignoring trying to win I just go in for kills A lot of BS happens towards the ending Hopefully they start doing something better for the cheating and to help keep NA servers a little more on the english side HARD to enjoy playing with others when you cant understand you and because of that language barrier they kill you and loot your stuff,positive
Great when it loads,positive
It feels like it should be a good game There are lots of matches and the matchmaking is quicker than CS GO  for Australians I just feel that more should have been done with the concept of the game Running around a dessert and picking up weaponryarmoretc to gain the advantage over whoever you find It s fun in a sense Obviously people have found a way to have fun with it I just think it s so cheap feeling that it s a bit of waste of money,negative

Its a pretty good game if brain necrosis and insanity is what you re aiming for most unfunny unpolished unfinished which is kinda the same unoptimized game i ve seen so far overhyped by streamers you ll need a 10k PC to run this fluently and u ll still get frame drops and optimization issues i never regretted the time spent on something this much please don t buy it u ll thank me later on when you guys die of elderly,negative

Lag is a real problem  Constantly hit by people shooting where I was a second ago,negative
Postponed putting this review up in hopes there would be a patch or something that would resolve the issue There hasn t been Don t know why I expected one Honestly I really enjoyed this game to start original map with decent servers with minimal lag was absolutely on point Then you chucked up the new map with new server layouts and the unbelievable influx of chinese hackers who quickly destroyed Oceania as a server There is a not a single game where myself and friends don t have to square down one man using aim bot speed hacks or early drop cheats to their own advantage Fix your game If its simply region locking or creating a more desisive way of eliminating hackers do it Right now your game is unplayable and its a joke,negative
great game easy to get into however for me it gets so intense and your always on alert which basically gives me PTSD,positive
Start with nothing Get some items Shoot some peeps Outrun the blue circle Slightly janky reminiscent of Operation Flashpoint in a fun way The maps are very big and if you parachute into an area with limited buildings you can avoid other players for most of the game Or you can dive into the city areas for some mayhem,positive

I got this game when i had a potato for gaming didn t run at all 3 fps lowest settings Now with an actual computer game runs super smooth  imho  i don t need 120913 fps to enjoy a game and is fun and challenging I rarely rank top 10 hardly get more than 1 kill a game and when I play through matchmaking I rarely ever have any connectivity problems I can t speak about these hackers I haven t really encountered any that I could tell but I ve only 138 hours as of this post It s hard it s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t but sometimes its really great Biggest issue is the crate system i ve only gotten 2 but they had the same item and the BP price hike makes it feel useless,positive

I m not sure why this game has such mixed reviews take it from me it s a fantastic game and everybody should have it in their library If you re on the fence about buying this game because of the mixed reviews buy it you ll love it like any sane person would People that are saying this game is full of hackers I ve never run in to a single hacker from my 87 hours of playing Also people saying this game is the worst for it connection fix your wifi shut your mouth it s your internet not the game,positive
So far so good its a solid game to play if your bored unless you have no friends to play with,positive

This game is lovehate relationship really If the game is going well for you and you re striving for greatness then hell yeah On the other hand if the game is crashing and not going well then damn itThis game is honestly great fun I love the randomness of it and how different each game will be and that is one of the main reasons I keep coming back to it you never know how that match is going play out You could win or be the first to die who knows There is a lot of skill involved but it didn t take me too long to really get the hang of the concept and which weapons to use or to not use etc Just takes a little bit of expierence and timeI was really surprised by how crisp the game feels I mean It s not perfect but pretty dang good if you ask me All the guns feel great and different etcThe sounds are incredible thrilling and very scary at times Play the game on high volume if possible it s definetly the best way to play itSo the only thing I really dislike about this game is the crashes  they happen quite often compared to other shooters I ve played It s going to be different for everyone but for me it crashes about 1 or 2 times every 2 games or so One thing that s nice though is that if you launch the game back quickly enough it will let you jump back in that match assuming you haven t died yetOverall a very fun game that I recommend Expect a very good time and a bit of frustration here and there,positive
This is a good game you should get it,positive
Overall great game Definitely would buy again and recommend to a friend 910 because of some bugs   ,positive

Back before full release I always heard about the game having a lot of cheaters but didn t experience it often at all Maybe 4 cheaters in about 300 hours But after full release it is almost every game I encounter a cheater and I just have to get into another one and hope that there isn t a cheater It just really sucks becuase the game is a great game but I wouldn t play it until they fix that problem,negative
Quite a fun game after it came out of early access the fps dramatically increased and I love you for that but this has to be said  It is claimed that there has been 15 million hackers banned from the game yet I still encounter quite a lot of blatant hackers in most of my games that being around 13 games I play And that is not an overexaggeration This game is really fun and I really enjoy it the mechanics are good the way the maps are designed are great for gunfights The ONLY thing that lets it down for me are hackers Another thing I have noted is that there are a lot of chinese people playing in EU servers and this is annoying as they have a higher ping so they are harder to hit as they lag around quite a lot please fix this and make it so you have to be under a certain ping to play in a certain region,positive
This game is very good unless you play with the chinese In which case you just make fun of them and then they say some china stuff Then you tell them to play on there own servers and then its fun but all in all this game is very fun They need to add region lock asap but thats the only problem,positive

I couldn t get enough of this game through pre release  consistent updates always improving the game with optimisationSpending endless hours on the game then suddenly the increase of hackers occur Understandibly hackers are a given within a game but the pure number of hackers is insane Every game im getting sprayed down by a UMP from about 600m away especially with the death cam rubbing it in our faces now it really has killed my love for this gameJust hope they seriously sort this hacker issue out or i see this game falling real quick,negative

This game is great  I love it  Then the Chinese hordes came to the North American servers  You can t speak with them or hit them due to them having pings guessing in the 800 1400 range  Blantant wallaimbot hacks rampant among players with names such as p1300534  If they ever PING LOCK  300 buy it  Why you would allow people to play halfway accross the world in a FPS game is beyond me  Over 1500000 banned for hacks and its a drop in the bucketThumbs down till ping lock,negative
my game is instell and i cant open i pay for this it has been more than weak plese fix it soon,positive
It really is a dissapointment at the state of the game This used to be   and still is  probably one of my favorite games and has been a total blast to play with friends Unfortunately it seems impossible to have fun knowing youve probably got a hacker in your game and all of your trying is absolutely useless And just knowing the fact that hackers are gonna win every game takes the whole fun out of  having a good time even if you dont come out on top  it seems rare to make it past the top 5 now If i could take a look at my WL over time im sure itd show a massive drop right around when the game dropped in 10 The sad thing is just that hackers arent a once in maybe 10 games occurence id say every game you get into has a 710 chance of having autoaiming hackers in the server Its not even hiddne at all most of the time its some person with a Kar98 or Automatic AR sniping from an impossible distance with no recoil in third person recticle mode Nothing is more frustrating than having an M249 in the final 10 with 8 kills just to get shot in the head and have a frag land right next to you and instanly explode then watching the kill cam to see  LiuXiabo123  sitting outside of the blue zone with no damage and autoaim I would love to be able to actually play the game more but it seems pointless as even if im in the final few theres probably an asian hacker ready to screw me with an instant headshot Please do something to fix this I would NOT buy this game for a couple more months until the hackers are gone At this point it is simply unplayable,negative

I ve played my fair share of matches both  with  without friends as well as in first and third person and if im being honest havent won once  techinically I did but I died in the first encounter and watched my team win wo me and thats a hollow victory if nothing else There are games that I  pop off  in but those are only happen 120 games and are usually followed by a swift death outside the zone or to the hands of professional sniper leaving the majority of my expeience in PUBG both hollow and full of failure after failure after failure with no full sembalence of growth after each failed attempt no matter what aspect I change Ive noticed that the  gunplay  is nothing more than a bucket of ship with a  realism  label on the side Im all for realism but there is a fine line between realistic ARMA and idealised CoD that will make a gaming experience both fun to play and realistic to a degree  Wildlands  Pubg however leans slightly to far to the realistic side by design which makes the prosess of  lining up a shot and pulling the trigger  incredibly infuriating in shortmed ranges and borderline impossible at long range for me On the other side of the barrel while being shot at 95  of times you cant even tell where the shooter is as there are no tracers to indicate positioning and even when you are hit there is no indication of the direction you were just hit from to even give you a chance at turning on them before your inevitable demise so alot of the hardcore community are probably are going to say that  im just bad  or  why dont you get better  well id love too but I cant get better at the game if im having my head taken off while hiding behind a rock from a direction i cant even begin to aprehend PUBG is incredibly hard takes alot of skill detication and luck most likely to the point where the so called  cheaters  or  Hackers  from america are probably whats left of the casual comunity and boy howdy do i want to join em Im sure the game will evolve and get better iron out some bugs im sure but Im not stickn round to see it the devs dont care they ve got my 30 but at least I ll be having fun everywhere else but here,negative
Even after one year on the market GoTY award and official release  this game is still buggy and choppy as ever I can t even reminisce on how many times I died to something out of my control just because the game glitches out Not to even MENTION  the amount  of chinese hackers on the NA server  the uncontrollable challenges this gamme creates make this game unberable on a daily basis,negative
Do not buy this game Cheaters have seized control of the servers all hope is lost,negative
It is mpossible to find an English speaking team mates in random Duo or Squads mode on Oceania servers but going by the comments it seams everywhere else tooThis is ruinig this game for me yes some of my steam friends play this game but we are not always online at the same timePlease find a solution for this so I can enjoy my bloody game,negative
can i buy this game with vac  ,positive
The Game is GreatChinese Players Are PRo not Hackersso haters to keep blaming the chinesethere is a little lag well but its smooth for the version 10cant wait for more updatesKeep Up tHe HARD WORKS DevsMy PC plays it all at Ultra without Hesitate tnx to GTX 1070 Ti   Purchase you Wont Regret   Ignore the negetive reviews,positive
full of hackers and logic is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
I have about 50 wins under my belt so ive been playing for a bit However i feel the game is really fun if you prefur solo   i dont or with clans the game is really fun Playing with people really make a game even more fun than normal so if you get a duo partner or a full team you really cant hate the game,positive
Cheaters win Winners cheat A great game broken by cheater and hackers,negative
For the love of god so many Hackers after the 10 release please find a way to ban these people from even playing the game Its ungodly annoying to jump on a game and enjoy it til someone aimhacks your head from 1000 yards away not looking down the scopeI love the game hands down but recently too many hackers are on and another thing I miss window jumping vaulting is great but the option to do both is better,positive
Let me make this really simple Hackers Every Single Game You will fight your hardest and reach to the top ten or twenty then suddenly have 7 rifle shots on full auto blast you right in your head instantly killing you before you can even react This game was set for success but it WILL fail if DRASTIC measures are not taken against the hacking community It s so blatant and so prevalent it is a shame that a game of this unprecendented success cannot keep up Save your money until this game breaking issue has been resolved,negative
I love this game I could not ask for any better they have finally optimized this game so well I can play on my laptop and there is less and less hackers rarely when I get in a game once in a while there will be a hacker but not as much anymore The game is hard but I m getting used to it and getting better as I play and progress to the next hame Highly recommend this hame for any one who loves battle Royale it s worth the money,positive
Love the game Hate the Developer Have been able to play the game for 255 hours but since the last patch dropped i cannot load the game Everytime I load the game it will now crash and I cannot play The developers apparently dont care about optimizing memory usage but instead make it so that this game will use all available memory and then just crash because it cannot pig out on anymore memory If Bluehole actually took the time to fix the problems with the games memory issues and not keep optimizing  gameplay  this game would be so much better,positive
this game suck now they make the system requirement like a suck wtf gtx 960 ,negative
I love PUBG but I hate all the chinese people getting to the American servers cause their servers are to laggy Every now and then when I check my server placing I keep getting placed in Asia I get a solid 150mbs and 5 10 ping on my internet but that somehow places me in the Asia servers Not that it is horrible it s just that I get tired of trying to speak my level one Chinese to chinese people in American or non American servers I know this is a problem with all the servers across the world But I feel that it is worse in the Americas North and South America the same Great gameplay and most bugs fixed Thanks for the great game Brendan Greene and Blue hole for this amazing game And happy late new year,positive
Loved this game till they allowed cheaters to run wild in every game Nothing like spending 15 minutes looting then to get aimbotted from across the map They really need to do something about this or nobody will want to play this anymore,negative
It is nice game However lots of bugs,positive
I have over 700 hours and 100 wins in this game I would recommend this game to people who want to mess around and have fun but would not recommend it to someone who takes this serious This game has many small bugs and many annoying experiences that get you killed On the daily I get killed about ten times a day when I shouldn t be killed Eihter being lag or just a bug or just me taking on 4 other solo players that all want to attack me and not themselves,negative
This game is fun Plain and simple,positive
Good game Played a lot Lots of funNot anymore Way to many hackersNow PUBG corp has my money I only bought one copy Hackers buy many copies Hackers get banned so they will buy a new copy PUBG corp has a economic incentive not to fix the hacker problem on a permanant scale Don t buy until they fix it permanatly,negative
Great idea not such a great game Terrbile performance buggy and cheaters Wouldn t recommend it,negative
Fun game cheaters can make it difficult to love though,positive
I feel like I ve put enough time into this game to give it a reviewFirst off this game really does capture what it s like to be apart of a battle royale with its intense gun fights players being forced to come in closer to widdle down numbers and achieveing the ultimate chicken dinner Second this game is no where near perfect It s got many bugs and imperfections but this is by far the best game out there for this genre PROS  100 player servers to have an epic fight to the death Developers listen to the community and fall through with promises 2 beautiful maps to learn and to shed blood on Every match is different wether it be the weather loot spawns play zone locations etc Very good balancing between the weapons on the maps Optimization The most amazing chicken dinner you ll ever have VAULTING The panCONS Poor server performance the majority of the time  rubber banding teleportation delayed lootingopening doors Hit Reg The immense amount of cheaters  past 710 games I ve played I ve been killed by a cheater after the 10 update Consistant crashing for several users  Being launched from parachute on landing alot of the times Getting stuck on nothing when parachuting  Terrible close quarters fighting Players being banned for stream sniping The developers babying streamers who play their gameOther than that this game is worth the 30 price tag If you enjoy the battle royale genre it ll be a game you ll come back to over and over again,positive
Runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and isn t fun to play Better with freinds but then again anything is better with friends even say a good game something PUBG isn t You re better off finding something else to play,negative
Too much cheaters ,negative
Since the release of 10 there has been hackers that have killed me every game Please remove the ability to pick regions as well people should play in their region or not at all,negative
Game is awful Everyone hypes it up and then it s got worse controls than games I ve seen 7th graders code and no rhyme or reason to the mechanics Shooting someone doesn t always deal damage and there s no explanation for this random invincibility,negative

It s like Skyrim with a last man standing shooter being developed with community feedback Players must fight to locate weapons and supplies in a massive 8x8 km island to be the lone survivor This is not  BATTLE ROYALE,negative

Tired of waiting around for updates that never comes Audio in this game is an absolute joke If you re holding out in a house chilling and waiting for the next area on the map another player can sprint through the door and all around the house without you getting any audio queue s Never thought I was gonna say this but get fortnite instead It s free and it s not made by incompetent imbeciles like PUBG,negative
This game gets too much hate they are fixing things and at this point if you can t gt good fps or you lag a lot its because you need to ither upgrade your PC or internet service Some people are just not going to like this game especially if you are bad,positive
It s a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing rage game don t play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
Should retitle this game Hackerunknowns Slaughtergrounds Since the release of deathcam and the 10 launch I have noticed that probably 70  of the times I have died and thought it was suspiscious enough to review the deathcam it has been at least a recoil hack if not straight up aimbotsThe insanity of that percentile statistic should never exist in a game with competitive multiplayer and is the only reason I give this game a do not recommend I have over 400 hours invested and I don t consider myself very good at the game but that does not matter when skill is replaced by hacks more than half of the timeShould you never buy it  No This is a phenomenal and fun game especially with a group of friends who make the inevitable Hackerson McTeamwiper moments more bearable because at least you re socializing kind of  No game has ever incorporated stealth and camo so accidentally and perfectly as this game has  within realistic expectations There are some exceptions when targets are at extreme range  There is something in here for all styles of play  the fraidy cat survivalist who would rather let everyone kill each other and hope they can get a good vantage The brutish maniac who likes to rush in fists flying in hopes he might down somebody before getting a gun to finish them off The always popular sniper  you really need to learn how to use scopes in this game even if you don t want to snipe every match  The maps are expansive and fun to explore I personally wish I could spend more time just to get a look at all the pretty placesAll in all I don t regret buying this game I enjoy the experience but the very essence of the game  being a large PVP shooter is trying to win And going into every game with a 50  chance  and rising of losing to somebody who is cheating is making it not fun to play anymore I know I am not good but when I have zero chance of winning because some loser won t put in the effort to learn how to aim it saps all of the motivation to even playKeep an eye on the updates until you see something about a drastic reduction in hackers 15 million bans within the first month of the games official release should be enough to tell you how big this problem is in PUBG,negative
Big maps,positive
this game sucks I mean really sucks,negative
All the chinese players on the NA servers really ruin the game they team kill english players alot but other than that the game is pretty awsome and challenging for experienced shooters The new patch really helped and now the game is alot smoother and no rubber banding like before,positive
Where to start PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a tremendous game with some game breaking bugs If this game removes the loading screen freezes and getting kicked out of games without being able to reconnect it would score a 1010 There is quite the learning curve when beginning if you ve never played a battle royale game before Once you get the hang of gun control and game physics it s loads of fun It s also much more fun if you play with friends  if you have friends 910,positive
Bring back the restart buton,positive
Sold out to china and now had in game ads 010 will never play again,negative
Quite amazing game really like itBesides the update 12 I really like this gameYou start off with nothing in the beginning and go to houses and loot guns healing items and moreFight with 99 other players besides you using varieties of guns gun parts that are available to youOnly one winner fight your bestI like everything except sometimes the server is unstable and also the game crashing somewhat whenOverall I recommend this game if you are a hardcore FPS TPS fan that like challenging games,positive
Cheaters everywhere Block china please,negative
When I first got this game I thought the premise was amazing I generally enjoyed the excitement of firefights not seeing anything for ages and then boom your out However its got old the excitement just becomes frustration of long load times to start a match either drop in and dierespawn a lot or spend ages wandering around until boom what hit me graphically even on high settings its not the best What started out as a great idea to me is now mediocre at best,negative
Very fun and rewarding although the game has come out of early access it is still unfinished so fair warning but i d still recomend it,positive
I wanted to wait until this game was out of early access before saying anything so now that the developer considers this a finished product i can finally say with certainty that this game is unfinished as hellOr rather to say not unfinished but littered with problems that should have been fixed long agoCheaters abound Kill cam is unreliable making figuring out who is a cheater an absurd challengeThe Optimisation is complete crap yeah some people might say  well I dont have problems  well good for you your not the majority of people and unless your pc is top of the line this is gonna run like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  even on the lowest settings And the server connections are even worse So its lag on top of lag,negative

I have enjoyed this game and it has many fun moments but the problem is hackkers are making it nearly unplayable I understand the devs are letting BattleEye do its job but when you ve been 15 million hackers and I still need to report 1 in 3 games I play for an OBVIOUS Aim Bot or ESP it s becoming impossible to try and get the chicken dinnerhttps wwwyoutubecomwatch vw9eNW0HPPvchttps wwwyoutubecomwatch vuxEiEaUaYa4,negative

PUBG is a thrilling battle royale game where it s kill or be killed including your teammatesMany chinese players in this game unless you re chinese you re gonna have a hard time playing in squads and most of my games end up with me being killed by my teammates in squad better off playing with friendsThe gameplay itself is great though you go around looking for weapons and kill everyone in your sights the maps are great and the weapons are well balanced overall it s an OK game710Also                                    Many teamkillers BTW look at my screenshots,positive
i ll give you the run down as to why this is a horrible buy 1 it s 30 dollars for the game not really that bad 2 you get reward chest at 700 battlepoints which you grind to gainthat may be just a shirt 3 every reward chest after that you have to pay 250 per key to unlock the chests you rightfully struggled to earn now for the math 30 for the game250 per key at 6 keys a week total spent in first month  90 dollars  that includes the game if i bought in to this i would have bought this game THREE TIMES in the first month i say horrible purchase,negative
Fun game even if i haven t won yet   maybe with a few friends i ll get to taste chicken,positive
What would be cool is if the devs randomly placed zombies and or creatures in the maps I would love this,positive
unstable and unfun,negative
Very fun game when you get good and better when you play with friends PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS can also offer a competitive environment if you re in to that kind of stuff I have a positive experience with this game If you like shooter games and love multiplayer co op PvPvE then you will want to try out this gameBeing in early developing stages there are still many bugs and glitches in the game s software but the developers are always working hard to patch and fix errors in the gameThis game is also a slower paced more competitive than some of it s counterparts like H1Z1 or Fortnite s Battle Royale gamemodesI would say this is a very good game and a fun game to play with your friends serious or joking around Have fun,positive
OZMMMM,positive
I dont mean to be racist or anything but there are WAAAAAYYY too many chinamen in these dadgum servers I am SICK AND TIRED  of hearing these silly apple  employees  in their internet cafes speaking CING CHONG In conclusion i d give this game a solid 1   12 stars DONT BUY UNTIL THESE CHINAMEN ARE GONE,negative
I Think I m Paranoid       Ive only just started my journey with PubG at 20 hours This is a game filled with contradictions  Fast and slow paced stealthy and loud overproduced and underproduced they come together in a chaotic fish bowl grinding into each other to create something experimental and powerful like a gymnast not a bodybuilder  Its intimidating to say the least every match starting and ending in embaressment at least until it doesnt and you Winner Winner Chicken Dinner I havent gotten there yet My PubG experience has been one of narrow visioned paranoia from what I can only guess is feuled by the amphetamine drip of someone waiting around the next corner for you You have to move quickly with certainty and force to break through to your next ramshackled house filled with loot or the already looted Its a game that deserves to be played or attempted      With a game a popular as this is there tends to come some elitism Ive experienced it and there is no doubt that it doesnt deserve the reaction of This isnt a good game but keep playing because f_ck that elitism b_llshit Its worth your time but there are no easy roads for you f_ckers Happy Hunting,positive
fortnite is better constant death by team mates mike spam everywhere i go waste of money don t get it,negative
They ruined the feel of what pubg is supposed to be about The good ol  near perfect version of the game with the exception of a little lag is gone and forgotten by the devs They have our money and only released the game officially to prove that they can The broke many things including the gradient of their visuals as well as their 3d sound which now works significantly WORSE than the EA version I missed what pubg was and if that means that it would always be in EA then so be it I just want the game to feel good again,negative
I love the game it hasn t got boring after playing for hours and every match you get to top 20 gives a rush there are some bugs with the servers still but that is something you can expect fo a game this popular,positive

The bad  This game is still buggy after a years worth of development The game kills my microphone once or twice a week when the game crashes About half the games have at least one cheater in them The servers are pretty bad I quite often get shot from behind a wallThe good  The graphics are a little better than pre release I keep my GTX 1080 on low settings for smoother play The game can be good for building team skills The servers tend to stabilize after roughly 50  of the players are dead,negative

I have played over 300 hours of this game and I am finally giving it a review 1 I will say that this is still one of the best battle royale genre games out there With that being stated however this game has a very LoveHate relationship with most players so if you re not looking for that look elsewhere Overall the shooting is pretty decent the fact that they smurfed some of the guns is a lot better and the new scopes they added are amazing so at least I can say they are headed in a positive direction Just give us the new maps alreadyOh and all i m posting are the most recent cons because I don t want you to be reading for daysCONS They say they ve fixed the cheating however it seems like every other game someone sucks and has to use an aimbot to make themselves not suck  which even with aimbots they sometimes still suck WTF is going on with the crates you have to buy keys for at least make it an option to use battle points to purchase them and stop trying to rob the people who play this game Hope this helps  _ ,negative
It seems like a lot of people are having performance issues so here are my specs before I talk about how it works well for meEVGA 1060AMD FX 835016GB RAMI play on high   ultra settings excluding the AA or shadows I get 60 fps in most areasThe 10 release has made a huge difference in performance and I personally would recommend this game if you enjoy a pseudo realistic military sim battle royalePros Lots of fun especially with friends Wide open environments and a high replay valueCons Since the update I ve had more problems with the vehicles clipping into the ground and damaging as if I had rammed straight into a rock I can t matchmake with a teammate that speaks my language half the time It seems like every other player on the NA server is from China,positive

Pubg is one of the best shooters ive played so far this year and with the hours Ive put in I can not recommend this game in the current state Ive had 18 Chicken Dinners but something needs to be done with the ChineseKorean players Ive encountered many hackers ever since the game came out of early accessClean out the hackers and make people play in their own regions and youll have a hit Let the hackers play with the hackers,negative

A game I would call begrudgingly  iconic  in short if you play FPSs with friends this game is a necessary experience culturally and in general gaming I daresay another experience as communally important to streaminggaming audiences is a long way off Its not polished like Halo its not full of story like Halo but it is pervasive Gameplay is both intense and relaxing and that mixture is important It can be hilarious it can be serious The breadth of the emotions and experiences of this game are insane This was an accident this game wasnt meant to be played by millions so early And regardless of the call of hackers galore or performance issues Bluehole is taking the game into a state where it will be played by millions Please give this game a chance refund it if you hate it or feel cheated but give it a chance with you and another friend and I bet most people will be convinced 810,positive

A trash game which is full of cheaters,negative
Too many hackers No longer fun when people aimbot shoot through walls and know where you are at all times The reason for the huge amount of hackers is primarily caused by BP equating to cash money There is a large incentive to hack that goes beyond the fun of it It s likely a livelihood for some chinese people When you have the chance to get items purchased with BP that can be sold for huge amounts of real money there is no stopping the swarms of hackers,negative

not bad to playing,positive
The best multiplayer i have played Many people  including some of my friends disagree with that because of its repetitive nature or slow pace but i believe its individual s play style that matters The amount of game sense and attention this game requires grows exponentially as the game advances to finaleI know this game has still a long way of improvement to go but regardless of not so decent fps on decent pc s i would definitely recommend this game,positive
Laggy and buggy as hell but still fun regardless,positive
An all round sub par game I wouldn t recommend and don t understand the hype,negative
With 10 it s a lot betterNow buildings are loading faster A lot fasterNow it can work on 4gb RAM laptop with Intel I3 and AMD RadeonAdded a new map Miramam same size as ErangelNew vehicles and weapons like Revolver and lever action rifle Win94 working on 45APC bulletsAnd of course players that AFK and eject on the end of the map that you can easily kill and get 150BP at the start1010 would play againEDIT  Now i see why there were 10 players in one gamePlayers delete game files XD,positive

This game needs a major optimization update You guys say it is fully released but it is not I am a college student and don t have room for a huge pc I own a Lenovo Y700 with a gtx 960m and i7 6700 That is a 4gb grapics card yet my buddy with a 3gb 1060 is getting 100 fps on medium settings 1080p while I am getting 35 fps on ultra low with 720p I get it is a moblie processor and graphics so it will fall below on performance but seriously  I get 90 frames in games like Rainbow Six Seige Titanfall 2 etc The devs really need to expand their optimization So if you are unfotunatly a laptop gamer I wouldn t recommend PUBG right now,negative
Best Game Ever that will let you with no friends,positive
Very good game I am not a fan of shooters but this guy over herehas got my attention so bad 1010,positive
I think there should be a region ban 100   I did want to make my oppinion about why there are so many asians on the NA and EU servers though  IF you notice the Average Chinese hour wage is about 170h which means a single crate makes up 13 their hourly wage  So steps are as follows   Join server where you can easlily kill people  Win game  Get tons of BP  Get crates and sell them  RepeatOf course this may not acctually be the case but it seems highly probable to me  This is just a theory thoIf they fix some bugs optimization and region lock i d probably give this game a thumbs up,negative
I love this game but the chinese they sacare me They are taking over this game they need to stay on the asian servers Not to be racist but in a plane im a so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing tired of hering  OS MA U TA DO LA US TOM  from some bot This is not a rant but rather a cry for help,positive
9999999999999999999910 this game is so AMAZING that i keep going on it going on it and going on it and so and soit is realy challenging for you and your friends if you play with them its not like any other battle royale game its even better there is vehicles and so much you can do its the best game in the world in my opinion SO TRY IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR oh and there is so much more custimisation than any other game i have played so thats another reason to try it its amazing,positive
Great to play with your friends but can get boring by yourself also don t buy on xbox just don t,positive
Game itself is great but every single round has a bunch of modders and asians Until they get rid of people modding it it is not worth buying or playing,negative
I just hope this game has wider variety on the combat mechanism With shooting as 95  of the way of combat it does get boring and repeative after a while,positive
Game is not even finished Come on Nintendo fix your broken game Thank you,negative
Nice Game Addictive and Mind Blowing Also its fun,positive
It s more a time sink than a gameThis is a game that claims to be finished but is infact buggier than an ant hill has one of the most annoying communities on the internet The gameplay can go 1 of 3 ways   1 You hide in corner of a house sitting anwaiting for an unsuspecting player to fly into your metaphoracle spiders web for the whole game then when someone eventually does come along they blast you with a shotgun   2 You run from house to house building up an arsenal of weapons so great you rival North Koreas miltary only for you to be one shotted by a snipper out of no where At this point you realise life is meaningless and that you are wasting your limited time on this earth just as you press the play button to begin another match   3 You get destroyed by someone trying you tactic from option 1 but pulled it off and is now tea bagging you a shouting almost definetly racist things about you in the language of there choiceIf none of these sound appealling to you I recommend you avoid this game at all cost Now if you ll excuse me I m off to play another round for some reason,negative
The gameplay is alright but so far my experience with the servers suck It keeps putting me in asia servers even though I live in NA Then when I manually switch back to NA servers their all LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing asians anyway Can you guy do somekind of server enforcement or something these guys dont play as a team and cheat like no bodies business,positive
Seems super fun when you watch streams of the game but when you play it yourself it s pretty boring  at least imoNothing really wrong with the game  except for the optimization i just dont find it fun,negative

If you like lagging fps dropping and trash talking asians well you ve come to the right place game is terrible but I always find myself coming back to the game its like smoking weed for the first time you can t just do it once But other than the Lagging servers and crap FPS game isn t too bad just needs a lot more work Would I recommend this game  F  no I wouldn t its not worth the 30 bones,negative
good game really fun when you start the game it might be hard but it get easier as you play it for long time,positive
You know you want to get it,positive
Got so sick of this game with only one map Then 10 came out and the updated graphics and optimized it and now i get over 100 fps and it looks so much better with more maps 100  worth 30,positive
Played this for 27 minutes without seeing anyone else and then the blue wall of death raced past me and killed me There was nothing i could do to survive or interact with others The playmap is way too large and the wall of death is too fast When you cant run to the next small zone you have just wasted 20 minutes of your life Im getting my money back,negative

With all the millions of dollars this game has brought in you d think they d be able to fix something as simple as their server capacity but I guess not 50  of the time you try and start up the game the servers are too busy for you to even connect,negative
dont open game,negative
VEEEEEEEEERY NICE,positive

Overall a great game but it s bad when it comes to matchmaking cause when you try to get into squads all you get are a bunch of Asians who speak a totally different language than english in your North American server It s impossible to communicate and even harder to hear since they have their mics on open and are constantly talking If you can keep people in their own regions of the game it would make it a lot more fun to play with others but you are constantly stuck with your friends cause you have them or the screaming asians you choose,positive
Region lock and ping lock please fix your hacked game and keep the ching chong LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s on their own servers and not on ours Since the 10 release I feel like the game has gotten even worse than it was in the early access hell I m sorry but if you people can t fix the hacking squint eyes and at the very least keep them on China servers and off NA and EU and Oceania then I m just flat out uninstalling The new map is terrible the lag is making the game unplayable and the release to console was the stupid move you could ve ever made I do not recommend this game at this time because this game is a piece of complete garbage at the time of writing this Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bluehole or have another H1Z1 your choice,negative
I am very greatful for the addition of death cam and replays primarily for the fact that I can now confirm what many have already expected  the hacking problem is rampant in this game Is the game challenging  Yes Can it be fun  Yes The fact is though the game is thoroughly overrun with cheaters I have spent many hours on this game but at this point I cannot recommend buying it until drastic measures are taken to ensure an uncompromised gaming experience,negative
This game is not fun at all The gameplay is good enough but it s weird  there s no auto reload guns hard to find the maps too huge too much chinese players theand i don t know how to create a room it s confusing If this game a deathmatch multiplayer it will be better,negative
Its fun if you can get a gun in the first 30 seconds Otherwise your dead,positive
over 800 hours played they don t seem to care about the players Only money Hacking has been rampant Update made it so I could no longer even launch the game with a gaming rig Just overall Love the game But constantly let down by the developers,negative
Its nothing but a laggy game you get killed by lag not fun,negative
Piece of cancer that won t work Unless you don t want to have trouble getting into the servers or get stuck in LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing doorways with your friends  DO NOT GET THIS GAME Thank you  ,negative
Finally the 10 patch has been released and this is what i discovered so farStill huge amount of rubberbanding especially in the beginning of a matchThere are still plenty of cheaters in this game Its almost normal to meet then in every match towards the end New map is way way to bigBut hey vaulting is coolCommunication regarding the amount of cheating in this game from the developers is pretty much non existent Apart from the usual apologies no one knows whats being done to prevent the cheating invasion Warz died to cheatersH1Z1 died to cheatersMy prediction is that this game will die to cheaters aswellBuy at own risk,negative
Need good optimization,negative
was a great game till after the update now it crashes after the credit screen no matter what i try its broken,negative

Recommending picking it up as it s worth the current price especially if you have a few friends that play Its a serious blast in a group Solo is fun too but can be tiring But that s not to say there s no issues The game itself is still chock full of glitches and mechanics issues The servers still bounce around unpredictably There s still huge issues with hacking There s still huge issues with most of the servers being full of Chinese players  seriously can we get China its own servers already ,positive

this game is like hunger games where the walls get smaller and smaller until the survivors are in a circle 10m next to each other Its very intense and will scare you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  when u get suprised i guess thats all in the experience of playing this game Its very fun with friends I only have 2 cons for this game the servers sometimes lag for 1 3min and its very annoying Also if u have a pc that is identical to the minumum specs you might as well not get it Ive heard some ppl with gtx 760s and still cannot run this game For me i am running this game smoothly at 100fps 1080p ultra with a gtx 1080 and i7 4720HQ  26 GHZ The final con for me is that i think this game gets repetative very fast Its just the same thing every game Loot 1 2 houses find car go to center kill or get killed by a person u cant even see If you are planning to get this game find some friends to play with At this current state of the game it deserves a 7510 for me I hope the devs fix the issues i stated above and add more game modes guns and even maps to spice up the game a little The devs did a really good job at the game,positive

I ve played PUBG now quite some time 100h  alone and with friends and i definetly CAN NOT recommend this game for competitive players because it s just shtThe Servers are unreliable and unstable the gamephysics are ridiculous  301217the movement  for me is  slow  and  wobbly  and by taking a closer look at the gameconcept it consists 50  of luckBut that s just a problem  for me with Battleroyal games in general The start of every game and the end of every game consist  again in my opinion mainly of luck In PUBG  in difference to other Battleroyalgames you are able to decide where you want to start on the map but there is no garanty you get an AR or basically ANY weapon and also Zone luck is a huge topicYou might argue that i m just bad at this game and just fck up every round  dozens of wins and that s the reason why i can t recommend it BUT i play mainly Shooter  BF3 Bf4 Bf1 StBf1 StBf2 around 2000h playtime and im quite competitive so this game is nothing fo me And there are many problems that have nothing to do with Playerskill but with gameperformance and overall optimisation Because it doesnt matter how high end your PC is you get WAY TO low FPS for these graphicsI m sure there will be more performance updates but im talking about the current state of the game So in conclusion For some casual gamers this game can be fun but i recommend you watch this game on streams because PUBG is in my opinion a game what is ONLY fun to watch and not to play  Thx for reading even tho my english is not the best   ,negative

Where to start   First you get a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of bugs all the time   it include rollbacks texture issues sometime you re trying to pick an item more than 20 time and you can t your vehicule explode for no reason when driving  or because you hit a freaking tiny branch with it and more  Then you have cheaters every single game one shoting you from afar whithout any vision seeing you nickname over your character shoting through walls  And the hitbox clearly sux as hell from now you can t even shot people though a fence  Players have waited more than one year to finally be able to jump  yeah it s not like it s a basic video game move isn t it   And by the way none of this problems have found a solution within the recent updates it s like every update brings a new pack of bugs for you to enjoySeriously if you want a battle royal kind of game don t buy this one you ll waste your money your time and your patience,negative

Alright this is probably the most difficult review I ve ever had to doFirst of all  This IS a good game and NOBODY can disagree with thatThe main problem with PUBG is the kind of people who play this game they make this game get frustating and boring because you never get to win this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I ve played almost 40 hrs of this game with my friends and I have never won a single LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing match because there s always a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chinese hacker or a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sniper on a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bush  fanboys will say I suck at this game but I don t when I play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  alone I alway get to be top 20 and with friends top 10I can t even say that if you like FPS s like CoD or BF you ll like this game for sure because on those games at least you get the pleasure of winning at least sometimes which doesn t happen with PUBG  unless you re a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 1 ton fat nerd who doesn t have social life and play at least 8 hrs of this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game everyday So for all the matter I give a final review of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 5510 on this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I said the game is good and it is but the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing players make it become a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  And just one more thing about this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  HACKERS HACKER EVERY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING WHEREEEEEE I DIED TO A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HACKERRRRRRRR,negative

I have well over 600 hours between this server and test server I really like this game Despite the bugginess the absolute trash parachute mechanics that have been in place since inception the wonky physics hiccups I still like it I HATE one thing though They want to do what CS GO does and have key restricted crates I am currently ona  streak of 6 key crates pulled ina  row That means that basically two weeks of gameplay have given me items I can t access without paying more real money I can t stand it I feel cheated for my in game points to just pull these garbage 250 crates Right now it is just a major annoyance and not a deterrant but it might be enough down the road to push me to another gameBlue Hole needs to step up and do something They have the money so I don t know what is holding them up,negative
it can be fun but its not rewarding at all,positive
bluhole fix yo LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,positive
It s a good game overall a bunch of bugs but they re overall manageable Currently there is an influx of chinese hackers in the game soooo you might get hit by a flying boat or punched from the other side of the map but you could wait until they fix that or just keep playing like my group does I think the game will be fantastic when they solve that problem though I would recommend overall for when it gets better,positive
The Chinese,negative
Good game to play solo and with friends I would recommend playing it for sure however even after implementing BattleEye protection for cheaters there are still mass amounts of cheaters which make it near impossible to win  REGION LOCK CHINA ,negative

Well what can i say  The idea is very good The game conceptually does a good job doing what it set out to do But the technical side is abesolutely terrible The interface feels like from an early 2000s game It feels like i m playing Counter Strike 16 again The movement is just as bad with no ducking in cover no dodging But you know i am ready to overlook all that The game is playable despite those shortcomings But the biggest issue by far is that the game is not capable of running a map so big with so many players on it It feels like it s designed for a map 20 times smaller with 10 players on it The lag is unbelievable When the game starts rubberbanding is inevitable Later on in the game even when the number of players goes below 40 hit registration is completely out of whack and laggy To be good at this game you have to aim with lag in mind which is just ridiculousIn conclusion the game is playable depending on how low your resistance to frustration is It is pretty stable i would say I only got maybe 1 crash for every 40 games i played and only once did it happen while in the actual session so it s not bad from that point of view But this game has absolutely no business being out of beta No way The core game mechanics are not finished If you want to play a relatively fun game that s still in beta then go for it If you re expecting a v10 game this is not it,positive
Its a awesome game but it still has a long way to go the lagg is crazy sometimes also sometimes you play your rank 6 and then an error accured right great lol so the game i tink is really good but still has a long way to go to make it run propperly i give it a 6 so far cause of the many bugs,positive
this game is just awesome,positive
I have almost 500 hrs on this game and i can state that it has it fair share of issues but it doesnt take from the fact that it is the best battle royale game money can get you,positive

With the 10 patch I have had a rock solid 60 fps experience with y 1070 Love the feeling of winning a chicken dinner If on the fence afrter hearing concerns with early access issues id say give it a try and have some intense fun,positive

Ever since the new PUBG update came out this game has ran like a dream on my pc I can run it at 1440p low medium settings on my RX 460 Would be nice to see more maps maybe a winter map or jungle map in the future,positive
I JUST GOT 2 SHOT THROUGH A WALLI watched the replay a few times and the killer never had sight of me not once They just aimed at the wall and killed me with 2 shots I had a level 3 helmet and 1 or 2 body armor WITH FULL HPI would uninstall but I payed 30Don t waste your money unless you don t care about HAX like the one above I don t know why people would want to win this way but it simply killed the game for me I would give the game 4 stars 5 if they included an open world or even a shooting range WAY too much time is wasted between deaths in this game but do to the hax I will just not rate itDo some research on the hacking problem before commiting to this game,positive
After owning PUBG for a long time and Fortnite as well I just can t recommend this over Fortnite The guns are too complex  not to mention just straight up bad with no practice mode the game is riddled with glitches and bad servers and worst of all it s just plain stressful It s shameful to see that a paid game is not nearly as enjoyable as a free oneOLD REVIEWThere s so many key features missing from this game to make it actually enjoyable To name a few the game needs    Practice mode  so i can figure out what the guns actually do   Those little blood circles  the things from every other FPS that tells you where you re getting shot from Although the replay cam is nice I d prefer to be capable of figuring out who s sniping me from what corner of the map   Balance   M4 is way too weak pistols tooI can t recommend this game over Fortnite I still regret paying 60 dollars for this when there s a better game that did it for freeEDIT  It was 30 dollars Still a valid point though,negative
This game is complete bull LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  come backl to me when you can a ctually provide a decent game where the meta isn t to just camp with a shotty all game and when you can t be hit from LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing no where,negative

I tried for 4 HOURS to get this game to work I uninstalled then reinstalled I changed files to admin I checked that all the files were there through Steam I repaired all the C files I searched through every single community forum I checked all official posts I really wanted to play this game but it just wouldn t work so I have to get a refund When I looked for maybe a support page from either Steam or PUBG all I could find was a link to forums Really after all the money you get from this game blowing up you can t even make a support line  Not happy with this game or PUBG s service,negative

Greedy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    A true personal story from the experience I Hate My Father Brendan Greene With a Passion I hate my father Brendan Greene I mean i literally hate him Since the day i was born bought PUBG everything about him has been about child steam support He s one of those people who would sell one of their own children garbage for 20 2999 trust me and he would wouldn t do it for less evenif he had to This man has put me my brother and my mother through hell I understand that child steam support for your children game after a divorce playing for 2 hours can be challenging  010 Gave me depression,negative

It hurts to play so i guess im a massochist,positive
A lot of campers If you leave your building expect to be killed instantly by a cheeto eating looser who doesnt even leave his building to loot your items because he is too scared to be shot and killed Cant pick up items at start of game Melee fights is a complete death wish You click and half a second later you punch and melee range is about 01 meters Overal a bad game but has a huge potential to be a good one,negative
I have enjoyed the game and the concept However as it stands the game is not worth your time due to the amount of cheating on all serversregions It feels like the situation is rapidly spiralling out of control for the developers I have come to expect a small amount of hacking in all competitive FPS games but the replay and deathcam feature has revealed that it is a severe issue Playing a game where I do not suspect cheating now only occurs in a minority of cases I ve moved to other similar games now where the situation is a more level playing field At this rate I think gaming history will only remember PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds as a case study in development and popularity and I can imagine that soon enough more games of this type will enter the market with better anti cheating features and more stable optimisation,negative
good and fun,positive
Most F cking Game I ve Ever Played In Steam,negative
If you fully understand that this is an alpha game then it s amazingyes it has bugs yes it has glitches but that end game circle feeling is unrivaled5 star game for me,positive

If you cant understand chinese in full you can not play this game Also tons of bugs still Cars are messed up If the China problem is not fixed there is no point in this game Kinda pointless when your team can t understand english even though their on  a NA server Fix the damn problem it s not that hard Use either an IP sorting program or make it to were if you want to play on a server you have to pass a languange test Just have the player read a paragraph and pass it NA English CA Spanish EU All languages that apply so on and so on,negative
I loved this game before the patch but now I love it even more Good balance of weapons and vehicles An armored vehicle without a gun would be nice like a money truck or an APC that can absorb more damage but not be as fast would be nice I d also like to see more players in servers but this is 110  worth the month,positive
Good game 910,positive
A good workout for your Gpu and Cpu to stay in shape too bad Australian summer is not your friend,positive
Unbalenced broken physics and full of try hards without any ranking system I have no idea why people put os much hype behind this game,negative
Mmmmits badIt feels sloppyNo strategy like in CSGOm4  silencer  scope  undetectable can kill up to 2 64 enemies from behind a bushgraphics used to be good now I find it hard to classify a black dot into categories  enemies  and  rocks bushes trees etc  Might as well need some LSTM deep learning to help me with itCan I give it back ,negative

What a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game  u litteraly have 1m people playing this game but cant buy better servers  When u spawn u cant even move cuz of the lagg  i get killed alot of times cuz the lagg in the start game,negative
After playing this game for almost 50 hours I have come to the conclusion that it is a great game  It s immersive challenging and a good time with or without friends  You also don t need an amazing PC to play as I m running it on a Dell gaming laptop  The game has come a long way in performance and with the release of the actual game it s the time to pick it up,positive
BUG G,negative
Optimization would be nice so just wait for optimization,positive
So i doubt anyone who can change this will see this or care to respond but the most upsetting thing about this game right now through my eyes which I hope you don t take offense to is that i m in the North American region and the majority of the people that I can speak to through game chat are from one of several Asian countries This causes a problem because most of the majority don t speak English  I understand that Spanish and French are also North American languages Sometimes I even find that the game has switched me over to the Asian region which irritates me because i have chosen the North American region several times and it still switches back everytime I restart the game If someone does see this I enjoy playing this and fully recommend that anyone who has both the money and the power buys this I understand that it has only just come out of Early Access and perhaps in the future this might have some fix if even possible Thank you for your time anyone and everone who has read this and again I don t mean for this to be taken as a demand for some patch but more as me hoping you might consider what I ve said,positive
At its current state I would not recommend this game to anyone It is a hack infested piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that the devs don t seem to care about fixing There has been 0 patches in awhile that are focused on its anti cheat and at the moment that s what is going to kill this game If you buy this game have fun being aimbotted by multiple people in 910 games Hell i d go as far to say every single one of your games because that s currently what it feels like Don t buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  until the dev s start giving a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about the community and not just money,negative
Runs Like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and for the most part gameplay is boring as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
Roses are redViolets are blue I killed my parentsAnd so will you,positive
I have to say very underwhelmed with this game I really think most of the people who play this havnt played GTA or Rust Both are better games and have game modes that are nearly identical to this game  Only bought this because literally everyone owns it Its not all bad it probably deserves a neutral review but honestly I see this game dead by the end of the year,negative
I love this game and its a lot of fun I certainly enjoy it more than Fortnite BUTIt has a ton of issues should not be considered a full game go into this game thinking of it like a Beta or even Alpha gameSome of the issues ive had   and this is as of 1112018 Hackers a lot of them Can t customize character or earn BP  currency in game Stats don t save for some reason Throws me into Asia server by default for some reason  I live in US And as of 10 patch 2  happened just today can t even matchmake we ll see if that changes thoughBut im sure theres other stuff that happens that either I don t notice or don t remember Also if you have any of these issues don t count on tech support  they either take a very long time to respond or send the automated message telling you to do all the basic stuff  turn it off and back on and when you tell them that doesn t work they don t respondBut otherwise great game needs a lot of work though,positive
You might want to forget about Unreal Engine and maybe make your next game with cryengine Unreal Engine has ALOT of optimization issuesLove the game just hate the servers and the optimization,negative
Yea this game has its issues but has an active team constantly trying to make it a better game to play i ve logged around 150hours so far and most of it has been super enjoyable the random crash now and then can be upsetting but this is by far my favorite battle arena game 1,positive

Playerunknown s Battlegrounds PUBG A game where you gather loot and then fight to the death When playing solo racking up on gear and then dying is really frustrating Meanwhile with friends dying is also annoying but not nearly as much The game can get boring by yourself but when you re with friends it s really fun,positive

My Grandfather smoked his whole life I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him  If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate you have to stop immediately  Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake He gave it up immediately Three years later he died of lung cancer It was really sad and destroyed me My mother said to me   Don t ever smoke Please don t put your family through what your Grandfather put us through  I agreed At 28 I have never touched a cigarette I must say I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this game gave me cancer anyway,positive
very good game i havent played a lot but u can feel the good vibe from it,positive
I love this game I understand why people gave it such bad reviews what bluehole did with the server ads was wrong But the game itself is fantastic Since the new update its been much smoother and the new map is well thought out This is one of the more fun games on steam Worth the buy especially if you have people to play with,positive
It is a great game Kinda like a hunger games with guns  n stuff Totally worth thirty dollars,positive
Brilliant FOUNDATION for a game however disheartening to see such an influx of cheating This does not remotely seem to be a priority for the devs and i cannot see a fix anytime soon this infestation of hackers across all reigons makes the additional performance issuses relatively minor if not forgettable This game was cleaner and therefore better in early access bugs are fun hackers are not If you are to play this game grab asmany frag grenades as possible its the only chance you ve got,negative
You better settle the early game lagsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game bad module stop many times and after that cannot continue the match LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

Wellto be honestim new to this kind of  Battle Royale  game but I really enjoy it and I think that PUBG is doing a great jobBut Bluehole needs to work harder at their game so we can enjoy a smoother gaming experience10 is outbut the game is not done yet and we need to be patientOverallI recommend this game but I also think that PUBG needs a lot of time to grow even bigger than is right now,positive
This game is garbage and NO i am not LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing butthurt because i lost or anything This game has so much apprasial because middle schoolers can watch their favorite twitch streamers play it and spam BIBLETHUMP and OMEGALOL into chat but in sincereness this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing aids The combat system is  SO VERY TERRIBLE  along with basically everything else in the game such as vehicles graphics balancing  the list goes on for the love of god do not waste your money on this mistake of nature,negative

I have to say I played this game for a while solo and was kinda like meh but I was behind the curve because I got it lateI have recently started playing with friends and it is a totally different experience and so much fun  I would definitely recommend it  Whether you play solo or with friends  I enjoy playing solo because I only worry about me and often make it to the top three but it is such a different experience with friendsI see a lot of people complaining about hackers I have yet to deal with an instance of hacking although I am sure they exist  I really enjoy the newest update and other than some initial problems with the menu loading I have no issues nowHighly recommend and add me if you want to play,positive

This gamea and the programmers are stupid They can t handle the server load and make everyone download the updates at the same time causing a flood of people trying to sign on wasting my time because Blue Hole is staffed with a bunch of idiots Poorly thought out with no respect to the players time who paid the f ing money Wish I could tell these idiot developers in person how stupid they are,negative
It is a pretty good game other then thier servers are bad but they have been getting better I would recommend this game only if you have someone to play with The solo is very boring alone,positive
This game was fun for me for the first hour and a half but then all of a sudden I can t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE THERE IS AN ADVERT THAT TAKES UP THE ENTIRE SCREEN,negative
I have had countless hours of fun throughout early access and now that the product has officially launched For anyone who has thought about getting this game but been on the fence about it I recommend the purchase There s a learning curve though it won t be something you can just drop into and expect to be the best Once you get over that curve though it s worth it I was not a huge shooter fan before deciding to purchase this and I can say that I ve gotten more than my moneys worth out of it and expect to get a lot more enjoyment out of it,positive
One day PlayerUnknown was working on H1Z1 and came up with some fantastic ideas for improving the game yet was rebuffed by his superiors in the company So he went home determined to one day create his own game and make Battle Royale games great againA few days later he was visiting his grandmother in hospital and out of the blue said  Nan do you know anyone who can code   Yes my neighbour s grandson had a BTEC in IT And thus PUBG Corp was born,positive

Doesnt deserve a 10 yet Still way to buggy to many cheaters and to much lag Also the Devs are more interested in selling you new Lootboxes instead of fixing the game Cheaters wont get banned and hacks are normal in this game and no one cares Devs proudly announced that they banned 15 MIllion Account which is A not a lot for those sales numbers and B doesnt solves it the issues Every Hacker buys a new account in seconds nowadaysBattleye have already tweeted out that I think around 99 percent of cheats in the game right now are coming out of China said Brendan Greene PUBGs creative director in an interview with Kotaku   thegamercomRegionLockChina,negative

I ve been playing since May 2017 and have been waiting until 10 to make this review First off I love this game It s pretty fun crazy tough and really a good time if you have freinds to play with I have been seeing alot of hate about hackers and game breaking bugs I have not had these issues the only thing I ve had issues with is when the textures don t load but that was due to my incredibly slow hard drive After upgrading to an SSHD the game runs great I play at about 40fps which isnt great but its workable As for hackers I have ran into very few over the past 8 months Also these game breaking issues people are having with the game just aren t there for me and my friends If you like battle royales and want a good game that is constantly getting updates PUBG is for youAs for the specs on my system if you care AMD Fx 8320 Black EditionAMD Rx480 Strix Edition16Gb RAMand I have the game loaded on a seagate SSHD,positive

Please fix the game as soon as you drop you face five minutes of rubberbanding and you have a high probability of dying since you can t run more than five feet The beggining of the game is one of the biggest determining factors of the game so if you can do anything for the community at least fix the lag in the begginging,positive

Well I finally bought a decent PC and I also bought this game The unique problem of this game in a nutshell is   Playerunknows badly optimizedPlayerunknowns Shotgun Only and also Playerunknows bugs grounds  I don t know how this game got in The Game Awards this year It s a good game not more than that                                         NICE GAME BTW 810,positive
Not worth my time and irritating in its mechanics,negative
The game is hard on new players and can be unfun when you don t know what to do however with a team of great players you can easily have a fun time once getting saddled in A tutorial is needed and more cosmetics but other then that the game is somewhat good in my books,positive
Winner winner chicken dinner You guys know what changed between test servers and launch day  The game runs worse nowI m torn on rating because this still feels like early access yet I ve invested over 100 hours with no end in sight and for the 2999 I paid back when it launched  the first time not this  10  version I guess it s worth itStill needs work on lag early round rubberbanding hackersaimbots etc but the potential for great fun exists I crash a lot too sometimes as often as 3 times per round but barring anyone shooting me in the face while I m frantically rebooting the game I m usually able to resume where I left off I d prefer that this didn t happen but at least I can rejoin a match in progressEdit 122917  Rubberbanding was improved in a patch last night Still some connectivity issues servers too busy etcEdit 1418  In place of rubberbanding there is now just a fairly large item pick up delay at the start of matches Visually less annoying but annoying nonetheless This is also the only game that causes my system to CTD or blue screen even  Windows you suck for putting a frown face emoji on that screenEdit 51318  I have a lovehate relationship with this game I stopped playing for 3 months because my system would CTD or flat out BSoD I ve had this rig for 4 years and this is the ONLY game to cause BSoD I reinstalled the game on my SSD and have to run my fan full throttle to prevent my system from overheating even with lowered graphics I am by no means running a potato and recently doubled my memory to 32gb and popped in a GTX 1080 There are 2 maps now which is nice but fog and rain are now gone A 3rd map is en route but I miss playing in thunderstorms Cheating  Still bad Anti cheat patches are sometimes worse than the cheatingStill I play and I have moments of crazy fun I m teetering in the edge of a thumb s down because content is starting to be removed Also I am very angry about the crate system and the 250 keys required to open most of them C mon guys at least leave a 100  free option to buy with in game BP rather than a random chance of getting a free crate but more likely a crate that requires a paid key to open This seems greedy for a game that sold so many units I think I am going to give that thumb s down afterall BRING BACK MY RAINSTORMS,negative
bought game loaded it tried to start game crash try every fix i can find crash what a crock of s  t      HINT HINT PLAYER UNKNOWN DEVELOPERS FIX THIS GAME,negative
Since the 10 release it has been unplayable for me while living in China I cannot play a round without getting a server connection error  on all servers while playing or loading into the waiting area It is SO infuriating for a game that is multiplayer only and you have paid money for FFS Blue Hole get your act together I cannot recommend this game for anyone playing within China for the time being,negative
its a revouloution in the gaming industry it s a good game only problem is its over priced i would ve kept it if it was 10   20 dollars  keep in mind im from Australia so i had to pay 50 dollars for this game new update  its so laggy all the servers are ridded with people who speak an asian languagei couldnt understand anyone apart from japanese players coz i learned how to speak japaneseso pubg corporation pls fix the servers and the lag,positive

Too much waiting for too little action Has the most anticlimatic and boring gunplay thats unresponsive in the time you need it the most,negative
There s too many things that need fixing rn tbh This game s literally still in alpha with the amount of problems it has such as some poor server performance which results in many problems really rubber bands bad hitreg damage not being properly calculated and im sure there s more problems but those are the ones I found most important and common Another thing they need to fix is either the logic or the bugs because i ve had times where i take damage from just parachuting in The fact that you can t ram a car into another car to kill the people hiding behind it or the fact that hitting someone a teammate at literally 5 kmh killsdowns them while as hitting an enemy with that either does nothing or does nowhere near the same amount of damage Another thing i ve found damage and whatnot needs to be reworked as some guns don t make sense in terms of how an SMG using either 9mm or 45 can still do the same damage as AR s with 556 and 762s Plus the frag is really the only grenade used due to issues with the other grenades such as the stun grenades not properly stunning molotov just being a small AoE even if thrown on grass or at a person no DoT The smoke grenades don t really cover an area well at all or properly TLDR  Game needs a lot of work still It should still be in alpha,negative
Great game that I highly recommend I enjoy every second of it It s trilling action packed goodness that is certainly provides an even better experiance with friends It is a must buy if you can run it on your pc,positive
runs a lot better after 10,positive
Only buy this game if you truly have a good graphics card or else its not enjoyable at all because youre running it 20 FPS even on everything configured to low settings,positive
As much as I enjoy playing this game with friends around 75  of the time at it s current state  10 Release Version The game is not in any way worth purchasing it s a glitching broken mess with constant server issues and a rampant hacker epedemic I ve played since early access so I d like to think I have a decent idea of what the game is like The new map feels okay to play it s a little too far spread out in comparrison to the first one for my liking From my experience the large majority of players  on Oceanic and some other servers are Chinese hackers who hack to win to sell the items they recieve from the crates for money Voice chat is a delight hearing Chinese players yell  CHINA NUMBA ONE  over and over again as they hack their way to victory Update Edit They ve fixed the rubber banding issues but as far as I know the hacker problem is still fairly rampant this can be combatted though if you play in first person upon initially writing this review we soley played third person Although you can still encounter hackers in first person it s MUCH less likely The game is still really glitchy and still mostly a broken mess If your friends play it and you can look past this I d reccomend it otherwise go give fortnite a shot it s pretty fun and isn t anywhere near as broken as thisTL DRThis game is still pretty broken although they are working to fix the problems Avoid for the time being I ll edit the review if things change and if I remember to,negative

I Played this game before i got fortnite it was fun for the first 5 hours of it the gameplay is so slow and everymatch i look for someone to kill and i cant find anyone anywhere as in fortnite i sometimes get annoyed of how many people i find the game is to slow the map is so big which makes the game slow paced i wasted 60 dollars because i got this game on xbox and its even worse i reccomend this to no one unless they want torture from being bored I Dont like reading but reading a damn book is more fun than this gameEDIT  I played this game during the early access before pubg showed how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stupid they are by suing a game that is far from similar to this peice of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Ever Since PUBG tried to sue fortnite i lost all respect for pubg,negative

Addictive gameBut there is too much bug please fix it,positive
I d have to say that this game is quite amazing that being said there are still many flaws that need to be worked out and i believe that the game shouldn t have been released as and early access game quite yet but i still believe the game is more than worth it for 30 as of now yes it has it s problems but it has lots of fun and action to offer they ve been working hard to optimze the game and get it where it needs to go they ve also listned to the feedback from the players and given their words thought so i would totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys scavanging for supplies and always being on your toes to win that chicken dinner,positive
Very fun and unique Should be even better with the continued support,positive
1 minute of desync sometimes coming out of plane at times developers don t care or are unwilling to spend any money on netcode Hackers in every game and suprise surprise they are all chinese dont lock them all on a server where they can see who has the best aimbot I like the battle royale genre but it seems like we are all just waiting for something as realistic as pubg with actual polish and not all purchased assets Player Unknown is the same guy who charged 60 for DayZ then jumped ship when he realized he wasn t very good at what he wanted to do He wants to sue anyone who wants to make a battle royale game because he founded the idea of battle royale but then states we need more battle royal games I won t lie 10 added alot the game needed mostly the vaulting that really is just a quality of life improvement and actually making artillery sound real Heres hoping that someone who knows how to create a good game taps into the market soon Until then we are left with this unoptimized carcass of a good idea given to inept hands,negative
The game is great fun amazing gameplay and suspense I love playing this with friendsBut it gets a negative review from meDev team is a joke the creator is a greedy closeminded azzhatGame is unplayable if you play alone in duo or squad mode as you ll get teamkilled for not being chineseChinese invade other servers to gain ping advantage  ping abuse etcBut bring up the topic and you get labeled as racist and xenophobic by the own creatorI do although recommend Fortnite until the devs pull out the chinese cash out of their azzez and fix their game,negative

Don t know if its something that is just happening  to me and my friends but I realised with my last 4 dinners  2 duo and 2 squad that I  we havent received any points 2000 for the wins that was almost a week ago after the 10 update  Haven t played in about 3 days and when I checked now the points were still not rewarded    Come on I need those points to buy chests so that I can get 5 of the same worthless items  Going to give a thumbs up but only because the game is still fun regardless,positive
This is a good game and overall a game of which I would recommend It s popular for a reason and that s mainly due to the overall fun and joy you experience while in this game While some play this for casual gaming and others for competitive purposes you can t go wrong with PuBg While I will admit I haven t played much of this game on the subject of time from what I have played I had an enjoyable experience Sure it isn t the absolute greatest game to ever exist it s just fun Besides is there really a  best game ever   It is better to play with friends as solo does get a tad tiring after too long of it If I were to give this game a rating I would give it an 87 out of 10,positive

This game s developers are realy bad They release the game as a full release but there are so many servers are full errors and the game just closes while playing They ask so much for a game and have sold so many copies and yet they cant even get a South African server  This game has so many flaws even people playing competitive are tired of all the bugs and consider leaving the game I would not recommend this game anytime soon So much time wasted and my money,negative

The game is now in 10 and I have to say that none of the things I heard about it before have changed While there was a period in which I accepted the game as being Early Access that time long passed before the devs decided to arbitrarily call the next version of their game 10Gameplay  PU may have been the first to make a battle royale mod but theres just way too much competition in the marketplace for me to say that this game does anything special In fact the gameplay kind of sucks   its like playerunknown and his korean development team ported the unresponsive movement of ARMA3 when they made the game It underperforms if you put it into it s context among all the other battle royales out there Don t pay 30 dollars for this gameplay experience which is still full of bugsVisuals  not a visually appealing game the technology isn t the worse  on unreal engine but nothing about the design seems to be working The user interface looks amateurish like and unskilled and lazy application of flat design More than that it ports over a lot of clunky control concepts from arma as well Character models are totally uninteresting and unappealing  wearing basic clothes and being pretty indistinctive I m not asking for cartoony design but if you look at other first person shooters their models can have detail and character without breaking the concept of realism Here it s like looking at Rust character models except without the hilarity involvedPrice  30 dollars was too much for me to pay but friends convinced me After the first game I would have refunded I should have refunded But the second game was actually kind of fun I continued playing At this point I ve won at least one solo match one squad match and have played quite a few duos At no stage in this game was I feeling like I paid the correct amount for one procedurally genearted mapSome might say 30 dollars is a fair price because you can play the same map over and over again for eternity But you can also buy a chess set and play that forever The amount of time that you play a game has little to do with the price it deserves You pay money for well crafted experiences   you pay money for good design good art good content This game has none of that And the desert map doesn t really change anything about it,negative
Has Some Flaws But Overall Is a Great GameThe game has some things messed up with it For one the  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  is a lie You are gonna need a very beefy computer to run this game even on medium You gonna want atleast 16 gigs of RAM and a very beefy graphics card It isent a very Processor killer like some other games So a i3 or anything higher is good but graphics is a big deal I tried the game a PC with 12 gigs of RAM and a i7 had a poor graphics card and that ruined the game got 25 frames on all low still playable but looked awful and made things alot harder I am using a prebuilt gaming computer and getting 60 80 frames on medium and so far loving the gameThe default server for every player is the NA servers and alot and I mean ALOT of players don t know this and don t go to their server and make it very hard to play with teammates that dont speak english You are mostly going to deal with Russian and Asian players they try their best to communicate with you but in the end this is the games fault for not putting them on their serversYou are going to deal with alot of hacker I heard it is worse in servers near Asia and Europe but I still had to deal with alot here in America Wallers are the most common ones If it happens you cant do much but review the deathcam and report them they should add more optionsBut other then the cons this a great game if you have a group of buddys to play with you can drop down in a squad and have a crapton of fun I Recommend it to anyone with a Good PC and some patience for cheaters and people that won t speak english,positive
Got an average gaming build from 2013 and I run this game totally fine I m aiming for 100 FPS because I play on a 144hz monitor You can tweak the settings in the settings menu if your PC is struggling as with most games I don t play it every day and I don t expect it to keep me entertained 16 hours of everyday the next 5 years In PUBG I expect and want a challenging but most of all fun experience to play with friends I expect there to be bugs and issues in an early access game  if there wasn t then I would ve been suspicious since that is the reason a game isn t officially released yet I also expect and accept issues and minor bugs in a released game I expect new bugs to be introduced along with patches I understand that a game is an ongoing piece of work and that unless the developers locked in current features forever and only focused on having a bugfree game it won t be perfect everIf you have the same expectations and desires as me then I think you re going to enjoy PUBG in its current state I ve had some great fun so far every of the 46 hour I ve spent so far on this game has been exciting and if the game died right here then I still would ve considered my investment good value 46 hours of joy for 30 euros is not a bad deal in my eyes I d pay 30 euros for just 5 hours of joy I d pay 300 euros for an hour of joy if I felt like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PUBG is a good game for me it is way up there on the list of awesome games It is the first of its kind that I truly have enjoyed and I expect to have a lot more fun coming out of my 30 euro investment so I am very happy with my purchase I would give it a 1010 despite the fact that I can find flaws if I really want to but I don t care about technicalities I don t care if the game ends up being unstable or laggy for a week I ll play it next week I care about being entertained and PUBG has not failed at that yet,positive

I don t really understand the fuss regarding this game Its overrated as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Buggy piece of mess No polish what so ever U wait 15 mins only to be killed by someone pixel shooting u from somewhere u didn t even see The concept is not bad maybe it will get better but right now I don t like it Just personal opinion,negative
great game one of my favorites,positive
 AAA  company that earned millions can t even make a game without major bugs Servers are laggy as hell in lobby and game until some people dies because the server can t handle peopleCheaters don t get banned even with killcam as a proof Many people use no recoil scripts and can t get banned because it s a mouse scriptSo for a while just check out another game and let the devs of PUBG waste their hard earned money on a PUBG movie instead of buying servers,negative

I wont leave a bad review but this game is not what should be considered finished and ready for shipping  Simple and arcade gameplay that involves also skill makes this BR game standout and fun ARMA is too hard for me in terms of controls      About every 5th match rubberbands for me what makes that match unplayable Happens in old map too since introduction of the vaulting and new sounds etc that big patch Was not happening before I would like to see achievements and trading cards for a game of this popularity Some emoticons and backgrounds for steam I think thats it for me If the game run smooth no doubt it would rock im not saying that you wont get worth of your money but the struggle is real Fix asap plsnot for easily triggered  beware of cheaters,positive

Fun intense and tatical game When people said about hackers  infesting  this game I was skeptical however since the 10 launch and the addition of the kill cam I can clearly see this is unfortunatly the case Twice it a matter of just a few games was I killed by someone who had a clear advantage through hacking Hopefully they will be able to weed out the hackers so the rest of us can enjoy the battlegrounds At the current time with the player base as it is I would have to not recommend this game if they exterminate the infestation the game will once again be something special and I would then recommend this game wholeheartedly,negative
This game is getting worse as time goes on  10 is unplayable due to bad rubber banding Seriously 6 months to sort out server issues should be enough  Hackers and more hackers 2 out of 5 games seem to have them It s even worse if you make it to top 5 and get killed by one  Laggy players from other server areas are causing more lag Players need to be blocked from playing in other regions,negative

The game itself is good and in any other case I would recommend it butI was falsely banned by the devs Not one of those  my brother was playing and he cheated I swear it wasn t me  or  oops I left my mods for  other game  running  false bans but a straight up  I logged on and was banned  banInnocence is impossible to prove but I know what my situation is and nobody else does so if you happen to read this and think  obviously you were cheating  then you can stop hereHowever what really ticks me off about this false ban is the developer s refusal to cooperate I have made support tickets on both their forum and their official helpdesk and in both cases my response was simply  our evidence supports the initial ban claim it has been reviewed and the ban will stay  What evidence  Supposedly they can t provide evidence as  hackers can use it to their advantage  I think the reality in my case is that there is no evidenceI have clearly been banned by some kind of false flag in their anticheat BattlEye as one look at my statistics or a typical game would show you that I m not even that great at the game I highly doubt someone saw my behaviour and reported me So this automated system assumedly has me banned and the support staff thoroughly believes that it can do no wrong GreatThere are tons of false ban reports out there on the Steam forums for this game on their official forums and in just about every reply to BattlEye on Twitter I m sure that while many of these are people who were in fact cheating the sheer numbers say to me that SOME of these people like me must surely have been innocentStill the developers refuse to believe their bans can be mistaken so I m missing the money I paid for this game and I have a nasty  1 ban on record  blemish on my account It s probably there forever and the only people who can do anything about it vehemently refuse to do anything about itSo yeah I m assuming that you don t want to be locked out of a game you paid for with no evidence or support so for that reason I can t recommend this game,negative

Loving thie game great shooter i d reccomend having a decent graphics card for the best reults but even on my ancient pc setup the game runs fineMy only gripe would be they serverely shortened the parachuting range which can be quite handy for survival in the first round of the gameyou can play for survival or you can play for hardcore combat which makes for andreanlin pumping moment squad mode can be hilarious if you have a group of buds to run with no wonder IGN calls it game of the year for 2017 it thoroughly deserves it,positive

This is my first review ever on steam and I quite the game after dying to a cheater about 1 min before starting this review First off i do love this game it has its bugs and server issues yes but when it works it is fun but until 10 I personally havent had this big of a problem with cheaters and bugs I have had multiple games in a row now with cheaters or get killed because of bugs in the game and I figured the issues I am having as far as the game wouldve happened in beta but no they are happening to me now cheaters will always be there though and as much as they annoy me these bugs and glitches are terrible As nice as it is to see an early access game go full release this game is nowhere near being considered more than a beta Please bluehole fix your game stop cheaters and show us you care about this product instead of using it as a cash grab,negative
Awesome but still at v10 full of bugs,positive
EDIT REVIEW   I reviewed this game some time back Disappointed with the expensive in game reward crates that took forever to afford with in game currency  BP Then when opened provided the most boring and bland cosmetics  plain white pants glasses black shirt etc Returning to the game recently due to a large amount of additions to the game such as  rewards weapon skins and more maps to play I was eager to give the game another shotWhat an effing waste of time I could care less that the improved rewards are still expensive with in game currency it would have been worthwhile to earn them nowBUT NO what ticks me off is the new micro transactions Play a dozens of matches so you can afford a crate  which starts out as 700BP and doubles price with every purchase FYI not to mention the other crate option starts out at 5000BP Go to open it to find a notification that you need a key to open the crate you just purchased with BP I wonder where you get the key  Ah of course you pay 250 for the key  which is used in the process so it is not a 1 time purchase additionally each crate uses a different key just to open the crate of rewards that you played hours to afford with BPThat completely defeats the purpose of earning your rewardsWhy  Because you earn the reward crate with BP just to be told you have to drop more of your hard earned money on this already mediocre unoriginal game to access your reward MICROTRANSACTIONS ruin any game in my not so humble opinionDear GreeneFrom my heart to yoursGO F  YOURSELFSincerelyThis disappointed and quite unfortunate customer,negative

Should have never left early access,negative
So I ve had this game since early April of 2017 and I thought I d write a short review on why I personally think it s the best battle royale game out there at the momentI haven t put a crazy amount of hours into it but I ve put enough in to get a good grasp of each update for this gameSo it started out as a gripping battle royale game that had serious potential while still being a game that is playable from the get go Despite what others may have said I believe each update has been a step in the right direction for the most part I ve seen and heard people in the past complaining about PlayerUnknown mentioning that cosmetics could become only available through cash but does that really matter even if they did  The chances are you ve got a decent amount of cosmetics in your inventory by now because it s not hard to get them at all The standard stuff isn t that bad anyway and you can pick up further cosmetics throughout the map if you wanted though I wouldn t recommend picking up that bright blue shirt because you felt like it  I have an i5 4460  32 GHz paired with a gtx 960 2GB 8GB RAM and an SSD that I have PUBG on  Due to the weird clay texture glitch sometimes After the latest Nvidia driver that focused on PUBG I have gained an average of about 20 30 more fps keeping me nicely above 60 fps 99 times out of 100 I play on mostly low and medium settings with some exceptions of very low I stuck my game on ultra the other day and was getting 35 55 fps throughout This was playable but I d just recommend lowering your settings   On a mix of very low low and low high textures and anti aliasing depending on what I feel like I receive about 70 90fps on both maps though the second map is a bit better for fpsIs it worth the 2699 price tag I would personally say without a doubt yesIt always has been from my point of view and probably always will be though you can never know what a game dev will ever do reallyI know I ve covered minimal points with this review but I felt like these were the most important and worth mentioning pointsI don t mind solo games at all and I think they are quite fun but if you and a couple of mates are wondering if you should  get this DO IT,positive
so  much fun,positive
THAT THE GAME WHAT I ESPECT HOW TO BEE ,positive
Owned this game since very first launch as early accessTo be honest I went from playing on very low to ultra as we speak right now on i5 6400 gtx 1060 w 6gb vram   8gb ramGame went through so much adjustments but the community are greedy for way more they adjust optimize and release new content and I ll be honest with you you dont see an everyday company that does those three in same time and rock at doing it This game is a total buy and has a really BRIGHT future infront of it,positive
How would I rate this game  In its current state I would honestly rub LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in my eyes before I would say this game is even remotely close to being a full release game When they announced its 10 release I laughed for a good 5 minutes because it is impossible to even get in a house before someone lags behind you and rapes your LOVE LOVE LOVE  If you like LOVE LOVE LOVE  rapage this is the game for you because you cant pick up a gun before you re ripped a new LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

Chinese players need their own servers or at least not have access to servers where their ping is actually more than 800 From a server side look at things it looks like the players are just laggy but people can easy peasy lag switch and the server cannot tell the difference Im not even complaining about the hackers which are also a problem but im talking about the laggy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s who come out of nowhere and blow your brains out You are in a house waiting out a fight outside doors closed and then all of a sudden you hear a bunch of sounds over each other and then you die The devs call you a racist for not wanting to play with them but I just want to play with people who have similar ping If an American had LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ass ping I would not want to play with them either Idiot dev10,negative

Pretty boring I like a lot more action in my shootersWaiting to get into a game waiting for the game to start waiting to parachute to the ground scavenging equipment forever moving town to town  then finally a 10 second gunfight that s over and then you have to re queue to do that all over again This game s 90  nothing happening I hear that time is tense for other people but I was just boooooooredThe combat isn t even that great once you finally get to it Network code is unoptimized animations are weak player movement is unrealistic and janky Lowering your graphic settings gives you a huge advantage by removing grassshrubs and making the enemies stand way out No cover system Mechanics that heavily favor campers and luck with a deadly blue forcefield that shrinks on a random point as the game progresses Don t forget plenty of hackersAnd yet insanely popular Not my kinda game Might play it more if some friends pick it up but otherwise no intentions of ever reinstalling,negative

It s quite disgraceful to see Greene said The Chinese player base is very passionate for Battlegrounds and they love our game They re the reason we have such a high number of concurrent users Yes there s some cheaters that come out of there but the majority of our Chinese players just love our game and love playing itThis kind of xenophobic attitude that a lot of Western players seem to have online is just disgraceful It s 2017 We live on one big planet together What the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I m quite ashamed of those players that shout these things out We want to create a great space for everyone to enjoy across the globe and locking one region out  I don t know what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  theyre thinkingUnless the creator changes his attitude with this PC LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t and realizes that there s a serious issue with having 800 ping Chinese region players running around killing you while you cannot do anything against it do NOT buy this game,negative
Finally the new patch came But I am very strongly dissapointed in this patch I was super hype about it because of new 4x and 8x But what happens is that it feels like movement is worse than before And also the fact that I can t choose wich map I want to play I guess this is a bug but still The new map looks cool and all But I don t really like it Until this is fixed I am downvoting this game Like I really like the game and all but this is not okay,negative

Was great until the last few updates I could play great intense fast paced games This was even in Hawaii where all servers have a bit of ping from my location and on medium graphics settings Now all of a sudden rubber banding and 15 FPS with little graphical quality added and this is on the lowest setting Serious memory leaks it would seem not worth the time even if you have a high end PC Best wait until they care about fixing the PC rather than push sales for the console versions,negative

Lags at start of the Match are ok now but you wont even make it into a match because you cant connect to the serversIt takes about 10 Minutes to get to the Main Menu and guess what after you finished one round the waiting game for the Main Menu starts anew,negative

Laggy buggy and not optimized,negative
Recent update made this game unplayeable As it wasn t hard enough to hit something the recoil now is so big it s impossible This is supposed to be a game you know not a simulator,negative
I can see why so many people dislike this game now then before but this game really is a good game  Everyday PUBG gets more than one million players and if that much people are playing the game then you should look more into this game if you are more on the negative side right now  I have had this game since late July of 2017 and I still really like this game  For the time I have had this game only 100 or so hours isn t that much but if you want to play a lot of matches in one day you ll see it is kind of hard to do that  unless if you have friends of course  But playing a couple matches a day will not get you bored of the game  like I am right now and you can still have fun playing it  There are some bugs some crashes and PUBG should of waited longer before releasing but if you want a game to play with your friends then try PUBGDon t listen to the overpriced junk just play this game if you think you would enjoy it810 Meows,positive

More like PlayerUnknown s HackerGroundsHonestly the cheating problem is jokingly bad at this point Almost every game ends with a hacker wiping out the last 20 players or few teamsI know that people are being very rude to the Chinese playerbase but I honestly can understand the frustration When roughly 70  of the games you play in any other server are filled with Chinese speaking players it creates a verbal barrier for the community NA servers and Oceania servers are prime examples of this Try playing squads with matchmaking and see how often you are teamed with a Chinese speaking personAnd the people who are stating that there has been an influx of Chinese hackers are not racist there just happens to be an influx of players who just happen to be Chinese and also happen to be hackers Not every Chinese player is going to be aimbotting or wallhacking but there is a very noticeable group of them who are That is not saying that other groups of people around the world aren t hacking I have met plenty of other language speaking hackers as wellI m not saying region locking the game is the way to go But I believe a temporary block could help give the team time to create a better anti cheat The death cam was a step in the right direction You just need to follow it up nowAlso there is also a bug that defaults people to play in the Asian servers despite clicking on any other please fix,negative
They added a new map and the new map is really bad and all you play is that map and u cant pick what map you want to play on that and sometimes your buliding dont load in and you die but over all the game is good,positive
This game is greatThe great thing about it is that each game tells a new story like many other battle royale games but this one has the added bonus of being really realistic Unfortunately with the release of 10 some negative aspects have appeared  rubber banding not being able to choose the map and a drop in framerate from time to time,positive
NORTH AMERICAN SERVERS ARE LITTERALLY INFESTED WITH CHINESE PLAYERS YOU RE LUCKY TO MEET AN ENGLISH PERSON IN A SQUAD GAME AND THE DEVELOPER IS SHAMING ENGLISH PEOPLE FOR BEING MEAN TO THE CHINESE CAUSE  WE ALL LIVE ON ONE PLANET  THEN WHY IN THE F  K ARE THEIR SEPERATE SERVERS IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU STUPID LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THAT IS THE OPIONION OF AN IDIOT AND F  K THE NON ENGLISH PLAYERS ON ENGLISH SERVERS BUT IM THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  FOR WANTING TO PLAY AS A TEAM ON A SERVER FOR MY CONTINENT IF YOU RE CHINESE AND DONT HAVE AN OPEN MIC WITH AN ENTIRE FAMILY SCREAMING IN YOUR HEADSET WHILE YOU ASK US IF WE SPEAK ENGLISH THEN THIS REVIEW ISNT DISSING YOU I DONT MIND PLAYING WITH PEOPLE WITH AN ACCENT OR PEOPLE WHO DONT EVEN HAVE A MIC BUT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY PROPERLY WITH SOMEONE OBNOXIOUSLY YELLING IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE THE ENTIRE TIME YOU RE IN A GAME EVERY SINGLE GAME AND ITS FRANKLY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE T,negative

The game itself is fun but considering how long it s been in  preview status  and now that it s releasedit s not ready   Problems have not been fixed that have been present for some time  Rubber banding Cheating Server Disconnects   If they got these things fixed  especially the cheating  I would wholly recommend this game but for nowI would recommend looking elsewhere,negative

Awful experience This game is a major rip off Completely unpolished Game runs poorly on any system frequent network issues  disconnects as well Game play leaves a lot to be desired You basically run around a huge map for 30 minutes  literally until somebody you don t see shoots you Then you have to disconnect and try again I attempted to get a refund steam wouldn t help I ve never been able to connect to the test server it s always maxed out This game should never have been sold it is not finished It is a waste of time and money Even if it were free it would get old after one day,negative

I like the new map weapons vehicles and such  However the game crashes all the time and there is constant glitches  I hardly get the previous map anymore     This update is a step in the right direction but it also came with the games being infested with cheaters  Until the bugs and cheaters are dealt with I refuse to put any more time into it,negative
For all of hte hours that I have put into this game the pros greatly outweigh the cons This game has been a blast to play in squads delivering intense firefights and emergenct gameplay Highly reccomend jumping in now especially after their 10 launch,positive
The ultimate life or death battle indeed I love this game because of its wide verity of weapons and its squad mode Getting to hop on a dence server of diverse people with your friends killing your enemies and being able to freely roam everywhere around the huge maps  As long as you don t mind dying are just a few of the things that make this game so enjoyable 1110 would recomend,positive

I have found this game to be fun and highly addicting lately  I m one of the few that has left Fortnite and came here even with its many flaws In this review I will address some of the good and bad things I ve seen in this game This is my 100  honest opinion of the game at its current pointMain Pros 1 I have never seen a cheater  not even once I play split between TPP and FPP and I have never seen anyone hacking in either of them When cheating is addressed and exaggerated by anyone who reviews this game they either are very unlucky to come across a hacker or they re lying just to lower ratings of the game2 The looting system is well done and I see it as one of the better systems out there Back in the H1Z1 days I found myself stumbling around the looting and finding that even when I d drag something DIRECTLY over the slot it wouldn t detect my actions In PUBG it is very negotiable with how you loot  opening the inventory or picking up and it is highly responsive to dragging itemsMain Cons 1 This goes directly to BlueHole  please start to give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about your community Do you not see that you re game still has and had potential   This whole lawsuit wouldn t be necessary at all if you just took a step up and won your community back The reason Fortnite is succeeding is because Epic is so good at listening to critisism or obtaining new ideas from their community it seems that the more you do to prevent other BR games  success the deeper a whole you re digginmg for yourself This is my biggest issue with the game it s representatives2 Hit detection is one of the biggest flaws with this game It is the sole reason  other than RNG that makes me rage the most Deadass I ve hit a pebble on Miramar and my entire LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing pickup truck flipped for around a minute resulting in me losing the game for no reason This is an easy problem with an easy solution  the problewm with this is IT ISN T BEING FIXED STILL If the devs come to their senses maybe when Sanhok releases they can fix some of the vehicleplayer hitboxes as wellConclusion This is a great game it always has been but BlueHole needs to straight up admit their wrong doings and pick their heads up off the floor This game isn t dead yet but it will be if the right moves aren t made for this game soon I beleive in it and I hope BlueHole can make the right descisions toward saving it,positive
Decided to re install the game after a long break In a lobby with a friend Come to find out whoever readies up first the other person can t ready up after Just says  Preparing  then nothing no check mark Tried restarting both of our clients and trying either one of us as the host Still nothing Can t play with my friendTHIS is the bug you let go through  Can not recommend this game Focuses too heavily on content releasing and not on bugs being fixed or optimization of their game,negative
Too buggy too many cheaters 2 maps  I feel they dont do anything to improve the gaming expereance if all else fails they ll suestop wasting time and money on bullcrap and make the game better fortnite is gonna bury you,negative
this is simultaneously the best and worst game on the market right now,positive
Even months after full release the game is rampant with hackers it is unoptimised and there s bug after glitch The only reason myself and others have played for so long is because of the addictive nature of the BR game typeAvoid this game at all costs spend your time doing something more enjoyable like punch yourself repeatedly in tender spots,negative
This game is complete trash and hasd made me lose faith steam I ve never returned a game before and now I ll never buy another product through this platform They wouldn t let me return it even though it s unplayable I was within my 14 days and the time I spent  playing  was just trying to get it to run My PC is more than beefy enough And the little time it did run the game is full of hacks and cheaters 100  cheated Steam is straight up stealing money from people selling this rip off product Avoid this game and avoid steam F k You,negative
Rubber bands so bad atm almost unplayable,negative
They Ruined my favorite game Desert map is terrible Game looks fuzzy and has weird shadows 10 is garbage The game has been going downhill ever since the patch that added the Groza Vehicles are death traps slide all over the terrain and blow up randomly Everything that has been implemented into this game reduces the skillful aspect of the game Crouch jumping was something a player had to master to take advantage of now you can just vault  and randomly die at times to a vaulting glitch Bullet drag makes it impossible to hit shots at 300m consistently especially on moving targets The desert map is way too big in cities there are thousands of angles you can get shot from and the mid game on the desert map is a boring and involves running 1000 s of meters to get to the zone I have a lot of hours into this game and thoroughly enjoyed most of the early access I am an above average player who has 200 chicken dinners and know what I am doing  https pubgtrackercomprofilepcLucaEats regionagg After this 10 update I will not be playing this game any longer unless changes are made Uninstalled,negative

this game and its crashes are really annoying when it comes to a point of loosing a game because of a stupid crash that happends multiple times,negative
This game is similar the concept of Hunger Games and requires strategy skill and luck in order to win It was hard to get a hang of it at first but as you get used to it it will become more enjoyable Of course that would mean you might die many many time without noticing where you enemy is and be fraustrated However if you are not good at fighting what you could to is bascially hide and seek You hide for enemy and seek for safe routes to survive That way will be easier for you to survival to later game Also preferr playing this game with an headset because footstep and other nosie in this game are well design so that you can differentiate where it s coming from,positive
Bad servers,negative

Very good  3,positive
Was pretty good when it was in early access but since 10 the game is constantly rubber banding the AR drops are just ridiculous and the new map is just the definition of aids   ,negative
Release is a failure without map selectionAlthough Bluehole might suggest map selection is not in the full release as a design choice  as if 2 different maps are like different weathers it s actually due to the technical challenge of doing so By having not resolved it for its final and rather overdue release it s shown to all new players as well as old just how little they were able to move past the limitations of independent development despite the success of the game,negative
Please add map sellection,positive
Always desets map i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hate this map dude There are  less gear in the map I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hate it,negative

Version 10  Jumped from 30 fps on very low to low settings to 60 fps on medium to high settings On a budget Nvidia Kepler and AMD FX machine  Sharper cleaner looking textures at comparble settings  Texture streaming went from waiting a few minutes for textures to load to nearly seemless  Server still have issues but are less common than previously experience  Noticable cosmetic changes to more portioned weapon vechiles and set pieces  Death cam is a nice addition,positive

Can we have an anti cheat that actually works   What is it with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  companies releasing  early  stage games without proper moderation of player activity  If you want our positive feedback don t create terrible experiences The game on a whole I was expecting a sort of weapon crafting last man standing survival situation I imagined sitting in a tower my ramshackhomemade sniper rifle on my hands The sweat of nerves and adrenaline flowing  peering through the scope as i watch for  survivors  on the field Thats  not PUBG You drop in and can only pick from pre distributed weapons on the map which appear to always be in the same places on the ground Hackers know exactly where they are and will land faster then you grab the weapon and headshot you  before you even know whats happening I have personally watched my Deathcam replay to see people jerking back and forth like they re cycling through targets on an MMO through walls knowing exactly where you re hiding  There is no crafting system no customization of your player Most people look alike or are naked The reward chests are always the same rewards as your friend  no random loot at all so don t expect to look unique compared to your partners I m not a fan of the  restricting  playzones that constantly shrink to corral players closer to each other I feel it should only do that if the map detects there is no one near you or the match time is approaching max It shouldn t constantly be a race to the center of the circle as the circle will kill you more then the players will I would have preferred no area restriction unless you re alone within a mile to create long lasting survival situations You die so fast because of someone knowing where everything is That you really don t get to enjoy the environment and the rush I ve started a match and died within seconds only to jump into another match for the same outcome When i don t die instantly i die to the ring closure Why let us choose where to airdrop in if you re just going to force us to herd into a small area I feel this defeats the concept of such large maps  which this game definately has They are massive You can t outrun the circle it always moves faster then you Verdict  It needs a lot of work polish customization details and reward improvements to make us want to continue Match types for longer times or no map restriction options Randomized weapon placement,negative

Garbage game optimization and its difference BUG and its many game hanging moreBUG,negative
Okay first of all dont listen to any of the negative comments These people are ignorant and do not understand the costs and time involved in game development yet they complain about every single thing that happens While the game is not polished and still has work to be done these developers are extremely cooperative and understanding fixing problems and responding to the player s wishes First we asked for vaulting they gave us vaulting then we asked for new guns they supplied us with awesome and creative guns then we asked for a new map and more stability on the test client they responded quickly and with excellent results Many people have now begun complaining about the influx of hackers joining the Australia and Oceania servers but i can assure you that the devs WILL provide answers and a solution as soon as possible So please dont let anything deter you from buying this game its simply awesome and if you re a fan of GTA Battlefield Arma Dayz or Battle Royale style play then this is the perfect game for you,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game,negative
Please PLEASE PLEEEEEZE buy this amazing game It just got out of early access and the Devs have been working SO HARD on this game you would think that a Battle Royale game would be just like the rest but this one adds compelling gameplay and has some serously nerve racking monents a thing that ALOT of Battle Royale games can never make me feel It deserves better reviews with a constant of more than 1000 players on each day I love this game  ,positive

I have never really gotten into competitive shooters before this game but for some reason the gameplay of PUBG grabbed me I think it has to do with the fact that you can approach the game any way you like  Go in guns blazing hide in some unpopulated spot or just have fun trying to run people over in cars The game isn t super easy to learn but you will notice yourself getting better over time,positive
Get rid of these hackers and fix your f  king servers biggest pc game out right now and doesn t even work,negative
gameplay wise is all good fun and challenging with a bit of rngtechnically this game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sucks rn rubberbanding after parachuting 16 tick some hackers here and there it should have stayed in early access for a while if you can overlook all of those buy it for sure if you can t it will be really frustrating at his current state technically i can t recommend it,negative

BAD UPDATENew mapnew gunbut the server is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE laggy and all kind of stuffpicking weapons like need more than 5 seconds nowit s longer than beforei prefer playing test server than the normal ones after the updatessuch a crap,negative
The beta version used to be pretty good   a lot of hackers and bugs but the game was addicting After the 10 patch everything changed   it s super laggy now and the tone in game is just weird and unconfortable If the developers don t reverse the patch I think they ll lose many clients,negative
Pathetic Every update killing the framerate and developer choices FORCING players to play ONLY new map  desert I enjoy PUBG many many weeks but after they dont give us any chance to play it like before I decide to not recommend this unplayable title Was good in early access but not anymore,negative
Lags and rubber banding making any fun from playing gone from the first second after landing till the 5th second when some guy shoots you out of thin air This game left EA in worse state than it was before which is boggling my mind 30 milion players paid for this game and they can t hire anyone experienced enough to the dev team to fix the major issues it s unacceptable how lazy the devloper is,negative
Honestly this game is great You cant expect alot from a developer who overnight had a game become one of the biggest in the worlds You have to also remember that this game is practically an indie game Also this game is always compared to Fortnite i i keep seeing people come onto steam making the claim that Fortnite is so much better and more optimized  which it is but you have to keep in mind that the game has had 6 years of development by a well known gaming giant that has the reasources that PUBG just doesnt have Anyway you can have  a different idea on the game but i enjoy it playing games with my friends and all and cant wait for the next map to come out PUBG has been very inclusive with the players on the development of the new map and so you cant say they are not trying to make this game better for the players,positive
This game is so far away from the 10 version i was expectingRubberbanding the first 10 minutes of the game like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE I can t even select the old map and atm i can only play the new map which is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE don t buy this f cking game,negative

Sheesh these Negative recommending this game is not good guys seriously I m in South Africa and this is the best update i have seen with my below minimum cpu requirement i3 220 cpu but gtx 970 and 200 240 KBps internet speed You guys got what you want so bad the graphics quality and a few other things but all you care about is the cheatershackers and decide to give negative reviews on a game that has so many players playing that the game went down a bit and devlopers had to fix it I think they are doing their best at trying to banstop all the cheatershackers They probably don t want to loose their reputation of the amount of playing etc if they do then the game won t be much talked about on the internet loosing people hearing reading about about and thinking or trying to buy the game  Advertismentnews achievements Okay we get about the cheaters part but really their are so many players out that it is hard to be able to banstop all the cheaters in the game so just live with it or play something else until there are less hackersOMG the new Updatethe 10 pc launch is better than i expected nice and smooth even on my i3 220 cpu with gtx 960dispite the cheating that people are talking about  get over it you got the most out of the 10 pc launch sheeshThnx you developers for this update and all your hard work i am loving the update and the game itselfMy Graphic qualit has up the anti even though i have a   i3 220 cpu which is below the minimum  texture  medium  rest  low  but with very little lag once every minute before 10 my graphic settings were all  Very Low I pay my respect to the developer for their hard work and this game and what they have  done so far I would pay them a lot of money just for this and their hard work,positive

I figured I d wait till full launch to reveiwhonestly PUBG is really one of the best and worst games ive ever played I certainly got my moneys worth so from a simple financial standpoint  It s worth the cash and then some Highly replayable and hilarious at timesits a great game The game at full release is still buggy AF though it s frankly depressing I figured with all the cash they got from the millions of copies sold would have afforded them a more thourough and careful dev team It crashed immidiatly for me after booting up the new 10then later my friend got swallowed by a wall and died somehow  It s like jesus guysshoulda just waited and smoothed things out Now i m just sad and disappointed Will PUBG ever really be fixed  Is that somehow part of what makes this game great  Who knows,positive

Game does NOT remember game settings so after every single game you have to reselect solo squad whichever youre playing and if it was first person or not eventhough you JUST played a game with the exact same group of people you have to go through that every goddamn time Pathetic One of the worst sounds ive experienced in a shooter game And im talking about the direction you get shot from to where people are moving its the worst ive seen a dude two houses away from you on the second floor sounds exactly the same as a guy on the same floor in your house Someone shooting at you DIRECTLY from infront of you can and often sounds like its coming from behind or side or quite literally from the sky its just that bad its the worst of the worst in any fps ive played the last 10 years Shooting is kind of precise so thats actually sort of well done good for you Kind of fun with friends absolute trash alone Better with beer Overall overpriced pile ofLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  410,negative

I mean it s okay most of the time However it can be quite pleasing when you are doing pretty good during a match Then the other times you ask why you support a game with the worst developers since Plants vs Zombies The game has an ridiculous amount of bugs and issues that exists and will continue to exist for long time This game is worth it but will slowly drive you insane because of the issues you WILL face in this game You can be fully decked out in gear where you can easily win the game with to reach the moist Winner Winner Chicken Dinner Then all of a sudden on your three seater bike you flip over a hill and barely land the bike right side up Then you die in a minor fiery explosion and cry on the inside Then you play another round completely unsatisfied that you lost such easy game or go play an actually decent game like Iron Snout godbless,positive
Spawned into the pre game lobby ears were slaughtered by the sounds of pubescent children screaming and running in circles dropped out of massive paper mache looking plane opened parachute and landed in a school Over to my left a lone pistol with 5 shots lay on the ground to my right screaming child sprinting towards pistol verbally abusing anyone in its path I pick up the pistol and aim Sounds of immaturity increased as i had to take a second to remove my headphones as i was punched in the face and knocked out cold Game over 1210 would play again,positive

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a very promising game with very enjoyable gameplay and mechanics Recent updates have proved that they have the funding to improve the game and also have the audience to do so However the game must be optimised to work fluently for the game to actually to function at the level that the fanbase wants it to rather than add maps when the game is not fully ready to even consider adding more content such as new weapons and new maps I feel as if this game is only big due to it being the first game in its genre to make it big and this is how they have been able to stay as popular as they are I have played many other games like this such as Fortnite  Battle Royale and the IOS and PC version of Rules of Survival and have found that these games are more optimised even though they do not have the same amount of funding that PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS have So overall if the game has improved its optimisation and server issues then the game would actually be ready for a full release This game is mainly  a cash grab rather than a game for the players,positive

The game is great to play with friends and it s been nice seeing the game grow throughout it s alpha   beta phases It s a bit frustrating that the game only has 2 maps considering its nearly 30 quid but i feel i ve gotten my money s worth One day i would like to see the devs add a few more modes maybe a team death match capture the flag or even a battle royale in the same vein as H1Z1 or potentially Fortnite  if that s even possible considering the limitations at hand Only an idea though not expecting it to happen anytime soon given how lazy the devs are when it comes to adding new content And responding to feedback And actually developing the game And fixing the servers And making the game look like it didn t come out the rear end of my hamster So yeah Overall great game good community and hardworking devs,positive

Overall   Really fun game that is very competitive and hilarious if played with friendsEach game feels really different from the previous one since there are so many possibilities30 euros might be a bit expensive for some but lets just hope it gets cheaper after a while since its out of early access nowPros  Wide variety of guns  attachments and 2 amazing maps Really good graphics Feels very realistic  not just environment but guns and other features too Each game feels really unique and makes you want to queue for the next one immediately The experience just becomes 10 times better with each friend you add to your team Feels very competitive Really good gameplayCons  Might be difficult for some pc s to run Few people might have connection problems Game  as all others  has a few bugs that will probably remain as they are The game devs have banned over 300k hackers  i personally havent run into any just beware,positive

This game is the funnest deathmatch of all games i have played,positive
I love paying for a game I cannot play Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing servers Even buggier than early access avoid until fixed as the game is essentially unplayable at most times EDIT  While rubber banding has been fixed make no mistake this is still not a functional even playable game  Most games begin and end with the player still staring at the logo Also in the games that you can actually play you will find yourself getting killed by becoming stuck in the terrain EDIT 2  I am now enjoying getting killed by Chinese hackers almost every other game It s sad that I paid money for this and still can t recommend this 10 game Also you can be shot behind cover because the netcoding is somehow even worse than BF4 on release DO NOT BUY EDIT 3  Not enough time to loot now safe zone times are way too short If I want Fortnite I ll play Fortnite,negative

Playerunknown s battlegrounds is a game where you re set in a world that is ever shrinking whilst fighting for your life and moving towards the centerGenre wise it s a genius concept and it s definitely a major leap in entertainment and video gamesExecution wise it s not a GREAT solution but it works The choice of a complex engine such as Unreal was a good choice for the theme of the game howerver I have a feeling that it s been used wrong or otherwise unefficientlyThe gameplay experience is mixed as bugs are frequent and enfuriatingI have to stress at the end of this review it s not a bad game at all The game works as intended and it s genuinely a game that you want to play again and again That being said it s not a perfect game for everyone Personally I can t stand more than a couple rounds before having to do something else but it s extremely subject based Bugs are present and noticable,positive

This game is amazing it has its flaws but the team behind it are always working on themGreat to play alone if you want to concentrate and win and super fun to play with your friends in duo or squadsWould recommend it910,positive
This game is an absolute travesty in terms of optimization for the amount of time it has been in alpha Especially considering the fact that this game has had so much support from seemingly everyone on steam the end product seems like a spit in the face It s the perfect example of a game gaining too much traction before the devs could even finish it early access at its worst The people who bought this game  including me are the reason this game is the way it is we can sit here and complain about Bluehole all we want but the financial incentive isn t there for them As for the game it s a laggy repetitive and overhyped LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  show that only got this far because it s a battle royale game with shiny graphics nothing more I have learned my lesson when it comes to buying early access games never again never again,negative
Im having a problem joining a server i wondering if anybody else is having problems as well,positive
I highly recommend it Nothing will get your heart pumping more than a firefight in this game And if you have friends that play it it s a must have Playing in a squad makes it worthwhile but trying to go into a squad solo don t expect anything from it The main issue this game has is a HUGE influx of asian players that are taking advantage of the ping difference Game needs to be region locked BADLY No offense but if I want to go into a squad match solo I should be placed with people who speak the same language as me,positive

Good intense and fun but it requires a lot of optimising becuase i get 60 frames on withcer 3 at 1366x768 with mediumBut I don t get above 30 fps for pubg in very low settings at 720p This game needs to be optimised now or i need to get a new laptop but good laptops that can run pubg at 60fps with high at 1080p in india always require atleast 3 kidneys,positive
fun but not fun for my computer,positive
PUBG is far from a finished game It never runs consistently  There are so many glaring issues like rubberbanding at the start of a game and periodically throughout that are glossed over by developers and the people that play this game Nobody seems to acknowledge them or really push for a fix Instead of fixing these core game issues we get things like vaulting unnecessary ballistic effects and a new map After playing test server prior to v10 it is clear not much has changed Regardless of the enormous hype for the game out there do not buy this game,negative

this game is a joke,negative
yeah its pretty good,positive
 EDIT This game is becoming fantastic since they fixed the lag I can actually perform the way I should I love the direction they are going with this there are only 2 things that I think need fixing at this point  parachuting can be really glitchy at times ill get stuck on nothing or ill go flying somewhere and take damage for no reason The second is China I think they should be region locked I wouldnt even mind if everyone was region locked every few games or so I die by somebody that can see thru walls or can teleport anywhere and its annoying and they are always  asian not to mention it would be nice to be in a lobby with fellow english speaking people Other than those 2 points Great gameThis CAN be a great game but as of now it is not The lag alone is the reason I stopped playing if you get lucky enough to get a gun at the start of the game good luck trying to run over to it and pick it up as you rubber band and click f 10 times before you get it I have good internet I have 0 issues ever playing anything else But this game brings bad to another level I WISH they would fix this because I would love to play this daily but as of now I cant stand it,positive
This Is The Best Game Ever The problem is the developers don t focus on desync server issues and hackers And Now this is fully released it still rubber bands If they fix all that then this game is flawless it has everything and you can play all day and night,positive

This game is not a game to play It is a buggy mess and an idea that is mistreated by the developers Go ahead and don t update the pc version for a bit to make a very bad console port just for a cash grab Don t acknowledge the amount of cheaters on the game or the chinese players in lobbies they shouldn t be in Streamers are favored and can have anyone kicked for pretty much no reason Early access is a time to go out and enhance and make a game better not to waste everyone s time and do nothing for it This game shouldn t have even gotten an award for this year it s such a mess It s fun every now and again but not for too much Unless they fix their game now this will only get worse with time,negative

This game offers a fresh take on battle royale style games Each match is slightly different from the next and depending on where you choose to start the action can begin from the time you hit the ground to take out the players around you Of course you do have the option to parachute to a location that is away from the chaos and simply try to stay low and survive You ll want to loot quick and move across the map as the playable area becomes smaller and smallerAlthough I m not the best at the game it does offer a fun exciting gameplay that keeps me coming back,positive
if you aren t playing this game you aren t a pc gamer,positive
A very fun game with a certain level of randomness and variety that keeps the game from being stale The game is also fairly competitive in the FPP mode and offers a casual experience in TPP The only thing keeping the game from being very competitive is the most fun element   The random nature of the game Still v fun buy it unless ur poor,positive
Horrible performance and people snapping to your head from insane distances killing you before you can even react And don t forget people seeing a pixel of you in grass and somehow know you re there If cheating is your cup of tea by all means this game is for you Not like they re doing anything about it despite them claiming otherwiseEdit  24042018   Nothing has changed As long as lootboxes are in this game I see no reason as to why this would ever change Hooking currency on performance ingame that can be used to get buy and sell items for actual money Why wouldn t they cheat,negative
Past all of its flaws  which there is a handfull of the game is incredibly enjoyable especialy with a duo or squad of friends The game is thrilling and gameplay is something i personally find great tho it needs some work as mentioned No match is alike and even tho you loose a few games you still come crawling back craving for more The game is hard to grow tired of,positive

This game is fun and can be played for ages but constant crashes even though i have the recommended amount immovable cardboard boxes and small signs as well as the latest patch for  optimisiation  made my frame rate a lot worse as well as making it drop even lower a lot more frequently I think you should wait until better optimisation because it has really terrible optimisation it is not worth 40  Also think they should region lock the servers because I play oceania and can t even find that many people who speak english and it really limits queing with randoms410 wait for optimisationwhen optimisation is done well I ll rate it at least a 710,positive

I actually got salty and game a negetive review after the game crashed on the first round I played after the 10 release But then I proceeded to play the game for straight 9 hours during that same session The game is amazing now specially in NA servers the rubber banding is very low Not gonna say its fully fixed but you can defenitely play the game with the small bugs and problems I ve bought the game for 10 for regional advantages but I would have bought it for 30 if I had to Worth every penny in my opinion,positive

You spend 60 seconds in a pointless waiting area Then you wait for the plane to fly over the map and you choose a place to drop Then you parachute out  THEN the gameplay starts and you have to find a weapon if you don t die in the first ten seconds its because you are alone and you have to walkdrive across the map or you will automatically die If you die there is no respawn and you have to do all the BS over again This game is tedious and boring,negative

Just read the update from the Devs  Weve also implemented various automatic and manual anti cheat measures and thanks to all these actions have seen an estimated reduction of 657  in the number of players trying to use cheats  And here I am playing my fifth game witnessing how i got killed from a death cam by China men who definitely are sore losers using an aimbot and recoiless shooting You couldve at least make more effort to filter out these trash making it playable like CSGO,negative

UBG The game which everyone plays because its popularYou start the game get armed to the teeth full of weapons and armourMeet someone you die because of some BSRinse and repeat basicallyThe most fun you can have in this game is intentionally going to the popular areas in hope that youll get a shotgun  overpowerered compared to everything else then just rush someone whos landed near you and hope for the bestIts way quicker to get points like that than to play the game properly cause its just a waste of time with most of it being you walking across the barren map as well as the wait times for the inevitable death and restart that youll be doing alot,negative

First non early accces review ,positive
PUBG is an uninteresting waste of time The fun part of the game aka the shooty shooty part is so few and far apart You can either start aggressively and land in a high loot area like the various cities to get some gun fights but this will normally result in a loss because even if you do kill every person in the time it took you will be to far from the circle to survive The shooty part also comes at the end but it is mostly sniping behind trees Between the start and finish of a game you have a 15 20 minute period of just running and finding the same LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you already have with a gun fight once in a blue moon On top of very very boring gameplay the game runs like hot LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and even on high settings it still looks ugly,negative
For those who blame the poor optimization u should realise that this game has a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  HUGE map with a lot of lets say STUFF to render it s a big deal I as well had that problem and just sucked it up and brought a 1060 6gb and OH WELL 1080p 80FPS constantlyGameplay very cool but in my opinion u should work a bit on the Shotgun damage  i had level 3 helmet level 2 armour full HP and bam 1 shoted,positive
One word LAAAAAAAAAAAA A AAaaA aaag,negative
People reviewing the game are complaining about the lag and server optimisation  they so obviously haven t been playing on the test server  The 10 patch has removed all of the problems regarding rubberbanding etc and I can now play the game with ALL settings set to high on my four year old PC  just try the release version and you will be blown away by this game  ,positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS GAME IT HAS SO BUG WE CANT PLAY FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK THIS GAMEDONT BUY,negative
Played this game quite often You will go many matches with almost no kills unless granted by luck Aiming your weapon in this game is awful Taking about 3x the time to ADS and then don t even get me started on the movement Yeah it s a fun game for those who like self punishment but for me I ll stick to rainbow six siege AKA  where your shots will actually land if you are on thier body,negative
Used to be really fun but then the devs started working on pointless things  Now the game is just bad i dont eant to play it anymore  sad,negative
over hyped over rated,negative
Hackers are a problem I tried to play a couple of games and was killed by hackers so many times There is no way to beat them I played 5 games and 4 out of 5 I was killed by hackers from 500 meters away shooting on full auto This game was fun before all of the constant hacking Just know If you buy this game no matter what server you play on hackers will kill you,negative
this game is no where near done and should not be releasing yet,negative

I just want to ask BIUE HOLE s game development team Are you modifying the game with your feet  After this update M16 was four times more resilient than SKS Three heads were gone I searched half a big E city to find a base for three heads If you modify the game do you have to do a game ahead of time to investigate the situation of the game You think the desert map is big and you want to speed up the game change the time and speed of the poison circle Then you get the scolded dog blood You ll change it This version you add the wild area Take the more rich buildings in the big city Do you think the game is fast or slow  M16 has been chipped I can t see it Talk about the three level head The three level is our group of ordinary players against the strongest stuff You think the game is going Will we only be beaten after we encounter plug ins  If you want to overcome your luck with technology can you fight the same equipment with your mother  She scolded the technology with your heart,negative

Great game where anything can happen Best played with friends who can laugh and joke in the early stages and got your back in the late stages Nothing beats the feeling of that hard fought Chicken Dinner but even if you never get one so long as you take someone down with you it s all worth it A game hundreds of hours spent having the time of my life,positive

This is one of the most fun game I have played ALL YEARI cant wait for it to come out TODAYIf you are thinking about buying this game DO IT It is 100  worth every pennyHope this helped,positive
For all those people with negative comments just compare H1Z1 to this and then you get your posotive comment,positive
You re telling me that you can remove guns in the warm up you can make the game 10 with out it being ready you can add more guns to airdrops and you can add cases but you cant LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing make the game playable on OC servers simply because every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game and I mean EVERY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game is 75  Chinese players with the majority being cheaters Region locking China is literally the only way to fix this unless you can stop worrying about making LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing money with the cases and fix your anti cheat  no region locking china is bad  I m pretty sure making the game playable for the rest of the world  players who dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ruin your game is a higher priority than making sure Chinese players don t get butthurt,positive

Ok the game is really really fun the best battle royale game ive ever played in fact But I cant play it most of the time because of the lack of optimization in this game I have a pretty decent PC a little above average and I know I should not be getting FPS like I do in this game Also to add on to all this I have had some instances where I can be shooting a player very clearly on target not even that far away and doing nothing to them at all and it can be really fristrating Dear developers please stop adding new things and focus on fixing your game,negative

It s a pretty good game but it s lot more fun with friends,positive
A very polarizing game in my opinion Here s what I like about itGunplay is easy to get into The guns are meant to be realistic so if you ve played shooters in general You should be fineMap is expansive and fun when you have friends to goof around withA great selection of weapons You can VaultWhat I don t like about itThe visuals are bland and made up of free assets Dear god fall and spring trees in the same map looks like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE The optimization isn t  Quite  there It s runs fine now but it still needs a long way to goIf you re playing solo The map feels too big  this part is my opinion you can think differently about itMatches feel stretched out most likely due to its large mapThe devsDespite having 10 hours in the game I feel like I have nothing to show for it rather than numbersWould I recommend this game  Yes Look if you like realism shooters go for it If you want an arcadey shooter go for Fortnite and H1Z1 With the upcoming 10 release I hope to see good things out of this game For now it s an average game,positive
bro this game is dope i play it with my buddys all the time and we allways have a blast it does lag and take a bit to load but u can fix that by turning down your graphics and on the test server u can play the new map and ya itll crash but the game is being worked on so just give it time to be done itll be an extremly good game and so ya it is worth buying and also freind me to play with me and my buddy and we will help u out,positive
This game is worth the hype I broke my own rule of never buying a pre release game but it has been worth it,positive
Despite all the issues regarding cheaters performance issues and the developers  lack of timely effort to address these problems since the game was released   I think it s a really fun game that will make you wanting to play more Every round the outcome will always be different which makes it such an addictive game Playing on a team  duosquad makes it a lot mroe fun and engaging and recommend playing with friends Playing with randoms however you bear the risk of teaming up with non english speakers  especially players within the AS region who just love spamming the mic with Mandarin in whatever PC cafe they are in Annoying as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  For those looking to purchase the game   please keep up to date with the latest reviews and see what fixes have already been implemented or lack thereof and make your decision then See you on the battlegroundsEdit  Came here to change my recommendation Too many cheaters I m not talking once in a while It s gotten to the point where at LEAST half of your games there will be a guarantee hacker This needs to be fixed immediately and very sad for the developers to have this problem for so long,negative

The best and hardest battle royale game on the market PUBG is hard because to get good you gotta practise by playing A LOT It won t help to play other games since they only distract you away from that sweet chicken dinner you got to get your hands on 710 Fun but annoying sometimesRecommended for people which like last man standing and battle royale type of games,positive
eh they worry about the stuff thats not important like cases and duck bills  really some weapon attachements are proven to do absolutely nothing and did you wanna play with your friends tonight  oh too bad you all log on to see theres a 9gb updatewhich seems to be everyupdate,negative
Stop making money and fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game,negative
The game is a lot of fun It does have some optimization isues and perhaps more bugs than it should But these other players complaining about hackers in every game they play are either lying or just assume anyone who kills them MUST be cheatingI have 159 hours in the game I play every weekend for 5 hours and dozens of matches I can t say for sure I have ever encountered a cheaterhacker I am pretty sure I have encountered a couple Maybe 2 3 tops the entire timeThe hackercheater issue is just not as bad as people are saying I would say no more than any other game I have played online,positive
My first review ever This game is revolutinary I honestly mean it If you ever played Tlou Factions and had to 1v10 a group of people this is the feeling your gonna get but 10x more Its all about skill mind games and being one step ahead of your opponent Yes there are a number of hackers you will come across thats really the only down side and bluehole needs to be on top of their game to stop this but other than that i give this game 9910 the 1 being hackers,positive

I would recommend this game because its fun and it takes skill to win and get killsThe only problem is that for my country Israelwhen I kill someone it delays the kill So if I headshot him he can still shoot me and then die after 1 second Thats why most of the time when I kill someone he gets my health to 20 Another example is when I grab a gun or anything else someone else is grabbing it first cause of the pingThe default for me is Asiaalthough israel is considered in Asia I get the best ping in Europe in every game but still in AsiaEurope and Oceania I get lags Please help me fix this but besides that the game is fun and challenging so if you think you are good enough play it and  you will get addicted Be careful not to break your computer if you rage because you died in a stupid way xDthe game is still early access it will still have a few bugsglitcheslags,positive
It really sucks how buggy and unoptimized this game is could have been fun but it s to late now,negative
After the official 10 release of the game after my first 10 matches I have decided to write a review for the game PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is a great battle royale game not perfect still some bugs but there is now little to no lag in the servers Great game to chill out with your friends and earn some nice steaming hot chicken dinners while sitting on a pile of bloody body parts of your fallen enemies,positive
Really enjoyable game could use fixes here and there but overall I have to recommend it,positive
The 10 update really address so many problems like more maps OPTIMIZATION and others Now I do recommend this game with a rate of 910,positive
yes get this game,positive
IT CAME OUT EARLIER THAN DAYZWHAT,positive
Not very fun Loot for 5 10 minutes then run I hope you like running because you do that ALOT Aside from marginally upgrading your items every few minutes there is nothing to do but run or hide The limited action you get is usually very short and not fun and comes in the form of getting shot from out of nowhere and then your round is overCongrats you just spent 10 15 minutes walking in a field and collecting loot that is totally meaningless now Don t buy this game If you are looking for something like it but more entertaining check out Fortnite It s free,negative
is good game Not run great though,positive

Far from perfect but this game can be a lot of fun despite the audio video network bugs and glitches The new desert map though is more of a camping running driving if you are lucky enough to find a vehicle simulator It s hard to say what PC Build 10 will be like since the Test Servers were very laggy and lots of crashes with the kill cam Definitely a massive in progress game but adding all the bugsglitches and hacks I am hesitant to recommend anyone spend their money on this if they were not involved in the early access,negative
this is a nice game,positive

GREAT GAME CRASHES EVERYNOW AND THEN BUT REGARDLESS GREAT GAME,positive
I quit PUBG There s rarely a chance to retaliate and beat an opponent who damages you first Stealthy players are favored too much What if I wanna be loud and counter a stealthy player  If you re at a choke point you ll lose to peeker s advantage unless your opponent sucks A completely concealed opponent WILL get the first shot on you and if you can heal you re probably gonna get rushed And don t tell me to  get good  because if a silent person on the other side of a hill hears you running they can kill you with ease and even if you check EvErY SiNgLe aNgLe you run the risk of getting rushed because you have to scan so many surroundings which slows you down and gives a roaming enemy time to come over the horizon of another hill Actually maybe I m wrong about that one But what I know for a goddamn fact is that you can t analyze your opponent in time usually which is key to win any game They ll kill you before you can think of a way to counter them and you ll never be able to make a comeback This game is NOT eSports material Multiple round games like Rainbow Six Siege allow you to analyze an opponent s playstyle over the course of multiple rounds and you have a chance still by thenAnd even if there is more to it than I realize I m too overwhelmed This is a very punishing game and it s so difficult to correct your mistakes,negative

 Yes the majority of cheaters come out of China but that doesn t mean all Chinese players are cheaters This idea that just because you ve got a few bad eggs you ve got to ban a whole country is a bit reactive    Brendan GreeneMr Greene are you pulling a Mark Zuckerberg so you can sell more units in China No one is saying ban all Chinese players from the game We re asking for a REGION LOCK because there is absolutely no reason for them to be on the NA server or any other server It s simply unfair that we have to play with people who have absurd ping severe latency and lag compensation as well as a higher tendency to cheat,negative
Very interesting game but you might not enjoy it sometimes as match making is not established by experienced or skill by players If you had purchased it and jumped in to play expect that you might be playing with a player that is above your level that can overplayed you So it means that you might not be able to even pick up a gun and instantly you died Very frustating in my experienced even changing the gun to fully automatic Yes  you need to press B to change it to either Burst or Fully Automatic but the default is Single shot so you might wonder why he has a better gun than yours,negative

I don t get how people don t like this game I get that there are the Fortnite fanboys that think PUBG copied Fortnite but this is a much better game Here s my reviewPrice  Good Wait for a sale if you don t feel like dishing out 30Graphics  Amazing  Play on Medium or High for best frames if you have a decent PC It s still beautiful on MediumCommunity  Okay The NA and EU servers are fine but the AS servers are filled with hackers Every server has a good amount of toxicityGameplay  Amazing Tactical strategic and sometimes rage inducing  ie being sniped by a nerd with a SCAR L with a flash hider so you have no idea where he isThis is only a multiplayer game except for the mobile version where you can play with bots and peopleMap size  Huge vehicles are a must have if you need to get to the safe zonePS This is way better if you play with friendsSo there you have it That s my review of PUBG the battle royale game that is BETTER than Fortnite,positive
Fun and challenging for both you and your PCNeed an SSD to play well,positive
You can even tell in the preview video that the gameplay is all floaty and awkward Imagine some inexperienced high school game developers made a Battle Royale game on Elder Scrolls IV  Oblivion s game engine and decided to add  vehicles that look like they re sliding on ice and that s this game,negative

PUBG is a great game overall and design is solid Some issues i have with the game is when lag hits parachuting 234kmh on to a rooftop the loot don t show up and can miss a crucial weapon Also there are times where you loot multiple houses and duplxes and don t find a single gun But i still enjoy the game and its worth purchasing,positive

one thing id like to say first why is the game full of racists   accoriding to this people chinese people shouldnt be aloud to play how dare they enter other servers sorry i live in china and there are plenty of austrilins and people from the usa in the asia servers so tell you what when you all f off out of the asia servers maybe we will lead by example  as for the game very fune when it works very annoying when it dont work as for the list of issues if you pay any attention to gaming media you allready know them so not much point in relisting them here and last but not least  CHINA NUMBER 1,positive

Its an amazing game if they can get the lagg out of the servers,positive
so  tonight is the official release of PUBG and i would like to say this game came a long way from where it started at first the game was really buggy and it was a early access  I saw potential in this game there was a lot of players and a fast growing community a lot of people  i guess you can say dropped out of playing this becuase it was buggy and thinking the game was a waste of money and the game wouldnt get any better but i look at it like this support the idea and the devs can grow their team pushing out updates that the community wants makes sense right  and now night of the release the game has changed little to no issues now with the game more guns drops rates for what the community wants as well as a new map and more to come i hope their team grows and that this game will last for years,positive
I like it it s not a game for everyone but with friends It s a gauranteed good time,positive
Great game Simple and easy concept and most of all there s not a difficult learning curve,positive
As some one who played the Day Z mod on Arma 2 and the Battleground and BR on Arma 3 I highly suggest this game It has its bugs and kinks but what dev company get everything right in early acces  Cheaters aren t as bad as everyone makes it out to be but they are there For the price tag you get your money s worth twice over even 1010 would be killed with a pan again,positive
my game is not working plz help me bluehole,positive
A really fun game with me dying a lot and have potato aim,positive
This game turned my console gamer friend into a PC gamerWe literally upgraded his pc so he could play this gameYESthe game is buggy You ll encounter glitches and fps drops Sometimes random stuff will happenBut thats because this game is still in Early Access what does that mean PUBG IS STILL IN BETAand for a game that is still in beta its real goodThe gameplay is good especially with friendsI tried the test servers and it looks a lot smoother and polished If that s how the game will end up once it comes out of BETA It ll be a damn good game More than what it already is,positive
This game is a mess I feel bad for both buying this for myself and for a friend of mine as a birthday gift Ever since the start it has been getting worse with patches and updates that so far haven t helped the game much or have made it worse over time During the beginning of its release it seemed to be a fun game because there was always a lot of action and it involved some fun teamplay I see how the concept of the game is fun and great even but the mechanics of this game don t work well along with it as do the servers because it can t handle the vast majority of players that play the game  Which they still haven t fixed to my knowledgeAlso worth mentioning is that these devs are not trustworthy as they have broken promises such as when they said microtransactions were not going to be part of the game and they included it anyways with loot boxes for cosmetics Sure it may not be a big deal for those who don t care about cosmetics but some people care about cosmetics as they like to look cool while playing the gameAll in all this game has bugs and glitches as well as bad server performance and consumes your CPU GPU and RAM if you don t meet its required hardware specifications Stay away from this game if you can and tell your friends the same buy a different game that is worth the money you are willing to spend,negative
Loot and run simulator And being headshotted out of nowhere1010   would run from circle again,positive
its Very Nicebought another ram for thisworth it,positive
Poor opitimization unstable server and ridiculous number of hackers presents,negative
steam wouldn t let me refund this game,negative
This is a very broken game that needs a lot of work The rubber banding at the beginning of the match is borderline unacceptable and definitely makes the game unplayable It often even makes you die before you even have a chance to loot because you pick and item up and it disappears from your inventory That being said I do not intend to stop playing the game anytime soon as long as they keep optimizing and improving the game When I first started playing I was lucky to get over 80 fps and now average 110 140 depending on the day The concept is great and this game is very enjoyable when playing with friends Bottom line is I paid 36 CAD for this game and have had 245 hours of mostly fun besides the odd game where the poor servers or optimization has costed me a match Where a game like COD WW2 that I spent 120 CAD on and only played 16 hours of the game and dont plan on playing ever again Do the math and PUBG was a great investment where COD was a poor one,positive

This game COULD have been great As it stands gameplay is fun but bugs  and lack of resource usage optimisation mean it still feels like a beta Glitchescrashes are an every game experience and hackers are almost as common Single player is a boring camp fest for  30mins Nothing to work toward except winning against hackers and glitches Every update is several gigabytes of aesthetic LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t rather then FIXING THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME   just dont suggest this on the forums  not matter how polite its bannable,negative

With version 10 releasing in a few hours I thought i would share my reviewI have over 150 hours in this game so i can leave an honest reviewI bought it on a whim after reading a few positive reviews  I mean jumping out of an airplane with just your underwear on scavenging for weapons and fighting for your life sounds like a blastAll the negative reviews are mostly about game optimization in game purchasesadscheaters etc I haven t seen cheaters for like a month so they are working on things the game is running smoother then ever  yes it still needs improvement and for in game purchases it s just silly cosmetic items given the price point of the game im OK with that  Just remember every time you purchase DLC a loot box skin etc YOU ARE RUINING THE GAME INDUSTRY  look at the mobile game industry  I ve gone the whole year just playing indie games and honestly after seeing the newest Call of Duty I m glad for it the triple  A  studio s just keep re skinning the same old crap and selling you half a game for 7999 CAD and expect you to pay extra for the whole thingThis game is very different from the run of the mill FPS game   Every kill is meaningful and every death  almost physically hurts I give it a solid 2 thumbs up it ll probably win several game of the year awards and you should get on board enough writing I m getting hungry for a chicken dinner,positive
aye fam this game lit people think their are hackers but really they are mad cause bad xd 1010 wud buy again,positive

 Best muliplayer game of 2017 ,positive
Instead of finishing a buggy unnoptomized game they instead focus their attention on the money and port it to console The console version is horrendous and I can t even believe Microsoft would allow an unfinished game to be released on their platform but this is about the PC versionFor the gameplay it really came down to luck whether or not I had any fun I will admit the game can be very fun and exhilarating but its not very often After about 15 hours and a good win rate the game just felt more like a chore to play when friends asked You either land on a place on the map where the circles will keep moving towards which allows you to gear up and in my experience have more fun or you unfortunately land on the complete opposite side of where they move towards and spend the entire game trying to beat the wall while trying not to die while having no time to loot In most cases you end up spending the whole game running from the wall only to die after doing essentially nothing but running Playing with friends is the way to go in my opinion but even then it can be a bit tedious There seems to be someone that always dies early on and they either have to wait the entire game   40mins spectating which sucks or have the whole squad quit find a new match and try again to survive the beginning of the game For me I would say about half my gameplay time was spend in and out of lobbies and running away from the wall which was quite boring The only fun part of the game to me is late game when the circles get smaller and smaller Thats when the adrenaline starts pumpingAs for the games performance it is notoriously unoptomized I have a relatively high end rig but I have to run on low normal settings to get acceptable performance There were also quite a lot of bugs when I played that ruined a handful of matches but I would like to imagine they have been fixed since I last playedEven when all the bugs are fixed and they game is optomized I still wouldn t be interested in playing again To me the fun ran out early on and every match feels the same regardless of the outcome Of course this is just my opinion on the game Your experience may vary If you can get the game on sale for 50  off I would recommend it But that will probably never happen as its never gone on sale Maybe in the year 2020,negative
This game can be fun but unfortunately it is still being plauged by many bugs and issues such as de sync hit reg etc I personally feel like with the amount of money they have made they could have a game twice as good by now Not recommended atleast until it actually feels like a quality product,negative
Lag lag lag lag lag This game is trash Wait I have 600 hours on it already  This game is great,positive
THIS IS DEFFINATELY THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR GARRENTIED VERY ADDICTING AS WELL AS A HUGE MAP ALONG WITH OTHERS ALONG THE WAY THIS IS A GREAT GAME WITH MUCH TO STRATIGIZE AND DEFEAT OTHER PLAYERS WITH INTENSE FIREFIGHTS I DEFFINATLY RECOMEND THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH IT IS IN EARLY ACCESS BUT IT IS SO CLOSE TO BE RELEASED,positive
This is one of those times I wish Steam has a nutral button I would like to start by saying this game is great however I got board playing alone once I got my first win note I said alone PUBG is only fun when you play with friends I have put countless hours into PUBG with a squad of my friends for those looking to see if they should buy this game get it if you have friends who will play it with you If you don t well buy it unless you have either an extreem competative drive or you just really want to try it as for the bad reviews from people who have 10 20 hours don t trust them  do what you want they are the people who hit the huge learning curve and stopped Half this game is luck and map knowledge the other half is skill for the people who decide to get the game after scrolling through the reviews to stumble apon this i will give you a few tips I wish I had learned earlier Tips for new players 1 don t drop in unpopulated places it helps you develop much needed PVP skills other wise it can get old quickly loot die repeat2 be aware of your sorroundings  theres a little key calld Alt if you hold it down you can free look all to offen I see people who don t see me directly behind them just because they don t utalize the key3 Do not camp a house all game it will leave you significantly underlooted for the end game and in my opinion this game already has way too many people like this you will find people laying in the grass waiting for someone to pass  I call them snakes It s frustrating to die to someone you can bairly see doing this,positive

The game is bestbut full of HACKER,negative
Before you purchase this game understand that clicking  Play  in PUBG does not mean you will get to play PUBGThe game started out stable fun a great game The biggest complaint I had was some fences and walls were difficult to jump over SInce then instability has continued to hack off limbs from the game Crashes are to be expected at most every other game Expect games to rubberband and lag for at least the first five minutes of every match Don t expect it to get better after the first five minutes but get excited because it  MIGHT  get more stable This game started out as a full bodied great game with fixes incoming for the handle of frustrations To me it has now become the epitome of an Early Access Nightmare Errors crashes and instabilities everywhere with no reliable fixes in sightThis game is incredibly fun to play it s a great game   But right now I have a hard time saying that purchasing this game equals playing it I hope the official release and departure from Early Access will bring this game back to not being an Early Access experience,positive
IT GUD,positive
Loved it on release love it now,positive
having played 68 hours of this game i loved every second and if you have a group of friends on pc to play this with its a must,positive
PUBG is probably the most mediocre game this year Try to look for  action packed adventure   according to Game Informer while all you ll get is a time wasting boring unoptimized game,negative
We re still facing the same issues that were in the game on day 1 on early access the xbox got it even worse pray for our xbox breathren we re in this together,negative
HEYYYYYY IT S PRETTY GOOD,positive
The game is good and fun but even with a good PC the game won t run as you d wish Probably it s a problem with its engine because it has been updated but even so it continues bad optimized Another thing I can think of is the number of players 95 players in a map will cause a bad frame rate Well if you got some money to spend it s worth otherwise it ain t,positive
Totally not worth getting it at the full priceI hope with v10 I will change my mind________Update  The game was drastically improved over the state it was in when I played it for the first time It is now definitely much more enjoyable and fun to play,positive
Good game except for some bugs and glitches and little lag but overall great game for early access,positive

Since most people either turn to PUBG or Fortnite if you want better gunplay more skill slower gameplay and the use of different tactics go with PUBG If you want an arcadey casual and fast paced Battle Royale go with FortnitePros Huge selection of guns cars attatchments boosts and cosmetics that you don t have to pay forHas both 1st and 3rd Person ModesTwo maps about to come out with anotherBoth maps have multiple towns various cover points detail oriented settingsVicinity Chat is always a plusGreat gunplay not quite at DOOM or Wolfenstein level but getting there Each shot has punch unlike COD or CSGOGreat to play with friends and work together as a teamConstant updates and the devs work with the communityCons Gameplay is rather slow esp on the desert map No selection option for map preferenceOften times glitchy1st Person isn t as perfected as 3rd PersonNot optimized as well as FortniteGraphically demandingTL DR  Very fun game that is still being worked on Despite some cons the tactics grittiness and variety that this game provides has elements that some may prefer to Fortnite Just think of it like ARMA to Battlefield,positive
Excellente game PUBG is a game that as many other uses the  Battle Royal  style the main and only difference is that it executes yet almost perfectly  it has a lot of success because its an awesome genre but with just a few good gamesI dont think its needed to describe the gameplay because everyone already knows it but what I can say is that its very enjoyable The only issues are the fact that its a new game  today it comes out of early access but the majority of its issues will be corrected today and the rest of the issues are 100  tolerable,positive
do some thing about low spec gamers,positive
Love it Loved it since the DayZ mod of it loved it when it entered Arma 3 loved in H1Z1 and still lovin  it to this day,positive
The game is a good multiplayer game mode but that seems to be all that is all its going to be Playing the game to get the chicken dinner is fun for the 1st few matches but theres not much towards afterwards Even though its coming out of early access it still has bugs lags alot crashes and unoptimized very bad for mid level computers Its competition namely Fortnite has a better mechanics less bugs more cosmetic rewards and its free,negative
They will never optimize this game close range fight is terrible netcode is a joke physics is riddiculous Shame on your developers,negative
This game both fun and frustrating will have you wanting more while also complaining about the problems Overall a blast to play with friends,positive
OMG so good GAME ,positive
After 400 hours of bugs and performance issues I decided I m finally done with this gameThe potential PUBG has is HUGE but thee developers prefer to patch microtransactions and skins into the game instead of real issues which are there since release,negative
Good game,positive

I rarely write a review but I am doing this in hope that the developers will heed some of the negativity  I seriously doubt it but here it goesPUBG is really fun  I do enjoy playing it but it has gotten more buggy and less optimized with each update  Other games I play I am able to get wll over 100 fps with little issues  Games from Seige to COD etc  However I struggle to get 30fps with PUBG  It is game breaking  This is my number one complaint withh hackers being a close second  Its hard to tell when someone is lacking or its just lagframe rate issues,negative
Me and this Game have something in common  Neither of us are very good,negative
Buggy un finished and rage inducing but a whole lot of fun Especially if you re playing it with friends,positive

1   Dullest battle royale game in the market only two things hold this game up the battle royale concept and being able to play with friends which are bare minimum for the genre2   99  of the time you run and hide and that is the only factor that makes the shooting part exciting because it makes the rest 1  of the time you spend in dull shooting feel like heaven after all the waiting and sprinting Even jumping in a crowded area people will hide like cockroaches and try to listen your footsteps3   Absolute garbage optimisation and low performance for dirt ugly graphics  edit 35   Originality and creativity is NON EXISTANT in PUBG It s just 100 people play hide and seek in a desolate 2000 era graphics map where nothing happens 0 events 0 quests4   Shooting is plain and simple Calling it realistic would be the best compliment but its not realistic Its not balanced either5   Weapon balance is awful Its clear as day developers cannot decide if they want to implement a realistic damage and bullet physics or fun damage and bullet physics 6   Camping like a rotten corpse wins you the game while running around and fighting is fun but you get killed easier7   Laggy foreign players who will shoot you through corners because the game favors the shooter no matter the lag8   Great example of how indie developers can succumb to greed and create lootbox system on a 30 a pop gameVerdict 1 out of 10 for battle royale games Other are as follows 010 H1Z1110 PUBG410 Radical Heights yes even this game is better than PUBG610 Fortnite BR the best piece of turd in the pile of garbage that is called battle royale genre,negative

Pros Is challenging yet rewardingAt times scary  but in a good way if youre like me and not good at the gameJumping out of a plane into a map that you have learnt like the back of your hand is really cool and funAt times funny  with friendsAnd most importantly funCons The blue zone is annoying but necessary to make the game fun so it gets a passIts ugly with copy paste texturesIt needs more work on important things not new mapsweaponsvehiclesAnd the CPU optimisation is horrible    This one is a big problemIn conclusion the game is great But it needs more work on optimisation and not on more things,positive
a very good gamei like itAnd i feel very happy ,positive
it is a rlly good game it is worth buying  ,positive
I played my first match and i thought i did good When i started i decided to go into a METAL GEEEEAARRR mindset crawl the whole way basically i wormed my way up to number 5 then i died after tacticaly applying buckshot rounds to a few unlucky souls i got my 700 coins and got my first drop shoes i killed people and died for shoes Well its better than kids annoying me for Hats,positive
Overall rating  7010 at this time despite any negative criticism I would recommend this game as long as you feel the positives outweigh the negatives and keep in mind this is still alpha though this will be changing soon and I m not sure if all the issues will be fixed by the time it releases which is why I wrote this review I hope this helps in your buying decision Note  I only have 12 hours of game play due to a 2 year old gaming laptop not being able to handle low settings causing graphic lag low detail etc  I was doing traveling work and also playing on the test server I was basically a mulemedic in my squad Since relocating back to where my desktop was located and having a GTX1070  16GB RAM  Phenom 2  34 Ghz etc I am able to play on medium   high settings with none of these issues Please note if you would like to enjoy this game you should have a pretty decent and modern build Pros Great team based game  can solo but definitely more fun in a squadForces players to continue movinglooting  circle gets smaller and smaller   mitigates long term snipe camping Graphics are actually pretty decent if your PC can handle max graphics However most can only run low medium without sacrificing frames diversity in weapons and vehicles  I would like to see this expanded on further There is a degree of luck that plays into this game whether it is finding the right gear or dropping in the right location which is a nice variation to standard shooter games Cons  Optimization needs work need a really modern video card to be somewhat competitive  lower graphics lower ability to see enemies Rubberbanding major issue especially at the start of any game where finding a weapon is important for immediate survival  Random crashes not often but does occur to almost everyone at one point or another  Cannot heal in vehicles while they are moving which seems counter intuitive  I can understand why you can t gas a vehicle up while moving However no reason you can t drinkuse pain medsheal in vehicle  There is only one map  second on test server I would like to see more,positive

Had The potential to be amazing then The hackers came and ruined it Watching this video here to promote the game makes it look great unfortunately you can unleash hell on a guy with an M16  M4  Ak barely scratch them before the spin jump 1 shot kill you with a double barrell shotgun or a revolver     these 2 guns are deadly up to atleast 500m For Sniper Rifles LMG s you need to wait for the death crate to be dropped from the plane unless you re directly under when it lands there is no point going near it as it s like Flies around LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Lots of Known bugs updates every 2nd day that fix nothing or things that are hardly noticed I d wait for the game to come down in price before buying it if i had known that it was going to go from great to mediocre so fast i would have waited and bought it on the sale ,negative

 Be me Wake up in a strange island Hear people screaming  China Number One  Completely disagree Attempts to educate them on how the US remains the worlds largest economic power by a substantial marginWhile the number one title is certainly vague and could mean anything i will be assuming that the number one title in this scenario relates to the economy showing 3 evidences on how china is certainly not number one would prove my pointsEvidence 1  Many claim that China will soon overtake the US This column argues that this claim is based on a misuse of statistics ICP price data is necessary to compare living standards since a dollars worth of yuan buys more in China than a dollar buys in the US But the fact that rice and clothes are cheap in rural China does not make the Chinese economy larger What matters for size in the world economy is how much a yuan can buy on world markets Using the correct prices the US remains the worlds largest economic power by a substantial marginThe ICP numbers compare countries GDPs using PPP rates rather than actual exchange rates This is the right thing to do if you are interested in individual living standards It is the wrong thing to do if you are interested in measuring a countrys weight in the global economy I would argue When thinking about a countrys size in the world economy its how much the yuan can buy on world markets that is of interest PPP tells you how many haircuts and other local goods it can buy in ChinaThe bottom line for China is that it has a ways to go before it surpasses the US by either criterion  income of the average Chinese  correctly measured with PPP rates or aggregate size of the Chinese economy  GDP correctly measured at actual exchange rates This in no respect detracts from the countrys impressive growth record which at about 10  per annum for three decades constitutes a historical miracle  Prasad 2009  Frankel 2014Evidence 2  The US economy remains the largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP The 1942 trillion US economy is 25  of the gross world product The United States is an economic superpower that is highly advanced in terms of technology and infrastructure and has abundant natural resources However the US economy loses its spot as the number one economy to China when measured in terms of GDP based on PPP In these terms Chinas GDP is 2319 trillion exceeds the US GDP of 1942 trillion However the US is way ahead of China in terms of GDP per capita in nominal terms as well as PPP  GDP per capita  PPP for the US economy is approximately 59609 versus 16676 in China In nominal terms Chinas GDP per capita further falls to 8480  Bajpai 2017Evidence 3 China follows with 11 trillion or 148  of the world economy Japan is in third place with an economy of 44 trillion which represents almost 6  of the world economyEuropean countries take the next three places on the list  Germany in fourth position with a 33 trillion economy  the United Kingdom in fifth with 29 trillion  and France in sixth with 24 trillionIndia is in seventh place with 2 trillion and Italy in eighth with an economy of over 18 trillionNinth place goes to Brazil with an almost 18 trillion economyAnd in 10th is Canada with an economy of over 15 trillionThe economy of the United States is larger than the combined economies of numbers three to 10 on the list  Alex 2017Citations 1 Frankel J  2014 China is not yet number one   VOX CEPRs Policy Portal  online  Voxeuorg Available at  http voxeuorgarticlechina not yet number one  Accessed 9 May 2004 2Bajpai P  2017  online  Available at  ains the largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP The 1942 trillion US economy is 25  of the gross world product The United States is an economic superpower that is highly advanced in terms of technology and infraRead more  The World s Top 10 Economies   Investopedia https wwwinvestopediacomarticlesinvesting022415worlds top 10 economiesaspixzz52aV4byKRFollow us  Investopedia on Facebook  Accessed 7 Jul 2017 3Gray A  2017 The worlds 10 biggest economies in 2017  online  World Economic Forum Available at  https wwwweforumorgagenda201703worlds biggest economies in 2017  Accessed 9 Mar 2017 ,positive

If you are looking for an amazingly entertaining battle arena game then this is the oneThis game has had a lot of problems in the past but the developers have worked day after day to make this game the best it can be Comparing this game to games like H1Z1 or Fortnite is like comparing Chocolate to Apples This is the best battle royale game that can currently be experiencedPros   Graphics are amazing even on low  Maps are huge and have loads of details  Constant support from developers  Attatchments on guns is an amazing mechanic  Each gun is completly different  Loads of different playstyles  Loads of different guns  Huge amount of character customizationCons   This game is not fun if you play it for ages everyday as you get tired of itOverall this game is amazing and despite the games lasting long they are extremly fun  even if you get sniped when you are 1 of the last 2 remainingThere are so many expensive games on steam and an amazing one is sittting right here with a cheaper price range Yes it only has one mode but you will find yourself going back and back again to it,positive

This is the greatest multiplayer game I have ever played I have never played a game for this many consecutive hours When I turn it off and go to bed I am already looking forward to playing it again After 500 hours I still encounter new situations every day to learn from And it is such a great social game The looting phase is done while chatting and then you work together with your friends throughout sometimes intensive sometimes strategic situations Thanks for the well spent money,positive
Played a lot of this game it had potential to become huge but the devs screwed it With the amount of money they made already the lootboxes should come in the form as Heroes of the Storm or Overwatch has  but no  we need to milk more money out of succes  the devs should take their heads out of their asses and look around and learn from other succesfull devs like blizzard This game could change the gaming industry but they missed their chance and the lawsuit against Fortnite  OMG the people behind that idea should be instantly firedI hope that Fortnite will take the rights on engine from PUBG and it will be finnaly overThe people responsible for this situation should be fired and burned on gaming crossDefinetely do not buy this game until the whole of Blue Hole staff gets fired,negative

Hard to believe a game that is so one dimensional and riddled with issues  bugs poor development etc made it s way to the top of the PC gaming culture in such little time as PUBG has I enjoyed playing this game with my friends for 237 hours and I definitely think I ve gotten my 30 worth out of the game but there have been so many times I just wanted to refund or permanently uninstall this piece of hot garbage due to network errors shoddy bullet registry glitches and much more  that I couldn t imagine spending money on it now knowing what it s like Not to mention regardless of your intent or playstyle PUBG only offers the same exact gameplay experience match after match time and time again I m aware other games are prone to this as well but there s just something so incredibly stagnant and boring about dropping off a plane 10000 times just to do the same things over and over At it s current position I couldn t recommend this game to anyone at all despite my initial craze over it several months ago The way this game seemed and was hyped has definitely faded by now and I ve had time to let my thoughts gather truly analyze the game and I conclude that it s simply another fad A game that will be played religiously for a few months more by Twitch partners and the like to get their viewspaycheck as they spoonfeed you the next horrible title  you just have to buy  next quarter,negative

500 hours and still love this game it is very fun with friends and even solo mode is very challenging As many other people have written there are still some bugs that might kill you or ruin your current match however developers are very active and listening to the community feedback providing many fixes and patchesThis has been the best early access i have tried as there is substancial and real improvement on the game since it launched back on March As everything else in life you might like it or not so i really recommend to watch some videos or streams first  And if you have friends who are interested even better in order to start fighting for your chicken dinner AkA  winner    Believe me having some chicken dinner is extremely satisfyingI hope this encourages you to at least try this excellent game and experience the feeling of a battle royale game,positive

The game was decent not great It is very very buggy and rather than address issues developers are working on skins which  caused and even bigger problem by banning inter player trading essentially allowing steam to collect a 15  tax on any exchange of items Don t get it if your computer is less than 1k dollars and don t get it if you want a company that isn t money hungry AF Otherwise it s the game for you,negative

poorly optimized but fun game,positive
Is this worth 30  In it s current state  no This isn t anything directly to do with a game design issue but the philosophy behind the development I could give the lootbox rant but they have only done that once so far But the two pressing issues with the game are terrible serversnetcode  Don t know exactly which and I m not going to put more effort into debugging than the devs and hacking The former problem is never truly gone but it has its good nights where the main annoyance is a small amount of lag on openingclosing doors and it s bad nights where you won t be able to get through a door for 5 10 seconds My personal experience on the issue is just to flip a coin on whether you ll be able to play  half of the time you ll be SOL The latter problem is the real one that breaks it for me and turns it into a vehicle to screw with friends without really adding a good experience There are plenty of videos on the internet that show you some of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  they pull so I ll get to the issue  the devs aren t fixing it and are choosing to focus on upcoming updates like the desert map Don t get me wrong devs adding more to their game is a great thing and still needs to be done in this game s case due to the one map issue just with different instagram filters on it but the game is going to be just as frustrating to play when you know that more than likely at least one of the 90 odd people has some sort of cheat going It makes every death a question of  Was that guy using cheats   when it should be  What can I do better   The devs have come out saying that they re banning a lot of people in short time spans but it doesn t seem to have helped with the end user experience I would recommend holding on to the money or finding something else until they ve patched the game enough to not make it a hair pulling experience,negative
This is a world with many plugs so many that you can t image I liked this game and enjoyed it at the beginning But now sorry gays this is a game to be avoided  absoultly Save your money and your time there are many other good ones for us,negative

It s my very first title in the Battle Royale genreThe game may still be in early access but it s pretty damn good it just needs more polishing and optimization The game is far from perfect some still have rendering issues  I fixed mine by using window s ready boost and can be a bit buggy at times There can also be cheaters every other round which can be annoying but most of the times there aren t Given that I don t really like shooters I find this one enjoyable due to the Battle Royale aspect if it you can play tactically and methodically to get that sweet chicken dinner unlike most shooter games where you can just run wild and hold the LMB because you ll respawn anyways Another thing that I like on this type of shooter is that there s no real way to play it you can go wild shooting down enemies at the beginning then go play methodically avoiding conflict and still to win the end game,positive

This game models its development after the morons over at Ubisoft 1 come up with cool idea2 release it completely and utterly broken3 don t fix its gamebreaking issuesIf you are a game developer and follow these three simple steps then you will surely profit by putting the minimal amount of effort into a project that used to be considered an art form Good job In short this game has a fun concept but its servers are not up to par the framerate constantly dips and it has crashed on multiple occations I even tried sending a crash report but that crashed too Please don t buy this lazy and pathetic excuse for a game,negative

Amazing game lots of fun for eitehr solos duos or as a team Very well made and brilliant gameplay all round However it is still in Early Access and therefore is filled with bugs and glitches that will be smoothed over in later updates and stages in its developmentWould recommend but do not be angry if you re hit with severe bugs as the test server is there on it to allow users to play and give feedback on issues and bugs within the game to be fixed,positive

I have played PUBG for a while now and i personally have never had any encounters with hackers Yes sometimes the servers are a bit laggy but i only have lag 1 out of 20 games  Keep in mind i usually have about 40 mgbs The devs have been working pretty hard on the new map and overall improvements to the game I agree with everyone saying it needs more optimization because a game like PUBG should never go below something like 40 fps The game is a blast to play with friends but is a bit boring when joining random squads I think PUBG offers some fairly intresting and unique gaming moments OVER ALL Gameplay 810Optimization 610Fun Factor 910,positive
If you are buying this game under the assumption that it is buggy unoptimized lag ridden repetitive and boring after two matches then you better lower your expectations before purchasing this game,negative

So far I ve played the game 432 hours and I have to say while it can be boring at times it s only if you use my previous tactic of sitting in a building for an hour and not actually playing the game properly I ve yet to come across a hacker to my knowledge  except for one questionable death in the PTR The game is very entertaining in my opinionHowever there are some issues with the game 1 The game s optimisation is awful I recommend you play with very low everything except textures which I have at medium2 The game as it is can be a bit boring but it is in early access and is being updated frequently I currently mainly play on the PTR due to the climbing mechanic and new map which makes the game much better3 The point rewards system is unbalanced between solos duos and squadsOverall though PUBG is a great game that has a lot of potential,positive

After sinking countless hours into this game plus the time I ve spent on the test servers I feel like I can have a pretty good idea of how I really feel about everythingFirst off I m really counting on this game to get better after if gets out of early access in a few days because anything in my review could be argued with the classic early access excuseI figure I start with the pros just so I can start on a positive note because I m still very hopeful for the future of this gamePROS  I don t know how they did it but this game is one of the most enjoyable games to play with friends Some of my best moments in this game were when we ran into a funnynon gamebreaking glitch that doesn t stomp our game or when planning a perfect ambush with outstanding execution  Killing other players is satisfying  most of the time this may only just be a side effect of the battle royale aspect of the game and not just be specific to PUBG but no one is going to convince me that the feeling when you nail a runningdriving headshot with a Kar98k isn t magicThe next few are specific to the current test server I won t do any cons on the test server however assuming most of the rubberbanding and HEAVY crashing issues are fixed  Miramar is     ing gorgeous I adore that map less room for pansy players and more for quick reaction times and  MMPH  the Winchester Keep fixing all of the weak points in the map that your players have been posting on the forum and I believe you have a genuine masterpiece of a map  The new vehicle mechanics are fantastic as well no more suicide bike  for the most part vehicles are more encouraged to use the road poppable motorcycle tires spinouts rollovers and most of all the buggy horn Thanks for working on that Blueballs   The vaulting implementation was something that I was extremely skeptical about at first but I actually haven t ran into any heavily exploited glitches brought by vaulting that other players have used Vaulting has been smooth and enjoyable especially since players can designate a key exclusive for vaulting Thumbs up from meCONS Load into a game after two crashes with two failed crash reports Drop into a moderately hot zone like Prison Aiming for the roof of Main Building Try to hit close to the edge to land first Parachute freaks out and sends me flying to the ground 25  HP Run into the bottom floor to find a gun spawn Spot an AK but rubberbanding back outside of the building Player runs in from the other bottom floor entrance and grabs AK Hear two shots while still outside of the building 842266423541 killed YOU by headshot with AKM ctrlaltdelete task manager end taskThe number of times that or something similar has happened makes me want to play     ing Dark Souls for the rest of my life but to break down those issues   The crashing Ohhhh the crashing  Parachuting needs serious work it is beyond frustrating to be stuck in midair at school while spamming F then fling off the roof  Why does a player named 5465432487 have better connection than me   My biggest issue with this game right now are the cheaters Any form of cheating in vidya makes me sick to my stomach people deliberately trying to just ruin the game for other players I don t care how strict or sensitive of a anti cheat you implement but playing the game for 20 minutes to get killed across the map by XiongChinaXiong makes me not want to put any more time into the game Fat kids literally streaming on twitch with blatant hacks and bragging about it is absolute garbage and I don t think I ll be putting any more hours in the game if the heavy cheating continues into 2018  The sound needs to get fixed for sure I appreciate being able to tell direction most of the time  As I should in a game where soundsound direction is everything I     ing LOATHE not being able to tell where a shot came from though because of a pompous WHAP and AEUGH sound make by my character I m jumping out of my chair from how loud those sounds are meanwhile my health is halved and I m cluelessly running behind a tree to bandage only to get shot in the head a second time by the same player from who knows  The entire crate system feels like a joke finally waiting until the BP cost resets then proceeding to open three  3 working boots in a row Just not very creative and I m bored of the only desirable items being the gas masks ballistic mask and coats I hope they improve the cosmetics in the game without adding dumb    keys and purchasable ingame currency  Speaking of in game currency I feel like the payout after 35 minutes of gameplay and winning is extremely underwhelming I mean at least you get the reward of your heart rate finally slowing down and a washing feeling of relief but I think you should at least unlock a crate right then and there rather than 1000 something BP which sometimes won t even get you a single crateCONCLUSIONI hate to copy off of what someone else said but I couldn t have said it better Bluehole only got to the battle royale genre first that s it  Besides H1Z1 you     wit because some of us enjoy hit reg and desirable game mechanics If PUBG Corporation doesn t fix all of these issues before another company worth a damn comes out with a better lookingbetter playing battle royale game this game will die I feel like the battle royale genre is a perfect genre to show off the upcoming future generation of video games and I hope bigger companies take it further610,negative

PUBG is a fun game with some tense and rewarding moments that is heavily weighed down by things like glitches hackers and lag It s a fun game but it isn t worth the 30USD pricepoint at the time of this review I would reccommend waiting for a sale or the game to get out of early access before you buy,negative

NahMaps are to big play is exceptionally boring ive got 20 hours in this game and it has the potential to be amazingits just not in anyway 17 hours of boredom marked by 15 minutes of fun  being generous maps are wayyyyyy to big not enough action Also cannot understand team members as they speak usually some kind of chineese and it makes for dismal team play Save your money Worst purchase ive made on steam yet,negative
Very Fun Sometmes more then enough over relaxing and very hard to aim     AIM HA the aim needs very much improving for those of us who have high end equitment yet very over the head onboard video card serviceit to hard D DJagger likeTHAT s what ruins the game alltogether not worth playing an it s rather hoping right back on another game and if YOU are reading and you have hot hands I REALLY MEAN IT Thnax 0 ,negative

PUBG is a great game i totally recommend this game to new buyers,positive
I think that most people agree that pubg shouldnt have been a nominee for game of the year It is a really good game to me but it s just that it s not finished But let s move onPubg follows the simple rule of kill or be killed For some unknown reason you start out in a small island with about 95 players No one can kill each other and guns are just laying on picnic tables Suddenly you appear on a plane and have to jump out at the first spot you see You jump and slowly descend to the ground with your parachute You notice that their is 20 other people that droped on the same random house as you You grab the first gun you see and someone runs at you and finds the best  gun in the Damm game and kills you Now you sit their wondering what just happened,positive
rage inducing at times but still really fun proves it s a good game,positive

Despite the servers and connections got improved the overall gaming experience drastically declined as hackers flooding into game and what Bluehole has done to it was far from satisfactoryThings become even worse when it comes to noctorious streamers hacking in front of thousands of viewers without getting the ban they deserve I strongly recommand you to stand away from both PUBG and Bluehole,negative

I still cannot reccomend PUBG after 10 and several patches Still unreasonably buggy for a full release game Also the volume of hackers is unnacceptable The amount of times I have been killed by players snapping their aim onto my head is higher than any other PC shooter I have ever played I really like this game when it goes well but it just isn t worth my time I would reccomend Rainbow six seige over this game if you want a similarly priced shooter game that is just better Also 250 for a key to open a crate in a 30 is unnacceptable TLDR unplayable until the hacking stops and the bugs are fixed,negative

Do you like long lasting battles with some minor glitches   Early accessI bought this game 2 months ago thinking this would be ok to try out   the consept of 100 uniqe players battling against eachother on an island was epic First 10 15 tries I where playing like an headless looter chicken Best tip I can give you is that you grab a weapon  then sneak throught all areas Easyest way to reach top 10 or even a free chicken dinner All in all I would rate it at this state as a B there is still a lot to do regarding movement weapons aim and minor things But if you want an exiting game with alot of lolz and keyboardsmashing memories then this is the game for you,positive
If the anti cheat for this game wasen t the worst anti cheat to be created and used this game would be the best but since every 11 game has some form of hacker this game went from good to trash real quickEDIT  The anti cheat is a complete joke and should be removed entirely I have no correlation with any type of hack and yet got an automatic ban for who knows why If a game s anti cheat ban s legit players and keeps the cheaters you have a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game The dev s and anti cheat are completely useless in every way and the game is still non stop lag FPS drop and glitches despite having officially released and been in over a year of public developement,negative

Playing with people online can have it s benefits and downsides This game shows both Knowing there are 100 people in one game and only one person can come out top and you may be the top dog or the one that carries the top dog to victory The Battle Royal genre has always interested me in many ways PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS has a very unique style to it coming from H1Z1 I love this game and will continue to love it even though there are people whom are better than me,positive

This game is a blast by yourself and with friends aslong as your computer can handle it that is The gunplay is so good and satisfying and I keep wanting to come back for me There are some downsides to the game unfortunatly one being optimization but theres no point covering this because everyone knows about it Another downside would probably be buggyness of the cars and characters themselves You could be having a great game but you crash your car it gets jammed in a wall and explodes killing you Game over Other than that the game is great and I recommend that you get this when  you get the chance,positive

I have a solution here in the textSehr gutes Spiel mit noch einigen Bugsich habe dazu ne Lsung hier im TextDas Spiel luft fr eine Early Acces sehr gut Ich spiele seit ein paar Wochen nur auf den Test ServernDie EU Server haben das strkste Rubberbanging aber man kann ja einfach auf die NA Server wechselt Da das Spiel noch in Endwicklung ist sind Bugs normalMit den Sounds hat man nur Bugs wenn man nen schlechen Soundchip hat Wenn man den Ton ber Grakikkarte mit HDMI Kabel an einen AV Receiver gibt hat man Gar keine Sound BugsNutzt man den Onboard Sound oder eine Creative Soundkarte hrt man die Fahrzeuge nicht wenn die weiter weg sindAlgemein werden auch dann wenn sehr viele Gerusche gleichzeitig vorhanden sind einige ausgblendet wenn man halt nicht den Ton ber die Grafikkarte oder eine ASUS Strix Soundkarte nutztIch habe es mit verschiedenen Soundkarten ausprobiert und da sind mir dann diese Kombinationen aufgefallenThe game is running very well for an early acces I ve only been playing on the test servers for a few weeks nowThe EU servers have the strongest rubberbanging but you can just switch to the NA serverSince the game is still in development bugs are normalThe sounds are only bugs if you have a bad sound chipIf one gives the sound over Grakikkarte with HDMI cable to an AV receiver one has no sound bugsIf you use the onboard sound or a creative sound card you will not hear the vehicles when they are farther awayIn general even if there is a lot of noise at the same time some will fade out if you do not use the sound on the video card or an ASUS Strix sound cardI have tried it with different sound cards and then I noticed these combinations,positive

totally stopped playing as i heard they are court plans against Epic its epic developed motor that these blueaholes use anyways claiming fortnite has similarities to PUBG well in that case daybreak games will sue PUBG over the same thing and result is that players loose though loosin PUBG is not a big deal BYE nice watch you the past weeks playerunknown as you were comitting your suicide WORLDISABETTERPLACENOW_TYEDITED TO NOT RECOMMENTED They Scammed meus F U POOPG form BlueAholejolly good fun most of the time though im not feeling the new trade ban and most likely a suicide attempt funny they want to force steam marked trading only with takes 20  more of the value of items as steam TAX also there is the news atleast rumors cannot not confirm are they true on not of TRADE UP SYSTEM wich is kinda fitting wich the schemereason for the trade ban is basically that someone is also making money of the skins wich they allready paid money for and they got with 99  certainty less value than they put in and since basically PUGB is selling ZEROES and ONES their mark up is 100 basically they are punishing everyone cause someone does something that they dont like its like if a robbery is committed by 1 person we JAIL EVERYONE on planet earth just to be safebesides who are they to limit loot systems AS I LAST HEARD the netherlands and belgium rule loot boxes ILLEGAL GAMBLING so its basically CRIMINALS fighting other CRIMINALS for the control of the RACKETS  ACTUAL GAME REVIEW player movement is kinda sticky though feel it specially after playing csgo or say a few hour session of far cry 5and then theres those few very annoying bugs wich are being ironed out though im talking bout the occasional stuck on rock glithces where u cant get away from  rather rare nowadays as these are fixed supposedly as reports come inand theres is the lagdesync issue or something first u exchange a hail of bullets u get hit few times and are around 30 40 healt then u move away from the line of sight clearly behind a wall but still somehow 2 shot hit u that is frustrating to say the least hoping for improvements on the new weapon balance patch maybe thru sync improvements and if my memory servers me there were modifications to the knockback on damage system i mean its pretty ridiculous to take a 762 between the eyes and not having that affect your aimshot about to go off in the next 01 05 seconds  Di guess something should be done about the loot placement just last game i checked about 25 big houseswarehouses and about 20 sheds and and best weapon i found was a pistol  there was 1 shotty but i didnt pick it up on the other hand i found every possible attachment and bullets by the dozen alot of 556s with no gun  atleast 4x same goes for 762s but half of the time they were next to the revolver had 2 red dots 1 2x 2 4x and 8x level 3 vest and backpack with level 2 helmet 2 medkits and all the firstaid kits and boost u could want i remember reading that this should be possible anymore but it is as it just happened  looted every place in kamenski and the next 2 areas south down the roadin my opinion moving the 8x and level 3 helmet to the drop loot only aint the answer but im anctiosly waiting for the 12 patch with the weapon rebalansing and new loot distribution  maybe  same goes for cars and motorbikes and boats they just arent anywhere sometimes and your just medding while waiting for certain death to come since there are no rides and this is the 4th circle aka the death circle wich has moved as far from you as possiblebut all in all its a game in developement and they are improving most of the time i would say 910 EDIT  610 all together specially delighted for the upcoming map selection and the date to be confirmed new map to wich they provided the experimental test server for testing for existing PUBG owners im not sure about the most common request about region locksrestrctions but i feel some kinda ping limit should be implemented and what people say about the cheater im not sure havent come a cross many few very platantly clear ones but its not common in my opinion  EU FPPtotally recommend it though i mean its fairly priced too   and you need something to play since H1Z1 and CSGO are somewhat MEH due to various reasons,negative

Fun game but I cannot recomend it in its current state The game is riddled with bugs like your gun not scoping in you not being able to fire not being able to reload and a bunch of minor stuff that I would normally forgive in an early access title My biggest issue with this game is the rediculous amount of cheaters in the game which the dev team seem to care nothing about You can play a full game only to be killed by 4 guys jumping around and headshotting everyone in a 500m radius out them And PlayerUnknown has the audacity to try to make this an esport On release this was actually a worthy purchase but right now if I could refund it I would but that ship has sailed,negative

I have always maintained that PUBG is absolute crap but that the Battle Royale game mode is so inherently fun that it is still a fun game to play However with the recent update on the Test Server showing what 10 should look like I think I can safely say that PUBG is no longer crap and has set the bar quite high for all the upcoming Battle Royale games coming in the next 2 years Would recommend,positive

A lot of people LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing that the game is in alpha for 6 months that the game is not optimized Freaking hell guys this game has been developed in the last months more than any other same genre game has in 1 2 years Not to mention they will release the full product in a couple of weeks For people complaining about optimization and bugs go try the test server PS  Lag on test server doesn t mean the game is broken it just means that a peak of 150k players in a test server is a bit too much to handle some triple A games don t even reach a peak of 100k in their finished product,positive
This game is just another money grab that makes no effort to improve on themselves and or make apparent that it even take the communities recommendations serriously I would stay away from this game if you re looking for balanced and consitent game play,negative
This game is chalking up to be game of the year 2018 The last round of the test servers this week prior to launch with the new desert map is amazing It looks great I would recommend this game over all other Battle Royle games This one holds the crown Very realistic Very true Not acrade style like other games similar to genre Ive sold enough gear off this game to pay for itself,positive
hours of fun no two games are the same Like most online competative games there are hackers It sucks but they are working on it and do have a report button still would recomend the game,positive
This game is great but needs more optimization and more maps they have not done much for optimization on older parts i have a gtx 1050 and it still does not run above 50fps on low they are about to release a new map but less new guns would be better more maps and stuff to make the game feel new the first map is great but new maps are needed,positive
Best game on steam hands down,positive
VENOMZ AGAINST PRONING,negative
This game is far too loot oriented the circle moves too fast and many mechanics are designed just to ruin the player s day For example Red Zone is just a slap in the face The bomber plane in H1Z1 was much more interesting You hear it coming look up desperately in search of it s position and direction run like hell for 5 seconds In PUBG Players are forced to waste a ton of time just waiting for it to end sometimes even as the blue zone is coming in and can even cut off access to the bridge tofrom military island,negative

DOESNT LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING WORK,negative
Sure the game is buggy laggy and the optimal way for playing is changing every setting  other than view distance to low But I love the sht out of this game Yes I m a sadistic bstard,positive
Granted the game is still early access I think the game still has a lot of potential Its came a long way over the past several months and with the new update just around the corner I think the future of this game is looking better and better I do wish they would speed the process of stopping the hackers would be great because that is probably the most frustrating experience and downfall to the game I have had so far Overall I think the game is a 910 and I would definitely reccommend it to someone,positive
really clunky glitchy combat system laggy servers and cheaters everywhere,negative

there are plenty of reasons as to why this game is not recommended BY MENR1 lack of serversIt would be very nice if they added south african servers and in other reagions tomore than 200 South African players in one steam group that are forced to play out of reagionNR2 a terrable AC SystemI can t turn a corner without a cheater up in my face710 times i would find a cheater in a matchNR3 a bad engineBattlefield1 runs ultra setting 100 110fpsthis game can run high setting 50fps in places like buildings and while in 1st person veiwNR4 unrequired  paches  and updatesDevelopers spend to much time on dumb things like giving female characters cammel toes and not the things that the game actualy needsthen thry can move on the DIY pornNR5 no focus on things like oneshot headshot with a 556 for exampleand if a cars tire gets shot i think the cars speed should be decreased by 50 And so i can go on but i would decide to spare myself510 overall,negative
PUBG is probably one of the best Early Access games I have tried It can be fun but it can be frustrating as well Unfortunately their Battleye isn t functioning properly so you can run into hackers which I have done a few times alreadyThe lag in the beginning in the game can be very annoying when you just landed with the parachute which can course early deathYou should get higher rewards depending on which rank you get I ve experienced only get 140 credits for being on rank 2 which is really not anythingBut overall I think the game can be funI will recommend to play with 1 3 friends,positive

Great game loads of funAllot of people are complaining about FPS drops etc But they are forgetting they bought an early access game that is still in development This isnt even close to the finished product I do hope that the  Release update  is going to fix a few problems and maybe add more moderators to check out and find cheaters Maybe add VAC  That would scare out allot of cheaters,positive
seems fun,positive
a lot of people seem to get mad about how the game is updated  or not updated whatever but after all the time i have into this game even through the ups and downs from the first day of EA i would suggest it to anyone who wants a good shooter you arent going to win every match but when you do it feels better than winning any shooter tdm match by a long shot,positive
The weapons need a bit of more attachments like BATTLEFIELD 4,positive
pretty good fun and engaging Just lacks some real optimisation,positive
Great fun and addictive,positive
too many hackers i have 650 hours logged on this game and the rampant hacking is going to be the downfall,negative
Almost in the same terrible state it was at launch GTX 1080 and Ryzen 5 and get roughly 90 105 fps changing any settings seem to horribly effect the frame rate even when lowering certain graphicsIt was fun at first but the constant lag and choppy feel with no real increase in optimization make it seem stale yet the devs decided to throw microtransactions in a completely unfinished gameEven worse they are porting to consoles  I m sorry the game is NOT complete Don t waste money on this lost cause it will never live up to the hype and I bet the devs decided to try and milk as much money out of before they abandon ship,negative
Fix your gameUpdate 3312018   FIX YOUR GAMEUpdate 552018   FIX YOUR GAMEUpdate 5292018   Memo to game developers accross the world To deal with hacking pretend that you are dealing with it Every so often make a big display about hack developers and hackers then business as usual However never do anything about the hackers in reality,negative
Poorly optimized is an understatement The coding for this game is literally the worst out there on the market The devs don t plan on fixing this issue either Half of the community just gives the devs a pass and say  buy a new pc  Ok let me go spend 1k on a new pc for one unfinished early access game when I can run BF1 at 60fps The hit detection in the game is bad the jumping and moving mechanics are bad the driving mechanics are bad the variety in weaponry is bad the community is bad the devs are bad This game has ZERO good attributes On top of that the majority of the time spent in game is spent by either auto running or holding Shift and W in a car to play catch up with the bubble Overall this game is just flat out bad and it will remain in Early Access until the day the population is zero Don t buyEdit 6 months later Everything is still perfectly relevent except the desync may be an even bigger issue now You will die after going 15 feet around a corner squating and starting a first aid while on their screen you never even made it to the corner This game will NEVER  truly leave early access,negative
Hit detection is absolute garbage optimization is absolute garbage the servers are garbagethis game is garbage,negative
Biggest disappointment of all games I have purchased so farThis game runs terrible and doesnt even look particularly good and the only reason this game has become popular are streamersEven with my gtx 980ti overclocked and i7 4790k  44 GHz on low settings it just doesnt run stable with frequent stuttering in every situationThe game also feels really buggy and there is a lot of random LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that can happen to ruin your gameI always hoped the devs would finish this game at some point but over the few months I ve been playing this game nothing improved the experience at all Even with the latest patch which changed some of the gameplay mechanics there are still the same major issues that make this game really unenjoable And since this game will get its final release in just a few days I feel like the devs have failed us customers horriblyAfter all there are only 20 million people  me included to blame for buying an unfinished game thus relieving all the pressure on the devs to create something decentEarly Access is not just a good thing,negative
good game what i like in this game  every game is a the difference story funny gameplay need skill and Brains but have a problems to 1 very big problem is a cheaters in game 2 need more FPS and low PING 3 System requirements are wery hi which is very unpleasant for those who do not have the means to do that and there are many people on earth It will be better if the game is optimized soon,positive
This game is one of the best games i have ever played There are not always action packed parts in your game but when there are it gets so intense The game isn t that well optimized  but a decent computer should run it,positive
This game can t run properly on my pc even though it meets all of the rquierements It s literally unplayable,negative
I just don t understand what s your problem guys with this game Only thing i was mad about was when u could get banned bby stream sniping ok that was absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t but why all of you talking about not optimalized game This game is 2k17 on ultra it is just beautiful game and that means you have to have kinda good PC to run it well I love when low end PC owners crying how they cant play new games just for example Assassins creed origns cuz bad GPU or graphic card so why the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  u talking about PUBG in other way and putting  negative feedback  Just upgrade ur comptuer There wont be update that will give u 100fps on high with gtx640 god dammit Or u can play that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  boring games like FortniteEdit1  english is not my mature languageEdit2  if ur profile picture is from anime or you are under 14 dont comment this,positive

At this point in time it is hard for me to recommend the game Hear me out thoughWith over 450 hours  I have 40 hours on test server as well and around 65 wins It s safe to say there s a huge lovehate relationship with this game No other game has made me feel this way in a long timeThe game is great nobody can deny that Although there are many aspects that draw in a lot of negativity towards the game for example    No recoil hacks are still kind of around I see them every now and again on OC FPP in top 500  Desync still plays a major factor in many deaths that I have gotten eg Aiming around a corner really quick on your screen but on the server  Killcam you are staring around the corner for more than 2 seconds  Red zones can be a huge problem due to how RNG they are In my personal opinion they should be removed  Lootboxes are quite ridiculous at the moment and it pretty much forces you to buy what clothing item or weapon skin you desire through the expensive marketplace They could fix this by implementing a system similar to Call of Duty or Battlefield where you can unlock new cosmetics by completing challengesSuggestions   Please get rid of clothing items in game It s quite annoying when you pick up some boots instead of a rifle  Add a practice rangecustom maps  FIX THE THREE SEATER PLS  Chicken dinner rewards  A rare clothing item or skin  Add the ability to spectate after you have been killed  Reduce the time in pre game lobbies I don t want to wait 3 minutes for another game to start  Lastly WE WOULD LOVE A MAP SELECTION BLUEHOLEAnyway there s just a couple of my thoughts at this current time The game has so much potential it s just a matter of how the devs treat it Right now I would probably give the game a 6510  Slighty above average,positive
In my opinion it is the best  Battle Royal  game out there in the market right now to play  however there are a lot of things that lack to make this a  perfect  game For instance server stability bugs and hackers make the game annoying to play time to time not always though I ll give it an 8510 If Bluehole is able to annihilate all of those I think anybody can enjoy playing this game,positive

I feel very disappointed about this game In a situation where the anchor is so blatant not only does he not stand up but also wants to be neutral This is contempt for Chinese players,negative
While still in early access this game is an amazing concept The devolpment is moving along quickly and it seems that it may even come out as the full game by the end of 2017 It is extremely fun with friends It is not to well optimized and requires a somewhat decent pc to run it 810 for unfinished product,positive
dis game make me angry  dont know why  ,positive
Expect glitches Expect client crashes Expect lag Doesn t sound like much fun right  It s an early access game Don t expect perfection and don t go into it thinking that it s going to be an amazing quality game Yes you may come across a hacker or two but it s still a fun game to play with a squad of friends,positive

I will admit it s a fun game but beware if you use msi afterburner G force exp I did get banned for about 4 5 days because they thought i was using aim bots and other lays1 thing i strongly dislike is that the china and american severs are bassically the same and if you only know english as i doIts also tereible idea for a commution based game that mixes 2 veryyyyy different country s on american sever2 Think before spending the money Like the game isnt finished but you can banned for the dumbest of reason s3 Beware what you say and how you say  4 if battle royle is all you care about this then play fortnite for free 5 it is a fun addicting game but with all the bugs and randoms ban s going on idk if you should spend the money 6 try it first if you know someone that has it before you buy7 i do think the is not worth the 30 tag for a mod of another game 8 i do think it will be worth it in the future hopefully 9 if you have a lower end pc good luck with the graphics and building loading 10  it funs addicting 3rd or 1st person shooter  but think before you spend on anything,positive
Greatest Scam in the gaming industry at only 30 at a time Sorry for the inconvience    Bluehole has no concept of what they re doing how to code a game or how to fix it  Netcode is a joke server performance is awful and the tickrate is a pathetic Ive been with this game since Alpha and It is amazing that after 2 years they have done little to improve the overall mechanics of the game Save  your money and wait for another  BR,negative

This is an incredibly bad game which lacks any features that is properly implemented in many other games It s a joke that a character can t jump out of the window of a house because the mechanics does not even exist Unbelievable that a game which has millions of players is not paying attention to it and only releasing such features when they want to remove this shame  Early Access  label to make it an esport game First of all try to fix your issues and don t just make people pay for a pile of cr p,negative

Yes it is early access but this game has such a huge fun potenttial at every level and aspect of its original gameplay  but then comes the issues we all pubg players are dealing with   CRASHES CRASHES CRASHES    this game needs serious optimization    playing in i7 42   ddr3 32gb ram 2400    and gtx 980   still manages to have some memory issues  or idk what else causes those crashes  LAGS      servers are laggy and sometimes shooting becomes like a joke well hope in full game all be fixed,negative

I m not going to talk about the graphics and game optimization in this review My suggestion   If you are a good FPS gamer then don t buy it because you are definitely a cheater under the publisher s view then the 30 bucks gone This game casually bans players  account  I was pulled in this game by my friends last Friday I tried to block the bridge and killed 9 people then I received a message saying I I permanently bannedTwo of my friends have encountered the same situation after they succeed to block a bridge in different roundsI doubt the game publisher did not checks want players data were anomalies and even do not understand how to figure out who is a cheater and who is not maybe its  benchmark to define a cheater  is simply how many reports by other players this account Yeah many guys were finished by me on the bridge I believed those birds reported me due to anger then the PUBG Corporation sacrificed me and my money to dispel its dads  angerTo be honest it s a huge honor to me that the publisher treats me my tactics and accuracy like a cheater unfairly But in my opinion the game publisher and manager are the biggest cheaters I do not think my friends and me were the only three victims under the publisher s chaos managementThis game was launched almost one year but the environment of gaming is continuing to become worse and  PUBG Corporation  did nothing to change and improve the environment they just ban anyone in this game if they want to and makes some players who are indulging in this game pay another 30 bucks WOW No wonder this game is the top sellerIt s my shame that this game is existing in my library,negative
so many cheater on this gamedamn,negative
I have a horrible addiction help me,positive
                      1080Ti,negative

good game but need optimization for smooth gameplay,positive
It s a good game sometimes,positive
Hackers Hackers Hacker esports ready glitches game breaking bugs seems really good,negative
This game might just be the biggest love hate relationship I ve ever had with a game I love winning and knowing that you managed to win out of 100 other players is a feeling like no other but on the flip side there is nothing more rage inducing than being top 10 and being sniped from a mile behind from someone still outside the zone The game does need to some work bug fixes more maps optimization But if you can manage to look past that then the game is amazing with a very intense and competative atmosphere,positive

Once this game is no longer in pre release my opinion will probably change But right now there are so many glitches and hackerscheaters that it s not worth playing Hopefully it changes with the new updates coming out,negative
Really fun concept and a good game at it s core The developers just really need to focus up and finish the full release of the game My biggest complaint is they have sold over 10 million copies at 30 each and they are starting to develop a new game without finishing this one firstWould still recommend as a good game to play with friends,positive

Great game in the battle royale genre Has some kinks to work out but it s a work in progress and a good one at that,positive
it s a fun game but only if you have friends to play it with  also VERY graphics demanding to run,positive
Alright there so many things wrong but I m gonna focous on the technical side mainly graphics Back when I got the game it ran jsust fine on my 750ti  which isn t that bad anyone who owns one could agree After some update though the game is garbage for me I cant load in I can only hear what is happening arround me No my files are in check and I m just mad that the devs have not optimized their game yet,negative
I d love to give this a great review unfortunatley it just can t recieve one do to the lack of effort put into optimization and and server maintinencelag I find myself losing fights so many times due to stupid fixable issues  textures not loading dropping frames de sync and hackers I should be winning these battles but instead my rank and attitude towards the game take a hit Just wish I could play it for what it was meant to be like FYI  I do meet the minimum requirements of the store page and I play on Very Low settings and the problems still persist,negative

Got shot a few times it was fun,positive
Left CSGO cause of cheaters  Better go back to it cause this game has 2x more cheaters than csgo Don t buy this game if you wan t to get headshoted from norecoil cheater,negative
IMO final release might be a very interesting game but ATM this game need better optimalization and better servers,negative
The servers take way too long for it to register that you picked up and item and i have been running into alot of network lag at random point in a good majority of games They also dont have region lock so if you want radom squad or duos pray to god you have someone that speaks english on NA servers  and i get that not everyone speaks english na but when you have every game with no english speakers you know its because of a lack of region lock,negative
Used to be fun now it sucksIt s just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing awful Every aspect of this game is terrible The performance the gun mechanics the anticheat the netcode the pvp All the fun people to play against have left only LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s remain Also the NA servers have been invaded by Ninjas using VPN sSteer clear of this PoS,negative

The game is really fun great concept and a good player base However after being in development for so long there are still many issues and glitches that still haven t been fixed To name a few   Guns not reloading  Cannot equip gun despite having it in the inventory  Cars hitting invisible walls  Poor optimization  Lag issuesThe main problemissue ruining it for me my mates and many others is that there are just too many hackers now There would be at least 1 hacker s in every 2 games They need to implement a better tribunal in this game because I don t really mind all the other issues since the game is fun It is really just the amount of hackers that is making me really hate this game right now,negative
Alright Alright Alright so after 80 whole hours of playing this game i finally won a match 80 flippin hours to win a whole 1 match which leads me to ask was it worth it  Well yeah nah yeah nahyeah would have to be my answer,positive
This game is a buggy mess with zero optimization I ve got better ways to spend my time,negative
So here s going to be an honest to god review completely free of trying to make my subjective view seem objectiveI ll make this short and sweet for you guysThis game has many upsides and downsides It is fun to play  especially with friends and can easily kill hours of your day The loot mechanics and playstyle is great I ve been following PlayerUnknown since his Dayz BR days However There are a few problems with the game that sometimes come in the way of the game It s still unoptimized and laggy While D sync isnt the worst problem here i constantly run into doors that wont work or do work just 3 seconds later  I have 1GB internet don t try to tell me it s my fault I ve seen countless people  including myself get stuck on props or map items I see vehicles glitch out and players glitch out Sometimes these glitches and bugs ruin the experience sometimes they make for some funny momentsAs for the devs and bluehole themselves They try to listen to the community and update the game  regulate rules as much as possible It s safe to say that this game has some work to be done hence the word ALPHA But I think after these bugs are tweaked and more content is put in this game will be among the top  or THE top BR out to date,positive
PUBG is the only game that I always lose but I still like it and I want to play more,positive

What else can I say about this game Let s have some chicken dinner,positive
As long as you don t come across hackers it is a pretty fun game,positive
In recent years the term Early Access has been muddied by broken promises unfinished messes and poor excuses for games I can confidently say that PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds does not fall under these terms PlayerUnknown and his team push out updates constantly with new features and guns adding to a game already filled with contentBeing one of the most played games on Steam PUBG needs no in depth introduction to it s concept all out war amongst 90   100 players The gameplay can be really addicting and incredibly intense and the feeling that comes from winning games on PUBG is insane Whilst there are many battle royale titles being released this year in my opinion it s PUBG that comes out on top against it s competitors If you re a fan of ARMA DayZ or previous BR gamesmods then look no further than PUBG Don t let the price put you off consider it s price an investment for the hundreds of hours that come forward as no two games will be the sameIt s great to be able to look at an early access title such as PUBG and know that it s not only in good hands but also has an incredible amount of potential in terms of gameplay and features,positive
This game have potencial,positive
This game is fun but still needs some work in the performance departement,positive

The Sync is so far off you can be safe behind a wall and the enemy still sees you running up and can kill your past selfMakes it difficult to play effectively,negative
As of right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone at all This game is fun as a concept you and up to 3 friends are thrown into a map with 100 other players all trying to kill you This game is not the first to do this but it is by far the best option if you re willing to give this game money Streamers are a big problem If you kill a streamer who wasn t paying attention then they will accuse you of stream sniping them and that means  you guessed it A temporary to permanent banRegion lock is not a thing Right now hacking is a serious problem and the players hacking are more than often from China That means they can hop into servers for other regions and ruin the experience for everyone else This game is supposedly the 5th most played game on the pc platform and if that s the case then this hacking crisis is absolutely unacceptable Wait to buy the game until they stop listening to streamers whine and region lock the servers or until China bans it for  violating socialistic values  or some other bull LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

I am honetsly amazed at the this game I bought it a few months after release and I am happy to say that the improvements are regularly rolling out To start at Erangel with limited gameplay options to advance to vaulting 3 maps and a nice selection of weaopns this game is great There are PLENTY of bugs and performance issues but the amount of fun ive had in this game makes it all worth it Fortnite may be free but I dont mind spending 25 on this when its so much fun I reccomend this game if you enjoy tactical shooters If you dont but you want BR play fortnite,positive

When I got this game it was early access and to behonest I gave it a bad review now after the final release its great It runs alot smoother than before for sure The maps are super detailed and beutiful The weapon mechanics are extremely realistic,positive
Overall great game with good mechanics as compared to H1Z1 KOTKArmaHowever the game has room for improvement in areas such as servers and player interaction with the environment Movement and interaction with objects is not as smooth as I hoped and is probably the only thing I dislike eg Opening doors or getting in vehicles proning using med kits,positive
The game is good let s get that out of the way it has the POTENTIAL to be something amazing That said running the game across all settings using both a SLI GTX 1080 set up and disabling one card entierly has resulted in poor performance no matter whatIf the performance gets fixed then it is easily recommended until then think twice about what you are willing to accept,negative
This game is great both from the freedom and the effect is very good,positive
DO YOU LIKE ENDING THE GAME IN THE SAME PLACE OVER AND OVER AGAIN  MILITARY BASE  WELL THIS GAME IS FOR YOU,negative

This game might the the number 1 BR game out right now but it smells like number 2Takes a good amount of time to really get the hang of Just now managing to drop in to high traffic areas and clear a decent amount of people Everything in this game is broken and even once 10 comes out things will probably still be broken Tons of fun though Not for the easily raged1010 best sphincter clencher of 2017,positive

This game has no right to be as good as it is I honestly am not joking when I say that you  feel a sense of pride and accomplishment  when you actually win a match The gameplay is pretty much what you would expect with a few more bugs than would otherwise be acceptable but at the end of the day it is just what you are looking for to kill time and play with friends While not a silly as other games it does give you a pretty enjoyable comedic experience and maybe you ll be lucky enough to land a chicken dinner twice or more in a few games,positive

Dear PUBG I love the game but figure out your crap Hackers are taking over your game It s not enjoyable to play when a guy sits at the tower of Rozhok and headshots everyone with a P92 If it happened a few times ok but there s a hacker almost every other game I play  especially duos I report them all but the problem seems to only be getting bigger Please figure out how to ban them more efficiently and I ll change my reviewThe dev s don t know where their heads are My best friend just got banned for  cheating  and he barely plays the game He only plays duos with me once in a while He doesn t care about this game enough to cheat and he s not that kind of guy So how are they addressing the cheating issue  They re banning everyone left and right who gets reported by some salty player Most Overrated Game Of The YearUPDATE  They just made the report option more detailed with more options DOESN T HELP I just played a game where it was down to 3 people I try and headshot a guy proning with a Kar98 missed the head hit his body guy turns around switches HIS Kar98 to M416 shoots without aiming in mid air towards the sky his bullets  SOMEHOW  hit me and I m dead I m sorry but addressing the cheating issue is not putting in more options to report for FIGURE IT OUT cause it ain t workin,negative
Not bad game I like this game and i play it a lot but i wish it had better optimization I enjoy the game and thank god i havent met with any cheaters but the optimization is really not the best I have many settings on low   very low to not that fps drops or frames are late Bluehole you made an awesome game and you can make it better and you know how to,positive
overated,negative
Much fun much guns much rage and much pans1110Logic,positive
After 10It s totally playable now still expecting some more updates but it runs well Worth to buyBefore 10Optimization is strongly needed for this gameI would recommend at least an 1050 Ti to play on low with okayish performanceThe gameplay is really good though Fun alone more fun in a team There are never two match that plays out the sameThe sounds I find really good in this game you can rely on what you hearThe weapon handling is good too and the controls are in general plays as you would expect itAfter all I would say it s worth it s 30 price in the current state because of the fun gameplay and the crates high selling price but if it remains unoptimized after release I wouldn t say that it s worth 60 for sure,positive

played thru early access and it was crappy but now it is more stable and pretty funi guess my only gripe is that updates and maps are still minimal but at least game play is for the most part ok and not as laggy and choppy like it use to be also you need to BUY A KEY to open one of those special loot boxesGTFO lol,positive

Full of bugs hackers and lag with devs spending time making pointless additions such as new maps and guns instead of fixing what s in front of them,negative
Fun game but its probably just a fad,positive

Game of the year  more like joke of the year  it the most laggy piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ive ever played how did this game generate millions of copies in sales if the net coding is the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iest thing ive ever seen The net coding in this game is worse than any EA game ive ever played Never make this game into any kinds of esports for the sake of the gamming community,negative
Been playing this game since the first month of it s early access release and it s been one of the best experiences I ve had in my 9 years of PC gaming The game developers are committed to pleasing the gaming community who are playing the game with constant updates and implementations of things the community has asked for  ie vaulting lag fixingoptimizationetc This game can be played totally on your own or you can group up with 1 or 3 other players and jump into a 8km x 8km map that is filled with an infinite amount of opportunities and chances to be the last man standing in a all out battle royale betweenwith you and 99 other players The only thing that is a nuissance right now is the amount of hacking but the game is committed to preventing this from continuing with more and more bans each dayGive it a try though There s a reason there s over 12 million copies sold so far,positive
By far one of the Best Games I ve playedI usually get so tired of FPS or 3rd Person Shooters but this game is FRESH and I find myself playing it over and over again  Get it over 2 million have without regreats,positive
This is My best ever played game but the game lags too much and the server is little poorother then this is the best ONE VS ALL game,positive

Fullscreen error is really annoying issue Should fix this prob or at least have a notice,negative

Despite its flaws I still find myself playing this a lot There are performance issues cheaters and missing elements in this game But after a spike earlier this fall the cheating seems to have dissapated and my other two points can still be chalked up to early access If you want a finished product why are you looking at an early access game  Wait for the full release If you think the fun you ll have with friends outweighs the frustrations of early access issues then I would recommend this game This is the case for me and my group of friends most of the time,positive
An awesome game I had my thoughts about it when i buyed it for 30 euro s But after a while you are getting into the game and you are gonna like itAfter all it s for me a well spent 30 euros,positive

I have played about 200 hrs and the game is fun But it would be more fun without the hackers and lag and glichtes It could also help to have a mode where you could join in and play quick rounds it would help in some gun play praticeoverall good game but needs improvements before is released,positive
In the current state of the game the game is broken They d rather add more features instead of improve a broken core gameBesides that the gunplay and movement feels bad games take forever not worth the time investment for all the frustration you will feel  especially at 30 bucks,negative
Pretty Good,positive

PUBG plays well and is fun to play if you won t get upset spending 20 mins getting gear only to die to the enviroment because you didn t get lucky with a vehicle spawn On the game play side it runs smoothly and has good hit reg The general movement feels a bit clunky And tectures lend themselves to rewarding the people who lay down behind a tree the whole game,positive
needs to be optamized,negative
its fun just dont be a bihhh about how you die and just restart again,positive
Gameplay is good but unfinished  unoptimized laggy servers  etc just make it unplayable,negative
Extremely Broken and unplayable at times Shooting your gun is really a 5050 on whether or not it fires while you get mowed down on a buggy inconsistent damage model You must play with friends becuase if you don t you will get teamates who don t speak your language For some odd reason China gets matched in with the US Mexico I can understand and can t blame the game but playing with people from an entirly different continent is unacceptable with high ping in the already bug infested game,negative
Go for it Stay away from motorcycles big towns and chineses hackers,positive
The idea is simple be the king of the hill the last survivor I enjoy the tension of the chase in this game  I find it is a game of hurry up and wait to be killed Collect equipment load weapons move toward non constricting area wait Loot more and repeat 50 60  of the time I never see the person that has killed my character until they loot my remains When I seem have to have the advantage on another player and start the shooting I loose the gunfight about 75  of the time  I enjoy working on a teams that do not killgrief their team members I have now been made aware that the company has aggressively started banning known game cheats  6000 per day The mechanics of the game limit each play through to about 20 minutes by that time a handful of survivors are sardined together to shoot it out My Teamates have made it here a few times without me,positive
Surprising revelation game let s hope it s not just a fad Lots of stuff needs to be polished but the experience is very fun nonetheless   EditBanned for hacking apparently obviously a false positive Their BattleEye system sucks  I play Fortnite as well and no issues there Tons of people are receiving false bans This sucks,negative

I have to change my review to not recommend The game in it s current state has way too many cheaters which use hacks other than aimbot and speed hack i have found myself shooting an enemy and not having a single shot land due to god knows what and having them just look at me and 1 shot me through a lvl 3 helmet and vest Every death cam  i have seen i see people leaningshooting very weird and landing all shots  fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

Very good game but it has its flaws like not ideal servers on avarage you end up or used to end up with 3 cheaters in game no ping lock and very badly done ping compensation but i think fun i had playing this game makes this things bareable,positive
In my opinion this game is relly fun i dont know how long it will last but in my honest opinion its a fun game but can lead to anger and rage but thats normal for a battle royal game I would recommend because I enjoy these games and like to play with friends especially squads It is in beta which is a bit bad since there are optimization issues lag here and there and the occasional glitchy death or explosion but over all it is good to go they have been adding content even though its been a little slow But overall I would recommend this if you dont want to get it now just wait a year or so and it should have more to it hope this helpedBut all this in mind it is in early accese and has some seriouse issues that I cannot reccomend this game until the issues are fixed such as that building dont load properly almost every time the lag is horrible inn the first 10 minutes of rhe game and I stutter and it isnt my pc or my internet So I really like this game but cannot reccomend it as it has issues with optimization and its ability to run wellThis has bee fixed and the game is way better than befor and I can now recommend it to play Vaulting and fixes to both the game and the way it runs has made this a much more appealing and fun game I can now recommend it,positive

The amount of glitches bugs and random bs in this game is incredible It s Early Access so whatever but the company over it has talked of suing other developers implemented paid crates and has done very little to fix any issues The game is poorly optimized and frustrating as hell when you die because a texture didn t load or due to a glitchDon t buy it until it s fully released optimized and the developers start getting their crap together,negative

This game is really fun to play You loot guns vests shoot out your enemies drive cars But until you struggle with a bug Your chances to face a bug in every single game is too damn high because there are millions of bugs glitches To enter a house you will open the door and get in the house Unfortunately not in PUBG Once you pass the door you ll find yourself facing one of the outside walls of that house You saw an enemy and trying to shoot him  F 3 3 3 YOU You cant because there will be lags glitches et and you will find yourself dead I m hearing you screaming is this all   Of course no I forgot the most important part CHEATERS To sum up if you are looking forward to buying this game do not buy it until they fix the game and make it playable,negative
Its kind of a nice game but there still some buggs and there are some guys that play not fair there change things in the config to play like a   hacker ,positive

It will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you throw you keyboard and mouse across the room It will consume your thoughts when you are not playing It will change your life for the better or for  the worseThis game is great as much as it is frustrating Alt F4 will be slammed on many of occasions but you will always come back to it This game is hard but yet so rewarding at the same time You can t hate this game it will always draw you back but you will definatley cry out about the problems the game has or more so that one time you were headshot in a field or hiding out of sight in a room and you are shot from out of nowhereWhen you do well you will tell everyone and post it on social media with screen shots I dont understand how a game can do this but it does As you reach the closer to the end of the round  if you make it your heart rate will begin to race the tension you feel from this game is rediculousIn short This game is greatI would definatly buy this game again but be prepared to get angry and addicted with a bunch of laughs through out your time playing specialy in coop or squad games,positive

Makes a lot of fun just some bugs who can LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  u up real bad A lil more fixin and it is real good brah,positive
Early access game   It s probably going to be LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Well you are right the game has a lot of bugs and glitches and it surely needs a lot of work However the developers are really responding to the community and I am really hyped for the new map and new content  Should I buy it    you ask and I say HELL YEAH especially if you play with friends the game is very enjoying,positive
LOOTING SIMULATOR 2018 MOST REALISTIC LOOTING SIMULATOR,positive
The Battle Royale concept is wonderful  It is my new favorite genre  This game is a hit and miss execution but still worth the experience,positive
Buy this gameDo it do it nowmy hours spent speak for themselves bluehole has been amazing in keeping the game patched and working on it s progress december 12 will be the release of version 10 which will introduce a ton of new contenttotally worth the 30 bucks they ask for,positive
Too much to try explain whats wrong with the gameJust know its VERY tilting hard to get into really glitchy and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE But it is kinda fun,negative
Many hacks Many bugs Much fun,positive
I think they made enough profit so they can fix this game but now they are working on things that are just unecessarry at the moment like  the vaulting systemBut I have to say it is a great game nonetheless,positive
It s a shame that a company that actually knows how to make a game didn t take this idea because the only reason that this game is popular is because of the concept Bluehole simply took the idea and ran with it because it got popular which led to a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of problems Bluehole as a company are dependant LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that will literally kiss anyones LOVE LOVE LOVE  as long as it gets someone else to buy their game  why else would they ban people for killing a gay streamer Shroud is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  anyway and I ll neat his LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you Bluehole are you going to sue me after I smash Shroud s face in real life  Oh wait you cant because you dont even know how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing car suspension works you idiotsPS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s are already overtpopulating and taking all of the world s resouces so how but you stop letting them take our servers too make a special yellow skin server or something,negative
Wow the hackers are so so bad right now  And why report them   It has done nothing this game is a joke now  If we got some feedback on our hacker reports maybe thumbs up,negative
Im inlove in this game still hoping for new updates hehehe,positive
Early Access game that definitely needs some work but all in all delivers on a fun battle royale experience,positive
This game is buggy but its gonna be biggy,positive
Despite the amount of hackers that we re playing I have not encountered any I realize that I don t have many hours but I have recently gotten back into the game lately and I haven t found a single hacker in any of my games The game itself seems more optimized since I last played and I ve nearly doubled my framerates and experience about a fourth of fps drops as I use to I still enjoy the game just as much as I did when I first got it and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have an almost endless amount of fun Every part of this game is amazing Wether it be the hilarious intermissions before a game or the adrenaline rush of killing a player at the end of a game and getting the succulent chicken dinner Everything about this game speaks wonders and I have full respect for the developers and know that they are actually working on making it better than it is today,positive
fun and wait for no hacker in game,positive
madest game,positive
Very nice game  specially for CS GO players,positive
Play a version of the Hunger Games with 99 Chinese people plus you for the sole reward of a chicken dinner,positive
Fun and Thrilling,positive
Game of the year  D,positive
I have nothing to say Just nice game,positive
its just not that fun and its overpriced its a waste of time to long for updates cant help but say this has been one of the worst games my friends have ever told me to play,negative
Unforgiving and satisfying,positive
Fun last until you encounter the plentiful cheaters,positive
A fun repetitive game with a single map and a single goal but always manages to make people keep playing Much more fun when playing with a group of friends1110 until hackers get sent till oblivion,positive

Omg the cheaters lately,negative
Excellent game,positive
It has improved in so many ways since early access For example  Much sharper graphics Added vaulting Added new map Many bug fixes Added many new weapons and vehiclesI only encountered 2 problems  Once while in the red zone the game froze for like 10 seconds but that only once happened and death camera takes way to much time to load Sometimes I had to force exit the game because it took so much time to loadSo all in all  ita still the same game but much better,positive
I have never been more angry at a game Highly recommended,positive
The best and worst team experience ever,positive
Friends game,positive
goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood,positive

It s good game,positive
Needs more cans of beans,positive
Uf Buggy but anyway fun af game  ,positive
It s still pretty fun I don t like loot crates but what can you do ,positive
If you suck at these games then your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed and it will take you like 100 hours to get a win but over all it s a very good game,positive
The game is fun but after a while it gets repetitive If they had more content and vaulting and flying vehicles or maybe even other maps it would keep an interest,positive
Thought nothing of the game until several recommended it Looting and killing for survival alone wasn t enough to keep playing unless that s your thing But sharing that anxiety amongst a group of friends in a race for chicken can deliver countless epic moments The many bugs that frustrate players are to be expected of a game that s not complete but it s a necessary evil to support the success in the future,positive
Awesome game  ,positive
best game eva it does cool i killed a guy i made it to 5 team place in duo  profit,positive
WELCOME TO UGANDA,positive
Region f cking lock China FOR F CKS SAKE,negative
Clearly has some problems I hope the developers keep up to the task because it has the potential to be great But I am loving it as it is,positive
A challenging and rewarding online shooter that will frustrate you but always leave you wanting more,positive
Do you like killing people  Do you like doing it in your underwear  Do you eat chicken for dinner afterwards  Then this game is for you I personally haven t run into any cheater but also I haven t played it for as long as most other so my experience is obviously much smaller,positive
Very fun but still needs much tuning looking forward to playwing this for years,positive
This game is pretty good although glitchy sometimes,positive
I would only recommend this game for people who know what to expect It s buggy poorly optimized unpolished and the servers are incredibly inconsistent  and it will likely never improve The only way to really enjoy the game is to stop giving a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about the fact that you re playing a perpetual alpha build quality game that will regularly get you killed through poor programmingCan be fun with a friend but you ll still spend at least half of the time just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing at each other about who gets the 8x scope,negative
BEST GAMER EVER XD,positive
Network Lag Detected is dooming the game FIX IT ASAP,negative
Best played with friends randos can be pretty fun,positive
I want to love this game because of the way it sucks you in and makes you want to keep playing  Unfortunately the game just sucks  It s never been optimized  Nothing really gets fixed  What have they been doing this whole time ,negative
crazyyyy,positive
The game hnas it s ups and downs but I still find myself coming back to it   one way or another Watching streams thinking about it during work watching highlight videos There s something about Mar  no wait   PUBG,positive
this is one of my best buys for sure but it really is a hard game only wish that they could fix some buggy situations specially when riding a vehicle,positive
This game sucks 1010,positive
In tagalog putang ina neto in english i love it,positive
It is buggy but not as buggy as it used to be Best played with friends 610 If Battle Royale games are your thing you will probably like this game despite the bugs and  slowly but surely deminishing hackers,positive
before you buy this game just be aware that you are overpaying for something that isn t even complete the game has many flaws and many glitches that will cripple your gaming experience right now the only reason why you would buy this game is because you can make your money back with it at the time of writing this comment it seems that the developers focus more on adding new stuff  that is probably broken then trying to fix what we already have if you want a game that is well balanced well optimized and just overall fun this is not the place for you,negative
the game is full of hackers,negative
sound don t work bullets don t work game gets worse with patches somehow LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game it s a cruel mistress,negative
Its a pretty good game,positive
Solid Game lots of fun Still bugs on servers etc but its a working title so to be expected Team play makes this game Side note  Lots of kids hack on this game I was upset with this but then I got a case with a mini skirt in it Made 200cdn off this game so can t be mad at that lol,positive
Stupidly fun,positive
goo,negative
It s a combination of COD and Hunger Games so it ticks a lot of boxes for a lot of people Much better with friends though I must add,positive
When I bought this game I wasn t really sure if it was a good choice but after all it was worth it Some friends also bought the game so it became more and more fun There are some bugs in it but they will be fixed in the future updates,positive
Apperently laggy players from the other side of the world is ok because its racist if you want people to play in their own region Honestly dont most of the time youll die to somebody usually chinese players with like 250ms ping its trash and the dev calls you racist for saying something about it a holes,negative
Just lag dsync   RNG LUL,positive
I think the number of hours played in this game clarifies how good it is,positive
Bad PC  Laggin LOVE LOVE LOVE  doo,positive
It s got issues sure But there s no doubt that this tour de force of a game has gotten me back into a habit I never thought I d find myself in once more  obsessively thinking about how to become better at a game The developers have been very responsive and communicative as they can be and their updates and patches show itEnough has been said about this game now I say  just jump out of the plane at least once and see for yourself if you have what it takes to enjoy a chicken dinner,positive
Great game Very difficult at some points kinda feel like the way the graphics are done up can be a little better but hey my pc isnt the most top notch out there Id give the game 810 Pickles If you are a man of fps shooters or just shooters in general id recommend picking up the gameAlso on a side note the game knocks up to a 9510 when playing with friends and when ya smoking a little bit of the good stuff  ,positive
WELL GAME,positive
Absolute Cracker of a game 1010,positive
Really funny game worth the money for sure,positive
One of the few games that i ve spended money on and i would happily buy again if neededThe tension before the fight is insane Every single moment of the game is memorable never before i ve felt this wayIf you are trying to find some game to marry this one is a dream come true,positive
Excellent looting simulator,positive
Don t worry about the mixed reviews this game is getting most of them are about Bluehole adding microtransactions while they said they wouldn t until after full release The game is actually really fun and the thrill of getting that chicken dinner is one of the best things ever,positive
This game is very very fun  D,positive

gud gejma,positive
This game s great It can take a while to get good at and can be extremely frustrating at times but that feeling on winning a game never gets old You ll start out dropping and dying a lot it ll be frustrating as hell but eventually you ll learn how to fight and starting winning duels Then you ll start winning games then you add more numbers to you kill count per win it never ends the hackers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  tho,positive
One of the most fun co operative games I ve ever played  Fun to search and look for great loot and the shrinking death shield forces you into combat one way or another  Everyone starts with nothing and games are usually shorter than an hour  Can be quite the adrenaline rush,positive
It s a good game BUT NEEDS to be polished up very very well to be a AAA game 10 Is coming out soon hope that fixes the Desync and Lag in the game  I dont think it will Hope they patch the circles so it is less RNG you can have a amazing game and die bc you have to move across a open field to the one guy that got a RNG Circle Last is that the Devs needs to listen to the community who want the core game to run right before they go into useless LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like vaulting ,positive
just a pain,negative
Dope as hell only issue would be the optimization but the gameplay is so simple and thrilling that I can overlook it,positive
Best pvp evahhhhhhh,positive

Since it s been a while after a lot of problems has been fix but the game is still as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up as it isLets just say that  unless for enjoyment purposes   DON T  Like actually don t purchase this gameBugs  Cheaters  Server LagHonestly  for a FPS game  it is definitely obvious that those 2 are going to appear cause no game is perfect duh The cheaters is honestly  100  digusting and blatantly cheating without even trying to conceal the fact that they are using third party software to assist in their matches Bugs are just either hilarious or pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up  finally after plenty months of waiting for their fix  for the weapon s scope bug It is finally fix as of today My friend and I submit a ticket and all they did was just copy and paste the replies both back to us The problem was there for quite some time  the amount of time they took just to address the issue was LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing long I did not wanted to submit a ticket as i thought they would at least paid a bit of attention to the forum  relating to the weapon s sights bug but  nope In the replies were   They did not see a lot of people posting about the problem in the forum   So i took a break from this almost good game to play FORTNITE   I didn t play it  but you know their game system is so much more better anyway Recent server lag was horrible  rubber band has cause like almost most of the death in my matches   JUST DON T BUY IT  IF YOU DON T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN PLAYING WITH YOUR FRIENDS  PS REALLY DON T LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BUY THIS  ALWAYS HAVING PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SCOPE WTF IS WRONG WITH THEM  Rager Kid but yea LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  them ,negative

Sure the servers can be buggySure maybe once every 20 or 30 games your whole squad gets insta headshot by one guy with an AKM a mile away Sure a door might not open when you tell it to and then you try and open it again only to have it slam in your faceLet s face it the game has problems What most negative reveiws I see seem to forget is the simple fact that PUBG is still Early Access  it s not  supposed  to be perfect yet Give it time and the issues will be addressedI do have to say this game manages to get my heart racing and adrenaline pumping like no other when I have good rounds and don t just sit there dead spectating my friends mopping up Overall absoulutely recommend and it ll only get better as time goes by and bugs are worked out,positive
Good game needs better optimization tho,positive
Great simple and fun  ,positive
fun may not be worth 30 to everyone,positive
If you are a girl BE AWAREYou might get pregnant because all you re gonna do is getting LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed by either the game with glitches and bugs or by a random guy who s shooting you from far away because you can t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing see from where he is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing shootingI like the game 10 outta 10,positive

After 100 hours on this game I think I should make a reviewPros   The gameplay is very satisfying Every kill is very satisfying  Lots of guns to play with There are so many guns in the game  Each game is different So the game doesnt get boring  Very fun with friends if you play with friends this game is so much betterCons Performance  Decent or bad PCs can not run this game at all Needs optimization I think this game is worth getting,positive

This game was promising and highly addictive when it first came out but the developers just don t understand how to code anything It s plagued by desync terrible servers horrible optimization all around   most people just use low graphics to keep a high framerate regardless of hardware Best of all is Brendan Greene won t acknowledge any of it He thinks the game is in such a good spot that they can push it out of early access It still plays better than most online early access games but it s the blind leading the deaf in their dev department Instead of optimizing the game they push new weapons and mapsThere s also no region lock or latency limits so you get Asian players in NA servers and they continually desync and lag all around while hacking and using aimbots That s probably the biggest issue,negative
100  recommend this game By far my most played game on Steam If you have friends that play too then this is even better I knew the game was pre release when I purchesed it in March and since that day I have not regretted the price I paid Constant updates further optamisingadding new features and  you can really tell that the development team care about the community and listen Really looking forward to seeing how this game develops in future monthsyears Must play,positive

If I could give this a thumbs up and a thumbs down at the same time I would,positive
Now that the PUBG team actually has a bigger dev team the updates are rolling out pretty quickly and they re pushing the game in the right direction It was looking a little sketchy for a while with the emphasis on their cosmetics but the game is picking up speed in the right direction again,positive
If you want semi realistic br play this But the fun of the game takes a major nosedive once you start to realize how buggy this game really is I want to like this game because I like the actual mechanics in the game like the cover system leaning bullet drop etc Dying to desync sounds not playing player models not rendering and shots not registering point blank has killed the fun I used to have with the game When everything is running well the game is great but that isnt very often unfortunately,negative
large meme,negative
Most of the reviews for this game aren t about the actual game which is a shame but definitely worth the 30 dollars,positive
Keep going awesome game,positive
1010 Quality game,positive
NNice,positive
This game tends to have problems with bugs and such but the graphics are nice when playing on decent settings and the sound design is good as well I personally find this game to be boring without friends but the style of play is a personal preference,positive
Best loothing and shooting experience yet,positive

Graphics  910Gameplay  9510I recommend this game for a few reasons 1 its graphics are very good and you can choose whatever graphics your computer can run2 The gameplay is awesome regardless of the game is being in early access and is not complete yet3 there are tons of weapons types of gameplays 2 huge maps  right now  11242017won 2 games out of too much   and it was fun the game still have what to imrpove but I think the game worth its money time and skills enjoy,positive
A battle royal game is a great concept This game does it the best And hopefully the updates keep coming Worth buying before the price goes up,positive
Had a lot of fun with my friends what more could i ask for oh yeah Some optimization but it s still fun,positive
Plox give vaulting soon,positive
For the Steam Award but this game is real good enjoying it,positive
Ridiculously awesome having the best online moments of my life in this gameFind the right squad or friends to play with and just stop focusing on the objective laugh your way into the circle and camp in a sh tshack when you realize there s 8 players left and you are down one in a squad match Honestly the best in develpment game I have ever came across I just can t wait for it to enter beta A fantastic idea put in fantastic  on point graphics dynamic and rewarding to be good at,positive
THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME I BOUGHT IT FOR 15 and got 60 WORTHJ OF CLOTHES NOW IM RICH,positive
Itbis awesome,positive
You can acquiesce yourself shut,positive
I don t usually often write game reviews but I will tell you something game is simply amazing funIf you play it with you friends then game is totally terrific but for me it s little boring to play it alone   but hey if you want to grind BP points then solo is way to goThis game is all about 60  luck and 40  skill Aim always helps you but luck factor is damn high here because you never know what is gonna be in the next house what loot and who is gonna be inside  except sound is important   you can hear other player s moves Also second important thing is knowing the map and where to go So if you have good feeling for orientation on the map then this is also a huge plusAlso game currently game has performance issues for now  on my PC FPS can drop easily but my PC isn t very top notch game is not that very fluid for now And I think that game should have at least better looking graph  when you see how game is running not that quite good   but hey nothing is perfect and DEVs are gonna soon release 10 release of the game so if you ask me I think it s gonna be worth I mean I just hope DEVs are gonna make game more fluid for lowermiddle end PCsI recommend this for buying   because this game has proved already that s it is worth of the time for playing Positive things   Good replayability  VERY fun with friends  Current map in early access is pretty good designed  more maps to come  Game is developing pretty fast in early access patches are coming frequently  Grinding BP points  depends of the player but this is something which pulls you forward to play this game moreNegative things   Luck factor  random loot finding other players etc  Graph should look better  Random performance issuesfps drops especially on lowermiddle end PCs,positive
So much fun bugs and all,positive
I Think that this game is very goodbut it have bugsI don t know how Bugs was prducedIf i score the game i ll score 99 pointswhy 1 ponits less  bucause too many people use plugins and violate the rules of the game they re tired hope this plugin can be dealt not like a FPS gameThanks for your gameHope you get better and better,positive
This Game is So Awesome especially when u play with your friend you go to some place loot item and sometimes you die  LOL and sometimes you can survive but really hard to chicken dinner when u play with your friend but its really fun if u play with your friendWhen u play Solo it a bit boring because a lot people only prone n wait    ,positive

Played this weekend s event It s extremely fun but our team finished with 0 points because our own teammates friendly fire killed us the entire game   both of whom yelled in a foreign language the entire time It s honestly a great concept completely ruined by cheating and unsportsmanlike behavior It s pathetic that it is consistently players from Asia but just read all of the other reviews If they won t region lock the game and ban people like that I can find another game to play,negative
It s a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  awesome game but have few cheater So i hope they can solve this problems,positive

A good game with some issues but it gives me issues too,positive
Very fun Improvements keep coming No reason not to play this,positive
I would say dont be misled by the  Mixed  reviews this game has The game is fantasticHowever The amount of hackers in the game need to be dealt with somehow A hard task if any other multiplayer PC FPS is anything to go byThat aside i play as often as i can and like most games this one is enjoyed more with a group of friends you can properly coordinate with I do play a fair bit of Solo games but it feels more lonely as players seem to be less aggressive and hide till that blue circle hitsDont judge it unfairly before you play I didnt really want to play it till my friends convinced me and now i cant get enough,positive
Very Nice game  but needs better optimization,positive
Best Running Simulator of 2017,positive
The short of it the game is way better than I ever expected I ve been aware of the game since it was still an ArmA mod but was hesitant to jump in for a long time because the idea of having to fend for yourself without any teammates in a deathmatch didnt sound too appealing BUt because of its insane popularity I decided to give it a shot and at 20 it wasnt a huge loss It was worth it the game does a really good job of creating tension and emotion in ways very few games can Just know the shooting leans more towards realism than a run n gun like Quake or CoD so dont go in here expecting to be able to go Rambo all over people You have to think about your moves and be smart and be patient This game is not for people with ADHDEven though the game is early access I havent had any issues or major bugs The most frustrating part about the game is getting shot from an unknown position while youre running from house to house  Hit detection also seems to be off at times and despite landing more than half a magazine on someone they somehow live and kill you in one shot I dont know if thats a lattency issue or an in game bug but it seems to happen from time to time,positive
Unfinished unpolished under construction and yet the most played game of all time in it s category and rules master of Steam this year I have big hope for this game as every new session is unique in it s own way but there are way too many downs to make me say it s actually a good game,positive
Still waiting for a good optimization for my old patato pc Still a good addictive game,positive

Great Game Never any issuses for me as far as bugs Ireally love this game its a mix of luck and skill which is great My only issuse is the amount of hackers its not every game or even every other game but they are there i really hope that the dev will start cracking down soon,positive
I bought this game one week ago and expected to get bored of it but now I can t stop playing it PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a great game to play with friends and alone  it s better with friends you will always see reviews complaining about hackers but I have not seen any so far This game is too good and popular to still be in early access but there s still so much more that can be added to the game,positive
For some reason this game doesn t play at all like any other shooter and I hate it Reguardless it s a nice game,positive
Good game much better than that fortnite LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  However Please do updates that improve the qaulity of life instead of updates that add content I get you wanna keep people intrested but I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that we perfer a game that runs well and that has little to no bugs than one we LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  loads of content,positive

this will totally eat ur life,positive
Why would someone even play this garbage Too unoptimized and very laggyI guess ill go back playing Nekopara series,negative
i know i dont really have that much time on the game but heres what i can tell you The community is funny but in a dark racist sort of way the gameplay is almost like a horror game for some reason like when you think you hear footsteps outside or get suprised by a shotgun in a room you though was clear nice character customization and plenty of accesories for your guy like the 1 thousand dollar school girl outfits you can find on the market Not as much bugs as you would expect at the time this is still in early develpoment but the vehicles are something to work on Overall no regrets so far on this game,positive
Good fun stressful and awesome game  D pls update for optimization for low end pc and ban all hacker  ,positive
Fix bug please,positive
So much hack and so much lag  ,positive

This game is good game when you are able to play it legitimitelyPlay this game if you want to spend hundreds of hours improving your skill just to be crossmaped by some chinese hackers that are aiming in the sky while using god mode Did i mention that they are able to aim hack through buildings The oceania server is populated with more asians that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing australians etc almost every ching chong either is hacking or has 10000 ms ping Implement region lock It is not racist if 90  or more of the hackers are asian it is fact nothing elseI will keep this a thumbs down until they either purge the asians or implement region lockBlueballs entertainment are a bunch of money LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s and don t care about how the player community feel and their experience They put more effort into the advertising and sales departments than LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game development,negative

Driving over people has never been more fun,positive
This is a terrible game The concept had so much promise and yet it is so technically bad it s laughable the desync at the beggining of the game is poor The close reange combat is a joke I would say this is worse than an EA title in terms of quality battlefront had a better alpha than this game by leaps and bounds Screw this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game It s full of hackers too btw,negative
This game is doing an excellent job of finally getting updates out that people need for this game I have a lot of time playing this game and enjoying the open enviornment and espeically the team style gameplaySolo team play is good If you are on a computer that can handle it better SeriouslyOnly downfalls of this game is that the optimization is till up and down and I would rather have that updated for the goodness of the game especially when walking over loot boxes of dead players and over loot on the ground It freezes people even on computers with high graphics,positive
keep improving this game better than expected,positive
Never like that much a game that I am that bad at it,positive

Game blows fun at first then you really learn what it has to offer and when you do you d like a refund but no you ve played to much now your stuck with a game you dont even want to play so you go play fortnite and guess what same LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  different look if i was all of you id wait or invest your time in something you d enjoy cause trust me both PUBG and fortnite are a dieing breed of game clinging onto whats left for there companys to get out of our pockets DO NOT BUY you ll regret it,negative
I have played this game for a reasonable amount of time At first it was fun but as the cheating got worse and worse it started to make me dislike it more and more I know they have tried very hard to fix that problem but it is still very frequent in this game I can put up with the glitching  which has improved alot but the constant cheating in every other game I am in gets irritating Do not waste your 30 bucks and if you want a fun game that is battle royal style with a spin on it just get fortnite Its free and yes there is cheaters there too but to be honest I havent noticed it nearly as much as on here So I would rather play with cheaters on a game that is free and not nearly as glitchy then on a game I pay for It does not seem that that they can keep a handle on the hackers on this game Maybe just a simple update that notifies you if a cheater you have reported has been banned or even better a video clip of them getting the ban would be amazing but something to show your players that you are doing something about them Other then YOU telling us you did and we are still seeing them all in there Until then peace out PUBG,negative

Was it badly optimised early on  Yes Were the servers lagging  Absolutely Will it happen in the future  MaybeYet the duo gameplay is so much fun you come back to it whenever one of your mates agrees to play The stratigic aspect filled with RNG looting and contesting air drops makes it a delight to play in pairs Other than that squads and solo games are always there for you Winning in each mode brings a pleasent feeling of fulfillment,positive
An enjoyable game,positive
You re always on the edge,positive
This game is fun because you can do sick motorcycle flips and then proceed to die via frying pan,positive

This game has some great moments like pulling off that longshot or your first win but it s optimization needs improvements Gameplay is fun tense but fun and if you re a fan of games like arma where you need to think first then it s a good choice But and there is a but i would wait for the december patch before picking it up as it will supposedly optimize it better take out bugs and is adding more features 710 at the moment,positive
Its a rare specimen we have on our hands here An early access title that is not only out soon but is actually good which is not something you can say about 99  of games that come out of the depths of hell that is early access,positive
Best Survival Game Ever,positive

This game might be fun if you have friends to play it with but it s just not worth 30 It s not an original concept the game is very buggy and frequently crashes most games you just wander around the map trying to find stuff for 20 30 minutes only to be shot by someone you can t see there s microtransactions and the devs ban people if streamers want them banned,negative
Hey look An early access game that is actually fun I wonder what it s gonna be like when it releases in a decade,positive

People seem to be giving this game alot of hate but they need to realize that its still in Early Access The game has incredible potential its one of the most thrilling and blood pumping games i have ever played But PLAYERUNKNOWNS S Battlegrounds is hindered by poor performance and server desync In the test servers for the upcoming 10 update these issues have been almost completely fixed so the devs definantly care about their game,positive

The other reviews say  oh hackers hackers  but they dont even think that the system requirments are wrong I have 8GB of RAM  Minimum 6gb and recomended is 8GB and the game crashes because of lack of ram Dont even try this game if you dont have a good pc The game worked for some time but now it doesn t work anymore Until this game isn t out of early access don t buy it,negative
Bad optimisation and Chinese people teamkilling hacking and abusing high ping in their favour from joining servers they shouldn t be in Since the game favours people with higher ping you can see how this is a problem and you can understand why the Chinese are joining servers that would purposely give them this advantageJust as a bit of help to visualise how often these problems occur almost half of the entire playerbase on this game is from China Food for thought,negative
Just Dont get killed in 5 min,positive
A very good game still need to have TONS of bugs fixed optimization is also a big problem so are the servers and MANY other things but you could still put hundreds of hrs in it if you wantedOverall 710,positive

i recommend this game BUT if you are expecting an esport out and dont buy thing game if you live in oceania and or na because i heard there are alot of chinese cheaters in this game and i havent seen one or played with one myself but it doesnt mean that it wouldnt heppned or it heppend and i didnt notice itin israel  middleeast and europe there is not a big problem with cheaters and this game wouldnt stay populer for more then 1 year so i afraid it would be like rocket league over all its very fun and overclocked my bloodflow to over 9000 btw if youre buying this game buy it with vpn for israel because it 25 in shekels,positive
Dropped in as a naked got killed by a pan 1010 would play again,positive

Tactical game with a pretty steep learning curve A few bugs and glitches here and there but it i mean is early access Solo can get boring but there s always team modes I also only recommend this game if you have good specs  i5 at least and 10 series graphics from NVIDIA My specs  Intel i7 7700kGTX 1060 6GB with Max Q design16 GB Corsair Vengeance RamAnyway I definitely recommend this game Really fun and it makes your palms sweat and your body to shake  it ll keep you in suspense especially in late game  20 15 people leftGreat Christmas gift,positive
Not to be racist or anything but if i die to another  xiang_lou_chi_zui  in the NA server im uninstalling and im gonna be coming for that refund valve,positive

they tried making a shooter and made matrix the game,positive
Incredibly fun and addictive At the same time currently people who have no sense of fair play are ruining the game for everyone I give it a current luke warm recommendation but until Bluehole takes measures to curb the rampant cheating this game is on a downward slope So much potential Please fix the problems,positive

gREAT,positive
Best shooter battle royale game The only problem is that the game is not optimized,positive
Needs some work This game can be fun but it just feels like cod or battlefield games that have been around for years My biggest issue is rendering and lag which according to my research has been an issue for quite some time Anything farther than a few yards looks like playdough and player models look like black cubes Tons of instances of no reg hits once stood point blank shooting a guy in the head and the server said I was missing ever shot I would recommend the game if the devs spent more time fixing bugs instead of charging people for loot boxes,negative
This game is nothing but a washed up has been in 2018 any nothing really significant was inproved since the game was out  No reasons to get me back playing for even just a bit,negative

Writing this after 34 hours of playtime The game is pretty fun to play I have yet to encounter a hacker as so many reviewers say keep in mind I play on EU servers The performance is honestly not as bad as some are painting it to be It could definetely be much much better which it will be  I ve tried the 10 test servers but even as is it s not that bad I play on low settings on a GTX 1060 with i7 2600k  oc ed to 43 with 8 gigs of RAM and the FPS is generally above 60 with some drops to 30 40s in some areas To sum it up  great game don t get it if you re easily frustated tho,positive

I hate the hype train I hate things that the  unwashed masses  like I hated ET I hated Titanic I hate vaping But I have to say I actually like this game that everyone  and I do mean everyone  likes This game is more than a  hunger games  clone It s more than a shoot em up It s more than a platform for you to be featured on as this week s  Awesome Death  on some lame streamers channel It s a thrill ride and it will litterally make you sweat and shake You really feel the adrenaline pump and you know that you are in a contest like no other even though it s a game I haven t seen a game elicit a reaction so vicseral in me for a long time This is already an instant classic and it s in open BetaDo yourself a favor and get this game,positive
More bugs more fun,positive
Good chill out game,positive
hoppe the update can help the game otherwise blast game with great tension,positive
Great fun game still in early access and adding loads of new content best battle royal game i have played and i enjoy the PvP in this as its easy to pick up  ,positive
you will rage alot,positive
lovely game,positive
Every kill is skill every death is hackers,positive
A very addicting gamelove every second of it,positive
Interesting,positive
Simply the best king of the hill game out there and one of the few which will likely leave early access  Solid graphics loot system gunplay movement vehicles etc It is just leagues above the competition right now with the possible exception of Fortnite if you like cartoony graphics and craftingVery different experiences depending on 3rd person or first person Furthermore solo duo   squad modes also changes the approachtactics a lot Just remember that winning is about staying alive more than getting killsNB  High Spec Computer is needed to play,positive

Maybe the developers should actually FIX the game before doing things like moving it to mobile,negative
The Code is probably very bad GTX 960 is on a 99  load in all very low settings But even though its quite fun with buddies,positive
Gucci funny game but I think it s little bit overrated and hyped It s so f ckin  rng but basically it s what is that game about  D  l mean lootzone and Just don t talk about optimization,positive
A reminder of how the lack of good games allows for mediocracy to raise to the top,positive
ye its pretty good,positive
Wish i didnt die on the first fight after looting for 20 mins and running from the circle for 10 mins,positive
The amount adrenaline I used to get when I first started playing this game was just astounding It s just so exciting to play not knowing when someone is gonna pop out from behind a tree and start shooting at you or whether you or your enemy is going to pick up the rifle just as you both land This being said the game has quite a few glitches and bugs but that can be mostly forgiven since it s early access Bluehole  are working on sorting out the game s problems and it s only getting better by the week,positive
this game is absolutely trash fortnite is better,negative
I keep diving out of a plane to my death and I like it,positive
Speed the movie but its a game stand still and you die,positive
One of the most intense games I have played its right now a big mess with hackersBut on the other side when it gets fixed I think this would be a real fun and enjoyable game,positive
Since the day of realease of PUBG I have been playing it quite a bit Some days you want to kiss the game and some days you want to uninstall it becuase of some crack LOVE LOVE LOVE  shot from another player However you just can t leave the game you want that adrenaline pumping when you go through a town through the woods or even turning around a corner at the edge of a wall This game just gives you that the need to win because its the best feeling to get that  Chicken Dinner  Also the devs are doing their best by being on top of the cheaters in the game content for the game and basically making sure their servers don t crash and burnWhat I m trying to say here is if you want a game that has descent mechanics adrenaline rush and the devs haven t left it to the side of the curb Then this is the game for you,positive

Good concept but the servers suck Low quality servers poor bullet registration heavy lag at start of game due which game ends for some people before it even started as they are not able to pick up guns right infront of them I have seen people killing me in less than a second even when I have already emptied my magzine on them and this happend many times in a point blank rangeAnother thing with the sucky servers my other applications are running fine youtube is running fine pings to other servers running fine and this game stucks and says  Network Lag  and my 20min hard work is wasted This even happened once when I was in the last 2 guys remainingSo guys this game will only increase ur frustration and stress levelServers suck too bad,negative
Pretty boring Hard to see enemies,negative
Except for the hackers I think its a great concept and a great game in the making,positive
Wonderfull game also little bit stressfull when you are last person With friends is always nice and in squad you need full suqad or you rish loosing Hopefully game will fix all the glitches in futre and I will be able to play game better,positive

A good game Hard work on it can be seen with every update Let s hope that it will get better and better,positive
It  just like every other game except for MGS4 Windwaker and Witcher 3 has its faults It has the occasional bug just like every other game However PUBG has almost 4 times the player base of the second most played game on steam It s also half the price of typical AAA games This game will make you angry it will make you question your skill But when the dust settles and you acquire your first chicken dinner you will be hooked From the  CHINA NUMBA 1  chants in the lobby the desperate fear fueled looting at the beginning of matches the long drawn out sprints to the circle through fire flame and randomly honking vehicles this game will grab you by your hairless undeveloped balls and refuse to let go Somewhere in this world there is someone who despises and refuses to play this game Maybe he hates the hype maybe he was wronged by the devs or by the game at some point I don t care I adore this game for everything it is If I could care any less about what someone had to say negatively about this game I d likely not be far off from deepthroating a 12 gauge and playing footsy with the trigger 95 out of 10 give me the new map and I ll give you the other 5 points  3,positive
I ve got this game couple of days after its release on early access 7 months later I am still playing it the mostWith the constant updating and additions this game is worth every penny and more I even got more money selling the boxes from this game then the money I spent on itThis is the best Battle Royal and best  fightingshooting  game there is out there,positive
This game is really fun to play and exciting PUBG has a great potential to be one of the best games out there but it still needs optimization Take note that this game is in Early Access so expect a lot of bugs and crap along the way For the meantime let us enjoy having our chicken dinner,positive
The wrong ban on PUBG I didn t use any hacking software but I was prohibited by mistake please help me to lift the banAlthough I play a little recently but I still like the gameA few days ago I and my friends play state is good a lot of fun But don t know why I was bannedI still want to play with friends I hope you can help methank you,negative

This game is just getting bettter and better If you have a mid to high end PC this game is perfect for youThe only problem i can think of about this game is the poor optimization however it does keep on getting better and better The developers love this game and so do I If you are looking for a game to grind hours into or even just to play with your friends every now and then its great It comes at a great price compared to other titlesFurthermore it is fuly releasing later this year so will be even better with the implementation of mantling as well as possibly the new map,positive

It is not the best game But I have the fun with my friends,positive
I honestly see why no one can dislike this game Sure it s not for some people but the reasons people say its a bad game are just stupid 1 Of course there will be hackers Any highly successful game will have them The devs are always working on this issue Out of the time I have played I haven t run into any hackers2 Sure there is some lag but again games like couter strike have on some occasions laggy servers We have to remember the game has not fully launched yet If you want a completely perfect game buy it after launch3 Gameplay The gameplay is all but boring Some games you get killed in the first 3 minutes Some games you win No matter which of these happen to you the adreniline pumps every second you jump off that plane,positive

Ok so basically I ve played enough matches to know what s going onBit of a learning curve for the survival shooter battle arena newbie but if you drop high pop first 20 games you ll get the hang of it faster because you re going to have to down a crapton of peepsYou CAN make top 10 easily if you plan ahead and move stealthily I ve found that if you run around guns blazing you get downed hella fast It s also possible to reach Top 10 without getting kills but it s kind of difficultSolid time if you play with friends also enemy death voice is hilarious but rare afAs it is now I mean it s not bad but I don t know if it s worth 30 pesos my dudeThere are no sales for PUBG as far as I m aware so if you plan to get PUBG make sure you get the most out of it I got my fun get yoursDas it later Edit To address other concerns yes there are cheatersYes the game is repetitive but if it gets repetitive Play a different game lmao You can make the same excuse for any other titleAlso I ve noticed weird CPU issues with this game specifically my CPU jumps to 100  and sometimes when you join a match you can get stuck on the loading screen but that s not as common as there have been patches,positive

1 You can get over 15 hit points enough to down and it won t down 2 You can have a shotgun and shoot someone with no vest no helmet or anything and it won t down or kill them even though it is enough to blow you arm head or leg off in real life and 3 you can shoot someone first and hit them more than they hit you and you die like WTF  I may keep coming back to the game but it s like the game is asking me to play fortnite or H1Z1 or a different battle royal game,negative

The game runs well on my system Appart from occasional frame drops and buildings taking their time to render in on my first match it stays at a constant 60fps I ve only had one experience with a hacker and while I agree that hackers are a problem you shouldn t negatively review the game just because of other players although they do kind of ruin the experience I guess idk Anyway they have introcuded new anti cheat meaures so this should hopefully help The gameplay if crazy fun It is hectic fast paced as well as slow  most of the time actually and some games you will go super well others you will just spend 40 minutes looting just to get domed in the head Most of the time if you are looking for a fight you can find one Anyway the game is still in Early Access so it should not be judged as harshly as it has been it certainly isn t perfect and most definatelly isn t game of the year worthy but it dosn t deserve to have mixed reviews as it isn t pay to win and the devs have done a good job keeping the lootboxes strictly cosmetic Should be rated positive at the very least well thats my opinion anyway,positive
This games a 1010 who wouldnt play this amazing piece of art,positive

Unexpected best game to be Always played by million people AwesomePls update to optimized for low spec PC,positive
Many bugs and glitches Most of these will be fixed in the 10 patch but as of right now it s riddled with hackers and game breaking bugs It still brings an enjoyable experience though but only if you have the right specs The minimum requirements for pubg at the moment is basically a lie  Though I played on the Test Servers and my game ran fine Shows that Bluehole is at least trying to optimize the game for those that don t have good PCs My specs are as shown   8gb RamGTX 670Windows 81 I 3   I m not really sure on this one Too lazy to check rn lolThis game is especially entertaining with friends but can also be a blast playing solo In all honesty it s not ready to be released as a full game just yet It has MANY bugs and glitches that can ruin experiences and kill a players motivation to keep playing It s really not a bad game for 30 and I highly recommend everyone to at least give it a try Keep in mind that this game is still in early access but if you want to get a better feel for what the game will be like when it s fully released download the test server,positive
The best game in the battle royale genre Anyone who disagrees has either never played it or they re a console peasant,positive

Fix the bugs before you add new guns or maps The gameplay when it works in fantastic but the bugs and lack of optimization really hurt the game,positive
The game is addictive but the game is not optimized even good pc cant play it over 60fps what the hell devs doing  the game not fully optimize and they try to create another game ,positive

Been playing Battle Royale type games since PU s mod on Arma Games everything I could have imagined and more After getting tired of playing on Arma because of how the engine was outdated And also playing other survival games on the side Yup even played H1Z1 KOTK which of course PU was contracted to make with them and even then the game was pretty fun but wow When PU was able to put this game out with no limtations because its no longer a mod but a Standalone game of the dream he wanted for this game to be I am freaking Amazed and Addicted to this game It s sooo good the gun play is sooooooooo good I cannot wait till they make this game modable so we can see what people can do with this game and change it into something they would want out of a game I personally would love this game to be moded into some kind of base build survival game That s what i want but The game on its own is truly a great action keep my heart and adrenaline pumping type of game,positive

There s a lot of hackers by a lot i mean you basically meet one every 3 5 game But i ll still give it a thumbs up the developers are doing their best to optimize and make the game more funTo those who complain about bugs and hackers  Stop grinding and give the developers some time you still play it because you know its the best among its genre,positive
fortnite for rich people,positive
Honestly speaking yes this game has glitches Yes it can be frustrating Yes there are hackers But I feel that even with all these flaws and problems this game was fun My personal opinion is that if you spend at least an equal amount of time on the game  happily as you did buying it it was worth it That s like 1 for every hour you played it Not too shabby,positive

 09042018 PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS or PUBG as it is commonly called is a game that sets out to provide the most complete and enjoyable battle royal experience As of writing this review I have over 420  haha hours of recorded gameplay in other words I know my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE I m going to start off by saying that I love PUBG and that I believe anyone interested  with a decent pc should buy it Though for most people winning doesn t come easy so you re going to need to put in a lot of time and effort to get that chicken dinnerSince I purchased the game back in July of 2017 the dev team at PUBG Corporation have provided a steady stream of updates These have varied in scale some adding new weapons vehicles customization options and more recently a new map The map in question is a desert themed landscape known as Miramar In my opinion it isn t that good compared to the original but it still manages to provide a change of gameplay from Erangel which has been enjoyed by many players since the game s alphaI however do have two major issues with the game one of these being the optimization across low end PCs Even though I have good pc running this game used to be quite a struggle I m glad to say that this hasn t been much of an issue after the 10 update I am now able to run the game at ultra settings without sacrificing framerate although your mileage may vary The second and arguably more important issue would be the common presence of foreign players that tend to have unreasonably high ping this creates a balance issue for everyone else to make this worse many of these foreign players are modding the game which even furthers the imbalance and can ruin the experience for everyoneEven with the poor optimization across low end machines and potentially rage inducing server issues PUBG is a game that almost anyone can enjoy and for this reason along with many others like the unique gameplay situations that offer fantastic opportunities for teamwork and the continued support of the developers I recommend this game710,positive
I really love the game but the developers need to take care of the cheaters specially in sea and asia server stupid as chinese then they need to optimise the game more because of the fps problem even if u have a good pc  _ ,positive
Before my first win i had dreams of winning and now that I ve won it still haunts everything that I do I can t see red smoke without running Horns scare me and I can t look at my cast iron pan the same way Don t get me started about when i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the bed,positive

Run Run Run No Time For Strategy or LootingThe game has been quirky since the day I bought it Then we got some updates that improved little things over time 10 Brought the most fixes with update 9 being great and bringing the ability to spectate after you die In between we had updates just adding more useless clothes and gun skins with the really good ones being behind a paywall mostly Then we got the 10 update yesterday I was so excited after looking at the notes and seeing no more stupid useless clothing items will be in house to accidentally pick up and slow you down when trying to get a gun They also decided to tweak the blue zone and completely ruin game play in my opinion Now you are constantly on the move trying not to get hit and killed by the blue zone since now not only does it move faster the first three circles speed wise but you have less time in between the old circle and the new circle     I understand you are trying to make the game play encounters happen more often however earlier in a game I got a kill and circle hit me right as I killed the person I went to loot them I got the loot and started running I used 4 first aids trying to get to next circle and still died outside of circle To me that just makes the game basically unplayable Please fix the game,negative
Great game to play with friends and test your skills Although this game sucks because there is no Anti Cheat system which results in most games and deaths by cheaters,negative
You can see cheating players at everywhere in this game Even in a wild toilet youcan meet a LYB,negative
A One Hundred Player  Last man standing  First and Third Person shooter in which you are dropped onto a large map to gather weapons ammo armour and other supplies in order to survive against your competition Very enjoyable in short play sessions  matches typically go for around 30 minutes and especially while playing with friends The concept itself is repetitive but the size of the map and the inability to guess where another player might be keep things tense and dynamicThe game is prone to bugs and poor optimisation  though this isn t a problem for myself personally but development continues steadily and issues are gradually being addressed You may want to wait for the official release,positive
Love this game but lately desync has been an issue,positive

Concept is fun but needs further optimisation I understand a game like this will never run well considering the size of the map and the amount of players but I feel like it could be a lot better Shame it doesn t support Vulkan Still a decent purchase overall it s probably more fun to play it with friends,positive
This game has so much potential but all the stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bugs are annoying as hell Along with the stupid updates i m starting to not want to play this game Heres a list of things why you shouldnt buy this game1 You can get stuck in some random corner and just die to the blue zone2 You can randomly hit invisible walls with vehicles3 Motorcylce LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing flip into the for no reasonm4 Patches are 8 10 GB5 Game shuts down for FOUR HOURS DURING PRIME TIME GAMES IN NA Which is so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stupid because they have servers per region LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing update them accordingly6 Game has issues loading This can range from guns not spawning on my client until later to not loading into game until i jumped off the plane and drowned  or killed by a random player7 Fortnite is free and at this point looks more fun to playSo LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stupid for the price you have to pay,negative

Much improved and still the king of Battle Royale,positive
PUBG is the best shooter I ve played in a long while Partialy because of its realistic gun work with hard to aim shots partialy because of its strategical enviroment in which you don t have to memorize the map and be the god of reflex in order to get kills It s both a mental and skill game combined The best player at shooting may lose in the first minute of game because he jumped at a crowded area and meanwhile the average weekend player may finish in top 10 because of good decision making when movingGreat game no other is able to deliver the same package yet,positive
I deleted this about a mounth ago and i got it agion and now it just black screens every time i launch it,negative

I spent half an hour in main menu fixing 3 different bugs because it was literally impossible to enter a game In game I have 50 FPS when I turn down the resolution by half I can play all the AAA titles fine but for some reason this game demands more Guess the graphics are just so revolutionary Driving with any of the cars in game is more dangerous than playing russian roulette Everything that can possibly glitch in a videogame glitches here You can bet on it The things that you thought would never glitch in any game will definetly glitch in this game There are more bugs in this game than there are in most early alpha games but this one is full release This game has made me stronger as a person My biceps is 3x bigger from punching my walls and keyboards I batteled alcoholism and cancer both due to this game and won Definetly recommend 1010 Esports ready,positive

This game is a lot of funIt s probably one of the most entertaining and addicting games I ve played all year As with any early access game there are going to be issues The issues I ve encountered frequently in PUBG  Mostly lag sync and server crashing issues don t occur enough to make the overall experience less enjoyable As of this review I ve played a pretty good amount of PUBG and I ve maybe experienced 2 or 3 hackers in all the games I ve ever played It s frustrating to lose to a hacker but that doesn t happen nearly as frequently to me or my friend group as it appears to occur to others Are there issues with the game  Absolutely This game needs a LOT of work done to resolve the network issues and sync lag However the game is a ton of fun to play and all the issues I ve experienced really don t take away from the general enjoyable experience  at least in my opinion I think it s worth playing,positive
Best game ever Kappa XD,positive

Playerunknowns Battlegrounds is officially a phenomenon What began as a quiet also ran in the mold of Day Z and H1Z1 has blossomed into one of the most played most streamed games of the year For such an unassuming simple in concept game PUBG has achieved dizzying heights of popularity and success So whats its secret  How does a passion project from a humble Scottish modder turned developer explode into an international sensation For starters and most importantly PUBG is  nearly as fun to watch as is it to play Its the kind of brutal entertainment weve always associated with video games  and shooters in particular blended with the morbid The Most Dangerous Game pleasure of watching human beings relentlessly hunt each other But its not just a Battle Royale Hunger Games sort of appeal that PUBG traffics in though those influences are obvious More so than either of those properties PUBG relies on a sense of empathetic desperation,positive

Good game Hackers or not the mentality should always be to surpass them at some point with lots of practice One shouldn t always rage for only 5 min of play when the  Play  button is a click away after dying Just chill and keep trying Crying and raging on an  Early Access Game  is for babies IMHO,positive

Great game but so many bugs that needs fixing,positive
There s way too many China hackers playing the game Not only does it destroy the game it diminishes the fairness in the game making the game unpleasant for anyone else who aren t hacking  Not everyone from China are hackers Stop being so critical about others of different nationality  It might seem that I don t care but actually yeah I don t  You may argue that not all China players are hackers but what I know is all hackers are from China On top of that most boosting services are targeted towards the Chinese players more specifically those in China as there is a higher percentage of players ordering boosting services from China Seeing from the many bad reviews about the game I can see the game is actually dying so please do something about the game to revive it such as maybe even improving the stability of the game and reducing the lag in the game I truly hope for the developers to take serious consideration into my review and improve the game for the community,negative

This game is amazing The gunfights are very satisfying and seem very realistic All the different attachments and scopes you can put on guns is an aspect many games don t have However the price is perhaps a little too high maybe it would be better at 15   20 There would definitely be more players if the price was lower,positive

EARLY ACCESSIf you have 30 to blow and you re really interested in playing then I d recommend but if you can wait then I would suggest waiting for the full release in December It s overall a good game at its core but it suffers bad optimization clunky FPS mechanics and a swarm of cheaters Take my advice and wait until it s released to see what s going on FULL RELEASE    if you can call it that as of update 4I m so disappointed in this game It had so much potential and still has made little to no progress towards an acceptable game especially for one that has generated millions of dollars in revenue It is still clunky still laggy and still plagued by cheaters The developers are money hungry scum that push a 10 release to make more money and hush up the community who have been waiting for an update for over 5 months Congrats developers you added climbing mechanics that are still buggy and unfinished and a new map that in my opinion was poorly designed and much less fun to play than the first I respect the development team and their schedule but not their scummy business practices such as micro transactions to an already overpriced game not to mention them being added in EA I wish this game was good as I really did have fun playing it but with just how unpolished this game is it s more frustrating than fun at the moment For the amount of money that the development team has made it s just sad that the game is still in the state that it is The update system is a joke as well as the servers Bluehole cried about Epic Games releasing Fortnite because they knew that their game was better from the servers to the fluidity and the lack of cheaters If you want to play a game that s better than this one and still in EA go doenload Fortnite The people of steam don t lie it has 50  positive reviews for a reason Avoid this game until it is worth the price tag,negative

The greatest experience of the year possibly of the decade Whether you re playing alone or in a team PUBG just blows you away with its frenetic tactical gameplay Fantastic gameplay striking a perfect balance of fun and complex Winning a match is one of the most rewarding events in gaming Surprisingly stable Ultrawide support  Developers are having a hard time fighting cheaters  Could be more optimized probably will be before the Early Access ends55,positive

Even though the game has its flaws you never want to stop playing the game because you know that next game could be the game where you finally win that chicken dinner or if your have already won a game and you are just a little bit more hungry for another chicken Grab your friends and fight to the death in this amazing last man standing game,positive
I can t seem to get enough of this game It gets me playing for a good amount of time and makes my adrenaline rush at times what more can you ask from a game  Ofc there are bugs since it is in early access but it is definitely playable Oh btw i wrote this review to get a badge  P,positive

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS an Interesting game  I have enough hours to say what i want about this gameNow theres no 5050 button so ill still recommend it I bought this game back in july 2017 played it quiet a lot and can tell that the game feels more different from early access in slight better way The optimization has gone 100  better the game is always in 90 and 100 fps never drops down bellow 60 before when i bought the game i had to play on low just to get that fps on ultra i used to get 50fps not any higher so theres a clear improvement I don t even wanna talk about the vehicles in the game  but the sounds are pretty nice Weapons  They seem balanced i dont even know why they are releasing a weapon balance patch The skins for the weapons is a nice addition don t mind my weapon looking niceCharacter AnimationsVaulting and stuff  Character customization is nicely done enough but it doesn t matter doesnt really have anything to do with the game Animations are pretty good close to being realistic the vaulting is alright but still needs improving The cosmetics are pretty nice i don t mind looking good in the game  DHit registration  Could be much better because half of the time legs register instead of the head  pretty disappointing Servers  I think they are more stable now they don t seem to be having any of surges anymore which is niceUpdates and Content  I like that theres no maintanance at all when they release the updates even though they above 1GB its fine don t have any problems with the space Content itself i think its lacking wouldn t mind seeing more stuff being added to the game Events  That is a very nice addition to the game makes it actually fun playing PUBG with friends especially that you can invite a whole other 7 friends is amazing Wouldn t mind keeping that for normal servers War Mode is an amazing mode to practice something like that mode has a lot of potentual such as a separate small map which would be very coolMaps  Erangel an amazing map original is always the best in my opinion Miramar is not the best in my opinion it feels like the matches last forever in that map The upcoming Codename Savage map has a lot of potentual played the crap of that map its small has already a lot of detail dont really get cucked by the zone because most of the time you are faster than the zone 4 places which are high risk high loot which i like  Anyways this game is worth a try 269930 for this game is a pretty good price and for the content that you get  there are many alternatives to this game such as Fortnite Battle Royale H1Z1 and new Radical Heights My rating for this game is 710 which is not bad but its alright,positive
Amazing game it is really fun to play it I didn t use to like it at first but they i got used to it and started loving the game,positive

Great game with lots of intense moments and keyboard destroying fails I wish FPS didn t make me pick highest performance vs frames as I do enjoy my visuals The people are typical toxic open mic idiots but you are usually free from their gutteral spewing once you jump I enjoyed my time in this game and will likely return but FPS has always been a hotcold genre for me This is a good sweaty palm game if you like a little tension and the feeling of something being at stake,positive

I totally freaking recommend it do NOT listen to the negative reviews the people who wrote those reviews just suck at the game kept dying and got mad this game is very good just for early access and this game is profitable off of crates you can only get a limited amount each week but that is a good thing or else Valve or Bluehole will be dead,positive

This game I ve spent enough time to say that I love it It s got ups and downs in the most extremes I ve noted that nothing for recording or spectating really gives the game the justice it deserves as what this game can be best described as a multiplayer thriller You have no idea where people are and when you do you hunt them and the adrenaline just pumps the game s overall feel when in regards to weaponary are actually amazing and brought a real sense of what guns are like Highly recommend this game Just remember that being 1st place isn t a reasonable goal and be happy that you ve done better than your last round like me I want to get more than 3 kills per round Then I see how far I can go,positive
Is prety god yes,positive
don t buy this game save your money and buy actual fps or play fortnite wait until they finally finish the game there are constant bugs and their  fixes  don t ever address the main issues only dumb stufflike adding emotes that s what we all wanted was emotes,negative
I personally find this game entertaining and worth my money It does have some glitches but that is to be expected when it s in early access,positive
Game is fun,negative
Great game super addictivePerformance is not amazing and content is still limited though this is expected of an early access title,positive

The best overrated game of 2k17 There s something wrong with the industry if this wins any GOTY award but the game is kinda alright though,positive
Battlegrounds is a game that consists of playing both casual   competitive Great for fellowship   sharing your Chicken Dinners Giving you an adrenaline pump as you get closer to the top   heart relieving when you die or win Giving you little to no time to think for your next strategy Exploring areas with hidden items that will be in use or be useless to you A game of luck skill intelligence quick thinking   many more This is the game that makes it fun for all if you are competitive your fun is to win   if you are casual your fun is to laugh with your friends A game that consists of competitive   casual gameplay what a game this is,positive

I highly reccomend this game for people who can run itThis game is a great concept great graphics weapon variety 2 already fun maps and more on the way It s insanely funI got this game 2 months ago and have over 100 hours on it already 16 chicken dinners and I have an all around great time on itMy only issue is region lock They need to region lock china desperetly because they all come to the North American servers and hack 247 And in their event modes when you play with random squads half of them on chinese on the NA servers and don t even speak english,positive
This game has gotten increasingly more frustrating to play The more time that goes by the worse this game gets Don t get me wrong it s fun for screwing around in that s how my friends and I play this game now But now oh boy now Now we get server issues Now we get countless cheaters Now we get crashes and bugs We get crates in random rewards that REQUIRE a 250 key because selling the game isn t enough for them We get stupid weapon skins that nobody asked for They are working on a new map when the first two are still not finished They took out the weather then added a limited time event that boasted that there is weather On top of all of this there is no optimization Have a 15x scope  Have fun looking at all those unrendered textures My thoughts on this game are mixed It s a fun game but should have never left early access Fun to play with friends if you don t want to take the game too seriously but that s about where the plusses end,negative
Game is a big piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but its fun,positive
Hope the game will be a bit more optimized in the future Anyway the game is quite good  ,positive

Great game however the threat of a CS GO crate system is a valid concern,positive
Not bad but this game difficult to win that i play,positive
Money hungry devs kinda ruined this game Spend in game credits to get a crate  which can be anywhere from 2 10 matches to get enough credits to do so and you get a crate you have to buy a key for  Didn t I purchase this game already   I feel like I did I purchased it with real currency My bank account confirmed this Honestly I really wish I hadn t I rarely enjoy an actual match And after watching kill cams it becomes pretty apparent that aiming is really all for show and doesnt actually effect where your bullet goes,negative
i can t believe I wasted my money on this over priced and over hypedbroken piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Hackers every single match its just terrible Download fortnite if you want a battle royale game that isn t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

The amount of times I ve watched the killcams and seen people automatically aim exactly where me and multiple teammates were sat and proceeding to fire with a recoilless fully automatic M16 is uncountable at this pointDon t buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it s literally CS GO in terms of  oh we re trying to crack down on hacking  but are probably designing the workarounds for extra profit and actively update everything BUT the security I mean how hard would it be to have an alogrithm or a few lines of code that say  IF said player is moving at a certain speed or locking on to specific areas THROUGH OBSTRUCTING OBJECTS and continues to do so when firing a weapon with script level accuracy they get a ban and pending review of their gameplay        It s a waste of time and money unless you actively enjoy playing with hackers or using them yourself,negative

Loved this game immensely for the 15 hours I had the opportunity to play it I was banned for cheating after about 15 hours of game play Had 3 kills in 15 hours of game play Contacted steam Bluehole and battleeye to investigate the false flag so far nothing It was funny though my ban came in about 30 seconds AFTER a kill The first kill I had in about 4 hours May have capped a dev or a moderator and they didnt like it Thats my suspect I hope someone sees this so they can investigate and fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because I really did like this game I never played it for stats its not a game you play to get the most kills Its a game you play to get into rediculous situations trying to take out a group with automatic rifles with nothing but a frying pan,negative
I hate pubg servers and chunky movementWant my refund,negative
Make this game NA only on NA servers bc I get qu ed up with ppl who are never NA its once in a blue moon I get a NA player This game is trash bc of that Will change rating when they allow only NA players in NA and Asians only on Asia Servers,negative
If you want to play a good game get the game before v10 comes out,positive
This game has the potential to be an awesome multiplayer game but it needs a lot of attentions from the developersIf you don t encounter with cheaters which is unlikely then you can enjoy some happy hours with your friends,positive

RNG in skill based game without question unoptimized and buggy as all hell they add skins and emotes when they could be taking care of hackers and other problems to make the game better playable devs dont care about the community and are starting to turn into Valve 20The only fun thing to do is to play with friends and the times where you do land on a gun and pop off while slaughtering defenseless people who have fallen victim to RNGesus and end game is pretty fun too I guess  e sports ready btw,negative
Everyone was playing this and I couldnt find it on sale anywhere so I say  why not  After more than 20 landings in less than 30 minutes I was able to kill someone only because he was AFK Love it Will play again and again,positive

Great game Has so fps issues some weird glitches but its definitely worth getting especially with the  new vaulting soon coming in and the new desert map It must be said thought that there are loads of cheaters currently in the game,positive
It s one of the best multiplayer games i ve ever played and probably will I also hope they would region lock China or at least make something to discourage Chinese players from playing in all the other servers it s not that they re all cheaters i ve only encountered very few cheaters actually it s the multiplayer aspect of the game that i m more concerned I m a Filipino and with other Southeast Asians we can communicate pretty well in English while i don t mind playing against Chinese players because i play squad with friends anyway it s when my friends aren t online and i want to play squad with random people that i would like to be able to play and strategize better when we can understand each other In my hundred hours or so of playing PUBG i have only matched squad with another Filipino once and only very few times with english speakersEven when try playing in NA and SA servers it s still full of Chinese playersAnyway all the other reviews here about lag is unfair almost all of them don t include their PC specs and internet speed it s unfair for them to give a bad review when their intel atom procie intel HD integrated GPU and low speed internet can t run the game properly,positive

Ok I ll just edit this review because the game got out of Early Access and I ll be veeeeery short This game is just a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  unoptimized H1Z1 clone with developers going out of their way to ban people for doing as little as honking their cars near a streamer Overrun by Chinese people hackers and now it is  released     eSports ready Just remember that  adding a new map  without even an option to switch from one to another new animations and terrible new weapons instead of optimizing the game finding a newbetter anti cheat system fixing the hitboxes and hitregs doesn t get your game out of early access it just adds new content before getting released and possibly makes it worse  which in this case it did get worse,negative

This game is unforgiving The reason why I still play this game  besides all the hackers bugs trolls and GOD DAMN STUPID RED ZONE is because every situationfight will be different And know Bluehole will be constantly updating this game 3 maps available  so far Fun to play with friends if no friends would not recommend it,positive
plz don t replace the two pistols two SG same weapons  in one place together fix some of the bugs like aiming and hackingI really like this game some additional cars or bites  or bicycles some duel pistols or machine guns  additional guns and landmines or poison gas shurikens kunais   Pthz bro,positive
There s a reason this game has received mixed reviews  It starts out as a fun time and cool concept  That s pretty much it  The hit boxes are garbage  The weapon physics are garbage  The cheating is rampant  The  events  are garbage and poorly done and indicative of a developer that just wants to get people to stfu and keep playing  The report mechanic for cheating and various other issues is also garbage  Not to mention you have to now pay for the  rewards  in order to useopen them  garbage  Also roughly 50  of the time you play you ll be queued and teamed with people you can t even communicate with  Don t waste your money  I try to give every game a fair shake  hence the 100 hours  This game has failed to hold up and I regret wasting my money on it  I wouldn t play it anymore if I was paid to play way too frustrating  Sad that all of the issues I have with the game can be fixed  For the most part the people I ve encountered have been pleasant,negative
oh boi Oh Boi OH BOIIIIIIIIIIII,positive
I have over 300 hours in the game typically There has been a significant influx in hacking this last month which makes the game not enjoyable For example why im writing the review me and my mates played 5 games today 3 of them had an undeniable aimbotter clearing 50 people in 5 mins This last game we played where we decided to just call it quits 20 left in the server all of us get cleared within 3 seconds by AWM headshots from some player with a random letter name and numbers Now for the second part why this game will get a negative review Even with the clear optimization problems this game was a blast I honestly cant remember when i had so much fun playing a game Reminded me of the fun i had as a kid playing 16 But the developers keep not fixing crucial problems for game experience The net code is complete garbage tick rate is garbage 17 tick But they are releasing vaulting and new maps The community has been crying for net code fixes ping locks and desync fixes So its very irritating when playing this game and you spent all the time looting to get shot from around a wall by some EU or Asia player with 180 ping With that ping and the tick rate causes massive desync to where these players will see you around a corner and you on your screen have already made it to safety So with optimization problems this game is still a blast But when you pair it with not fixing very important issues and a very real influx of hacking its almost impossible to reccomend this game in its current state even with it being EA Impossible to recommend this game for people looking for a competative shooter Its just not there yet,positive
BestWorst Game ever made,positive
i love this gamebut this game is sruined cuz so many cheaters especially in asia serversalso so lag in only this game while no internet connection problem in other gameblueholecan u face on the cheating problem and make a server only for china and hong kongcuz most people cheating r from china and they even sells cheats through the voice chatblueholeu really need to ban all the cheats before u lost your customers trusti will go play csgo first as this game is litterally broken,negative

Best game plzz try it,positive
The NA and EU servers are crowded with Chinese players who 1 Don t speak any other language but Chinese  however they can tell you to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  your mother which doesn t allow for proper communication with your team You will be outnumbered in your squad if you are an EnglishFrench speaker 2 Have horrible ping and make everyone else lag3 Since a 5  share of the business is given to a Chinese company that also sells hacks within China  Bluehole is essentially encouraging Chinese players to hack I have yet to come across an EU or NA player to hack the game within the 200 hours I spent on this game Until Bluehole stops allowing hacks or puts a ping lock so that the servers can become stable again  while also still allowing me and my friends to squad up with other English speaking players I can t recommend this game,negative
Where to start with this game There are a lot of good  but also prety bad points about this gameLets start with why you want to play this gameGood  You can play the game for hours and hours  Game is fun to play  Updates are good  The game is stil growingBad  No communication from the devs  Need a prety decent rig to play  Fps drops  they are working on it  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers  they are working on it  I am a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  shot  Loads of hackers  they are working on it  The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  zone  ,positive

I was told hackers where everywhere but in my 35 hours of playing i have not seen one   that i know of  Its an awesome game I have seen a few subtle references to the amazing japanese film battle royale The game is fine for early access and is well worth what you pay for it Im not even that good at it but i still have a blast910,positive
One of the best survival games atm waited ages before i bought this game due to reviewsBut it s worth every penny  ,positive
GAME IS OVERRUN WITH HACKERSThis was a really good game until it became over run with hackers not no LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t hackers either 75  of my games i die from someone who can run 100 feet per second or i get punched when im standing in the middle of an open field and nobody is around or my personal favorite is the instant infinite headshots that immediately destroy my level 3 helmet and from any gun at any range and kill me before i can even turn my mouse I d love to see some focus of attention on such a serious problem who cares about a desert map when you can t have a legit match,negative

This game is amazing I have spent many hours playing this game with friends The new update in early November or late October seems to have made this game unplayable for me Every time I try to play this game I will get to different loading screens which will ultimately freeze my entire computer This is the only game that affects my computer negatively I have never had any problem like this on any other game,negative
Perfect game experience a great game,positive
Honestly this is one of the most poorly created games I ve played I believe the server tic rate is approximately 17 and it shows  grenades do not throw correctly shooting is a ridiculously off  eg someone will be holding still you shoot at their head with maybe 20 meters from them and it misses and jumping over things is literally the hardest thing to do in this game My understanding is that a vaulting update will be pushed soon and that s great It s literally the first update I ve seen done to this game since it was in beta  which by the way it basically is even though it s being sold as a full game I m upset with the network lag the delays in actions  shooting picking up items reloading and I m sure others are as well I do NOT recommend this game until further patches are implemented,negative
Very fun game but why is there so many asian people on the North American servers  Very annoying They keep yelling and speak in weird gribberish and most of the time they are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing terrible They have their own servers why do we have to tolerate these people on OUR servers ,positive

A very bad game in total 500H on it everything is very bad netcodegraphicsfps everything cheaters not so many but you will find one for sure here and there most of them are scripters  no recoil etc I don t recommend this game until full release and even then i ll not be sure if i ever going to install it again Now it belongs on my unintall games were it should have been many days ago,negative
Lets get this started I enjoy the game and have put a good amount of time into it The higher ranks are having cheater problems and laggy chinese men going really fast aimbot killing everybody I am not at that rank but I can say this is a fantastic game and H1Z1 has been blown out of the water If you don t mind rare encounters with cheaters and you want to get the game go ahead and get it But if you want a game with almost no modders than don t play simple as that,positive

If your computer can run this game you totally should buy it Even though the optimization sucks the actual gameplay is really fun It do need a little tweaking Although the gameplay is great the absolutely best part of the game is getting that sweet chicken dinner  Especially if you are like me and for your first 100 hours into the game,positive
literally not worth the 30 it asks for maybe not even 5,negative
This game is really fun to play at its core yet poor optimization and horrendous servers ruin this otherwise fun game ESports ready indeed,negative

Didn t get BP for my win I have the replay of the game locked in my replays Please give me my BP,positive
nicegood,positive
UPDATE  Tried playing the game again on December 21 2017 Still a bunch of 360 no scope aimbot running cheaters I ll try back if there is another major update to see if they actually delt with the problems and not trying to port it onto every console around to maximize profit before the hype dissipates Just because it has a 10 beside it doesn t make it a finished productPREVIOUS  I like the idea of this game But the amount of    360 no scope aimbot running cheaters is totally ruining the game I hope either bluehole fixes the issue or another company picks up on the idea and takes it to new heights minus the hacking and cheating,negative
This is great game One that you will play for hours if you like PVP Great concept  Still very buggy,positive
full of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cheaters stupid developers I will you all die LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s,negative
this game is better then H1Z1 version,positive
Fun game to play with friends It s very exciting  D,positive
The game itself and the concept is nice but the game is extremely poorly optimized The first person gamemodecameramode is virtually unplayable due to clunky sluggish and non responsive controls The game suffers from laughable network lag at times which in turn makes gunfights feel very rng  and doors stupidly hard to open and close The whole game just feels  off  Hard to pinpoint exactly what it is but the camera and player controls just feel weird and unnatural and the network lag can also screw up the entire experience Problems aside the game can be a ton of fun when playing with friends but from a technicalgameplay standpoint it s just way too bad for me to actually recommend this game I have an i7 6700 with a GTX 1080  11  performance overclock and even on the lowest settings possible the game is at times an absolute lagfest All in all i have clocked in a ton of hours with this game and i ve had alot of fun but at it s current pricetag  and with the technical issues i just can t summon the adequate strength to recommend this game,negative
Very fun and tactic but still needs some serious optimalisations I m running this game on 16gb ram amd fx8350 and a gtx 1070 7gb and i only manage to get a 40 50fps range on the lowest settings whilst i max out almost all other games on ultra,positive
North American servers are completely overrun with non english speaking players usually chinese This makes it impossible to play a squad with randoms because you can not communicate at all,negative

Probably the best shooter game for it s price even better with friends Ignore all the people talking about the servers and optimization the game is still in early access,positive
Game is fun and intense ish and could sometime make you feel like you want to shoot up your nearby local school This game still isn t complete yet it is still has alot of bugs and things that needs to be fixed its still an early acces There are  bugs in this game such as Vehicles somehow exploding when a part of it is in a door way or in a tight area instantly killing who ever is riding it another bug that lets you move and travel in and out of walls so basiaclly wall hax and someother And somemore bad things is that there is alot of cheats at this time 111917 i encountered alot of them while trying to win the gam late and early in it the thing is that most of them are slanted eyed dog eaters of the land of the East chinese and its just annoying The goods in this game i like is You have many many kinds of weapons you can use play styles alot of attachments and such you could win yourself a chikcen dinner by panning someone or wearing a ghillie and watch as a group of people unknowing walk by you and  put bullets up their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  or even wining just only using a vehicle The first timers in this game will get mad alot HOW IN THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  DID HE NOT DIE and such but later you ll git gud and fucc em all up but even if you played for a long time you ll still get mad at people playing the puassy style which can include camping in a place during most of the game with a weapon and just camp and all the  time But dis game is fun espically wid freinds which supprisingly i have some    810,positive
lot s of fun but to many hackers,positive
Can t even write a reviewThis game really needs to up its requirements because I can t even run this game with an Intel i5 ProcessorIf someone has a solution to making my laptop faster pls hmu,negative
The game is great with a few bugs here and there Overall tho I think this is a fantastic idea and I hope to see it continue to grow I do enjoy the chance to create a dedicated server as well so thats awesome I will say tho finding a good host for the dedicated was a challenge For anyone looking to find a great dedicated server host visit the information below Remember you need windows to host the serverDedicated Server  zerolaghost,positive

This is game is addictive but as you know it is still in early access so there s been lot of bugs but i think game is good you should try it out,positive
pretty food slow paced but unoptimised and laggyidk i guess its good,positive
it is still in early acess stages but is very promisingthough it does have some issues severs lagging and frame rate drops from time to time due to optimization issuses but other than that a great game for the price and at least they are keeping up with the updates and listening to input of the people fun game to play with friends and is very challenging but i would recomend it to anyone I have only ran into a hand full of hackers though witch is an on going issue but it rarely happens to me but thats a given to any pc game honesty always will be some and they are taking special steps to ban them as well unlike some other games i can name off,positive
fix you re LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  buggy game like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i cant play it in a dacia driving at 100kmh and the vehicle explodes out of nothing,negative
Very good and fun game not optimaized but its still pretty good,positive
I got this game about 2 months ago and it is getting worse instead of better Gets more buggy and for some reason I seem to be getting more and more fps lags I run it on medium on a pc that runs every other game on high or ultra high graphics with 60 fps Additionally requirements say 6GB ram  lol nope the game itself takes at least 8 9 gb on mine so in my experience you would like to use a 16GB Ram as mine and run nothing else at the time  oh and you will still fps lag guess what This game is not so bad but dont buy it please These devs need some punishment Got millions on their hands and they are not improving the game,negative
Needs optimization  but its good ,positive
Over 200 hours Sure I ll write a review I ll start with the positives  Fun game to play with friends  Large variety of weapons to pick from  Fun early game intense late game  If it doesn t end in a field  The feeling of satisfaction of winning a game is equal to the satisfaction of opening a tough jar of picklesNegatives  Hackers are an issue Instead of getting a VAC protection system or banning the STEAM account from playing the game they allow the STEAM account to purchase another copy and play again  Can feel REALLY unbalanced  Desync is also an issue  Last but not least it gets old and repetitive I know they are going to release a new map and some other new features but when a new weapon only comes out every few months the game just feels the same Sometimes you get loot other times you don t Sometimes you can oneshot somebody with a shotgun other times you get gunned down with a pistol But after your first 50 games i would say you ve seen all it has to offer at the time beingAll in all i prefer this game over H1Z1 mainly cause im trash at that game so i will give it a thumbs up from me Happy hunting,positive
This game is broken   Texture takes 1 minute or more to load  765 bullets won t go through thin wood neither big gaps between thin wood  765 bullet takes 5 or more hits to kill  Server synchronization is crap  Frame drops when shooting when riding a car when playing,negative

So the Chinese buy  stock so they can sell this game Then there is a massive influx in hacks and cheaters And since I last checked there are no Asia servers or at least China specifically Each game I go into for Duo or Squad matchmaking for NA server it is unplayable with randoms Nobody speaks English anymore I love this game It was fun and refreshing But now the floodgates have opened and the country that just bought stock is also creating the hacks that are being used to ruin the game for everyone Frustrating,negative
I feel like this game is the perfect survival shooter It definitely gets intense and leaves you wanting more I ve played a total of around 70 hours of this game and I have to say I m still not bored of it I can t wait until the release so we can see some more maps and possibly grapplingclimbing,positive

I honestly would recomend this game to anyone it is a challenge you have to work towards to get first place and I think it s prety worth it The devs are constantly listening to community feedback and updating the game with feedback in mind the development may not be in the best place right now but it s an early accsess game what did you expect,positive

WellI like itif you don t just don t play itGame is in EARLY ACCESS so don t whine it sucks cause it does right now but we ll get there,positive
this is one of those situations where i could give a sideways thumb  i like this game a lot and i ve had a lot of fun with it however there is an overwhelming presence of hacking currently  i ve also read lots of complaints about the advertisement push from bluehole which i wouldn t normally care too much about  however this tells me that the company wants to cash in quite quickly on the success they ve gained recently rather than making a far better optimized game  so for the moment i ll give it a thumbs down but don t take that as me saying this game is bad  i really like this game  all i would say is that i would advise caution before purchasing it,negative
the best game ive ever played in my life,positive

Dont see why people complain so much sure ive came across cheaters but the game is alot of fun and my favourite game at the minute worth getting but it is a pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at times there are stuff that needs addressing but still all in all a very good game 810 will give a 1010 when the problems are addressed hopefully with the new patch coming some of them will be sorted,positive
So i ve reached about a 106 hours around now the game has such a great potential too bad the game has been pested by so many hackersToday i ve played about 3 4 games in mid game the host disconnects  server goes down which is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lame early stage or not As a new player don t expect to live that long in since there are not any tutorials or anything on what to do you have to watch streamers etc to learn something or play atleast 20 hours in to get a proper start After theese 106 hours of playtime id easily refund if possible the game is just not worth the pricetag due to the reasons above everyone you see on the top scoreboards is 910 hackersnice try Bluehole,negative
Unbelievable bad game even ARMA 2 or 3 with a massive load of mods runs better And less hackersIf you want a battle royal game go for Fortnite Battle Royal At least Epic knows how to work with their own engine these developers dont have the slightest clue,negative

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is currently filled with hackers it s not that obvious because anyone can kill you in a few shots  or one single bullet because of some weird bugs that totally ignore what kind of helmet or armour you re wearing but some people know exactly where you are and come kill you even when staying still during several minutesI just played 2 games in a row where at least 3 people knew exacly where I was including the last one who won the game by runing directly at me when it was impossible to know where I was  I m playing FPP only btw so it s not possible to use the 3rd person camera to cheatI won around 100 games in 250 hours but it s getting really annoying to play right now because of thatI will write a new review when death by cheaters will be reduced  because I know it s impossible to totally remove them,negative
Remember the Cicret bracelet  It was a kick starter that advertised a bracelet that projected your phone screen onto your hand An idea that was great on paper but never worked in reality PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is a lot like that It s a battle royale game mode where 100 people are dropped on an 64km 2 island and strive to be the last one standing However there are more bugs than there are copy pasted assets For a start you need a computer that costs the US s GDP to run it and 90  of the time you won t see who killed you making the game extremely infuriating The rush you get towards the end however makes it all worth it in my opinion The feeling when the player counter ticks down to 2 you line up your shot and the friendly words  WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER  flash up on your screen make you feel like the most powerful person in the game A great reward is in store for those who endure the buggy mess that is PUBG,positive

Personally I love this game but the reason the reviews are mixed is because of the kiddos who get salty when they get hit by a good headshot and if it was a hacker so what the amount of people banned for that is so high its rediculous Even so what online multiplayer doesnt have hackers ALSO 30 IS NOT OVER PAYING SO SHUT YO LOVE LOVE LOVE  UP BOIBTW This game is still in Early Access so expect some things not to work 100  of the timeAnywaysPros CSGO replacement Glitches can keep it entertaining at times when your car flies into the air and lands perfectly after doing serveral flipsHours of GameplayGame is still in Early Access so expect some things not to work 100  of the timeCan be a fun time with buddies whether a duo or squadCons  You will most likely be paired with a teammate that doesnt speak your language which sucks but will only happen if you select automatch makingGliches These kind suck I have a couple buddies  this never happend to me bc i have an ssd when they dropped in it can take a minute to load the textures of buildings so they can run through walls and see loot through walls  it only lasts for a minute at most so its not super bad but still an issue,positive
I don t care what anyone says the devs are working hard on this game and it s the best game in the genre,positive
This game has the potential to be so good but it has some extremely frustrating flaws that hold it back Bluehole has more than enough resources to improve this game at a much greater rate than it has been so far so why its still in its current state is a little concerning They are still claiming a full release by the end of Q4 but I don t think thats going to happen My biggest issues with this game are as follows 1 As of 111317 the amount of hackerscheaters in this game make it unplayable Spending 20 or 30 minutes in a game only to be shot and eliniated in a matter of a few seconds by someone from across the map is unacceptable It s always being shot through walls from impossible diatances with full auto weapons or some other form of cheating Its almost every game now something like this happens and yet Bluehole claims their anti cheating measures have been ramped up and they re banning more people than ever 2 The amount of bugs in a game a month away from full release is crazy Crash to desktop stuck in wallsdoors parachute getting stuck weapons not firing when commanded not able to scope in etc I don t mind bugs here and there its impossible to have a perfect game but sometimes the game become almost unplayable 3 The optimization of the graphics is not good With some of the most recent updates my frame rates took a big dive With my set up  1080Ti   7700K I don t think I should be running mid 20 s FPS at some points of the game Alot of textures still look really bad seizure inducting texture clipping on some walls I don t know a whole lot about tech but wtf 4 Servers are always lagging You think you made in behind cover in time only to be killed behind a wall or something Why am I always in lobbies full of Chinese people  I don t mind them they seem like perfectly pleasant people but how can their ping be relative to mine  I know this has to affect the game play in some form or another 5 Advertising in game is shameful Are you that greedy for cash that you need to graffiti walls with a sponsors logoinformation  I know it seems like a petty gripe but where does it end  Our whole world is advertisements being crammed down our throats now its leeching its way into games And the paids crates I suppose the paid crates aren t a big deal as long as they re purely non game changing cosmetic items But putting paid crates in a beta seems a bit like a cash grab PUBG is alot of fun sometimes but at this point the flaws are game breaking I hope they make some changes at Bluehole and get this back on the right track again Maybe future updates will give this game the help it needs,negative
Very nice game Too much crashes on my frinds pc,positive
optimisation pls,positive
After about 4 hours worth of play time I can draw a few conclusions keeping in mind the development team is considerably small and that the game is in early accessFirst of all I ll say that this game is responsible for the coming wave of battle royale games and that PUBG s developers should not have the ability to claim rights to this genre And yes I ll say it  I actually prefer Fortnite Battle Royale over this game  Visually the game looks fine but I turned down the visuals in preference of performance I did experience frame rate drops on many occasions even with the visuals lowered especially when the map was foggy similar to the problems experienced in Fallout 4 s Far Harbor expansion Since I am particular with how my games sound I will say that this game does silence perfectly Since the premise of the game involves mostly hiding for long periods of time every noise adds tension and suspense to a life Map construction is done well aside from the fact that there s only one map Loot is evenly and realistically dispersed across a sizeable map that feels alive and dangerous However even after a few hours I got bored of seeing the same environment and the same map again and again and chances are I won t return to the game until additional maps are added as I know the developers are planning to do The only other thing I can complain about is the controls and there isn t even much to say They weren t easy to catch on to with no tutorial but after a few rounds of experimentation I was able to figure them out To sum it up there are some shortfalls but nothing that shouldn t be expected in the game s current state and I look forward to added content As it comes out I ll edit this review,positive
Got banned from game with no explanation as to why I m a brand new player and maybe played 10 games never teamkilled never won rarely got any kills No ability to contact support to remove the ban Either 30 gone,negative
Hackers and cheaters appearing way more recently making every game you play a hell of a time Well at least for me it was I was in a game where i was watching a air drop and i just suddenly got headshot with a scar which came all the way from mylta across the ocean Only one shot was fired and that one shot was the headshot that killed me I have played this game for 200 plus hours previouisly until recently I have only played for a few hours due to the amount of hackers making me feel playing this game is a waste of time as winning the game is near impossible with all these hackers around Sorry Bluehole but Im gona leave a negative review and refrain from this game until these hackers are banned and removed from the game,negative
Yes there are hackers and cheaters everywhere you go but thats not the only problem it might just be a problem for me but battle royale gets stale after a while Bluehole needs to add the new modes they were talking about like zombies 5v5 and war mode A whole game made for one mode thats set for doom,negative

Cool game but the quality hasn t changed if not even lowered If you love making your ears bleed or increasing your blood lust don t mute game chat If you love dying all the time to Chinese hackers by  headshots from out of nowhere which are impossible to pull off at times this is the game for you Love killing your computer with optimization issues and heavy loads  Then this game is the perfect fit for your needs,negative
Very good game but very much laggy I hope a full version comes soon ,positive
This is quite possibly the worst taken care of game every created it came out and it was fantastic it lagged a bit and servers were clunky but itll all get fixed right  Wrong the game has done absolutely nothing to get better in fact the only way to win or hit anyone is to have the best internet possible and hope that its enough that anything you do is actually registered server side Picking things up is awful shooting is the worst you could lay a full clip into someone never miss a shot and then they kill you because on their side they only got hit 3 times Not to mention for over 3 months there was a glitch that rendered the game unplayable if I moved my mouse to the right I couldnt shoot or aim or do anything with my mouse until I moved my mouse back to the left it made aiming and shooting impossible and if anyone was on my right side then I was sure to die Save your money and your time this game is complete and total garbage,negative
The developer planned to not release skins before the games release Everyone loses their minds The developer concedes and releases a couple skin boxes Everyone loses their minds Game is amazing Servers and optimization are constantly improving Core gameplay is amazing Hackers are being destroyed by the new anti hack 1010 would LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off whiny little kids who think cosmetic items that directly fund development of the game aren t neccessary again,positive

I bought this game thinking that it would be really cool and I was correct I think this PUBG has amazing potential and has found a rather unique niche in the first person shooter market The word potential is used with emphasis as this game does still have many flaws to overcome before it s official release Optimisation should be an absolute priority I feel at this point in time as I was surprised that my computer could not run PUBG with consistent smooth rendering on only the high graphics preset Nevermind the highestAnother priority due to the high popularity of PUBG should be buyingrenting out more servers There has been a few times at which I have received the  too many logins  error when signing into the game which undoubtedly is a few too many times considering I purchased this game with the assumption I could play it at any time It s a basic necessity for any game really Especially as there is no offline optionAmongst this there are smaller improvements that could be made such as  more guns sights wearable items consumables and maybe even a better system for obtaining items outside of matchesAll in all I feel that PUBG could either boom and be among the best games I have ever played or it could take a turn for the worst if the developers try and fully release the game too earlySide note  I understand that PUBG is still in early access and I am in no way trying to make petty complaints These are all points very much with the intention of helping to improve the game or even help to guide developers in a direction that I feel would benefit the developers and the players of PUBG overall,positive
Good game  everyone who rates this game 1star or 2 star might be against the creators nd not game this was my old review the one above when you reach 2k rating in this game u meet the real hackers who wipes the server like 70  and if u clip and send it to support u get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  response andTBH   This game has been taken over by hackers,negative
The game is awesome although I see a lot of people complaining about hackers Idk how but I have maybe died to a hacker like 2 3 times and look at my hours Probably just my luck Anyway I only recommend this game if you have a really good PC For example I ve got a gtx 1080 i7 7700 both OC I can run this game 100 fps on almost all occasions I use ULTRA textures and ULTRA AA as well as reshade The game is poorly optimized so I say wait till about end of december or so before buying the game if you have a low end PC Hope this helped,positive
While immensely flawed from the begining PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen beforeIn spite of the bugs and shoddy servers my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo s and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboardsSadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem Based upon the limited available evidence it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5  stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs Tencent s stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam statsWhile it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz Warz and H1Z1 into irrelevancy,negative

Honestly this game is great and there is so much going for it It shows a whole new gaming experience with battle royale kind of games Like Attachments Proximity chat  and even the guns are great It s a lot of new stuff with not a lot of complications Yet people are crying over the fact that hackers are ruining the game I literally rarely see any and I play a lot of duo Literally I ve seen one or two hackers but that s it Plus even if it was infested with hackers why would it matter so much  Take a game like Counter Strike GO That game is absolutely intoxicated with hackers like SVers speed Aimbot etc Plus the community is even worse But nobody really cares people still love that game the reviews are great Minecraft too  when it was huge had a ton of hackers but people loved the game still So why this game  Why PUBG  There is literally no reason to hate on it Is it because it s early access  What difference does it make It really doesn t make sense but even so no matter why people are crying over one issue the hate will probably continue But like really this game is great and you know it too be honest with yourself grow up guys It ll be fixed,positive

The game is great fun but has many flawsServers are absolutely terrible consistently lagging around and mass desyncGame has many many many hackersAt the start they released weekly updates with one big update monthly bringing new content and what not This has now almost come to a complete stop as they seem to be concentrating on putting the game out on consoleOverall you will have good fun with friends as long as you don t take it too serious and are willing to accept the above problems If you like to play a bit more serious then you are going to be frustrated as hell at the server lag  desyncWhen they actually fix the game I will change this to posotive review but for now I just can t recommend it,negative
completely overhypedawful physicsvery poor grapghics performance optimizationI have a Titan X and i have to play at LOW graphics settings to have the game run somewhat smoothlyi LOVE the concept and idea behind this gamebut the implementation is terrible I constantly think  if only PUBG had proper physics and feel like battlefield or CSGO But there are no improvements the devs focus their energy on porting the game to XBOX and PS4 instead,negative
This game rapidly went from being one of the most enticing and enjoyable products I ve ever experienced to just as quickly being one of the most annoying 1 The amount of lag after dropping in somewhere is just disgusting and is only getting worse with the increasing amount of players getting the game  which doesn t make sense because it s only 100 players per server so why does the over all volume of the game effect the individual server  Maybe it s time for a server upgrade2 Hackers own this game right now  They are working on it but this doesn t take away from the relevance3 Your client will crash whenever it feels like it4 If someone s ping is just one point lower than yours they become Angelina Jolie from Wanted and curve bullets around any obstacle so don t even bother getting behind cover5 Why is there no feature to chat through text in game  Or even in the lobby  Tf I don t know how this game is so close to being fully released and it is currently worse than it ever has been,negative

The mechanics for this game is trash It is bad enough that the game is made worse by constant hacks and cheating that the game doesn t give you enough time to actually play the game the way it is ment to be played There are a lot of things that need to be fixed and yet they are still not being fixed Not worth the effort and time Was hoping the updates would be better and the dev team would not concentrate on making new maps,negative

i have 300 hours on this game and i can 100  say that it is worth the money in my opinion its funner to play with friends but solo is still very fun so if you have the money and like shooting games or battle royale games then i 100  reccomend this game for you   ,positive
My first experience with PlayerUnkown s Battlegrounds   PUBG  was a rather negative one I had read all there was to read about the game s horrible optimization yet still had a glimpse of optimism that I wouldn t be a victim of it But that first game I got into threw all that optimization out the window when the game barely functioned at all despite me having good enough hardwareI set the settings all down to the bare minimum everything to low and then the game finally started functioning at a good and playable framerate I dive into the technicalities first before any other aspect of the game because this is a game that will stress you out and disturb you with its poor performance There will be times when menu buttons won t function you ll see errors you can r resolve and have to restart and simply bugs that make you want to pull your hair outFurthermore if you have anything less than extremely good hardware get ready to play with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor graphics since that s most the settings will let you go without causing you to stutter and get very low framerates The excuse for all of this is that it s in Early Access   and thus it s  understandable  What remains to be seen is if the issues are resolved by the time the game gets out of the early access stage  if that time ever comesBut if you can ignore all of that there really is something to be had in PUBG The concept is fairly simple   you take 100 people throw them on a large island that has ruins houses buildings vehicles towers military bases and above all weapons They scrounge the island for whatever arsenal and armor they can find and fight until one remains Eventually the playable area begins to lower until a small chunk of land is left upon which the final victor will standThis simple concept is taken and presented in a way that makes every match feel unique despite the same objective A lot of this is because of the large map that is quite vast in size Aside of the re use of the house models that are scattered across the island each location feels different and thus leads to fun experiences each time The main thrill of the game comes from all the hiding guessing and killing you ll be doing as you try to make your way to the final few survivors I d give this game a thumbs down if I hadn t too felt that rush of being among the last 10 people as you see the area around you closing in gunfires running ablaze in the distance and you re hiding in a patch of grass hoping to make it to the end and get the glorious chicken dinner That thrill is really what this game s all about and I feel as long as the developers are commited to solving the bugs and fixing the technical issues of the game there is a lot to be had and experienced in PUBG,positive

Question  when has Blueballs ever released a good game  Answer  neverI knew but I didn t listen to reason The game has potential but it s made by Bluehole I should have known I blame myself I blame Blueballs moreThe obvious money grab we all fell for hoping that they would do the right thing We only have ourselves to blame for making this game too big to fail when it should in fact be dropped like a 5 kiloton nuke because of the TOTAL LACK OF INTEREST TO FIX MASSIVE ISSUES   ping lock  lol what s that son  region lock  same thing son  glitches  oh the glitches  DESYNC   from a company that has done multiple mmorpg you would expect better  lol no son  optmized  please we re releasing for console now and then we ll start working on our NEXT GAME Sit down and shut up  cheaters  Well you re playing on PC son lol what do you expect  buy the console version kek  partnering with a shady Chinese company that sells hacks on the side   sweeeeet cash  omnomnom  banning people for  stream sniping   deal with it  random disconnects the server just puked up and the game ends prematurely Sorry you were winning not anymore son  frequent crashesVerdict  210Could be 810 or more but they gave up on us AgainEarly access is a joke but hey   Valve are possibly even bigger moneygrabbers just look at the lack of interest to fix CSGO despite picking up billions in salesAre there any decent game dev companies left ,negative

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDSThis game is still hanging too much less do optimization game experience is really to the point but the game also challenges our patience if you start how much will not play will think this is a game called  skydiving Simulator  some game player words or intimidate you or the official ban on the plug in or is enough attention good will cause the game to have to open up such severe punishment as such as adding  regional speech  game effect will be better this is I to this game all the evaluation,positive

for being 30 this games is kind of crappy because of how many bugs and physics problems causing the game to be hard to play sometimes if the developers use the thousands of dollars they have made to fix the game it will be one of the best out there,negative
Let s look at this from a marketing standpoint shall we What makes this game so successful  What draws people to it  What makes it better than other games  Why the negative review  I will answer each of these below 1 This game is successful because it s offering a more refind survival experience off the back of many other mediocre games  DayZ Arma etc with the promise that this one will be different  better It also has a name attached to it easing people s distress when buying an early access game If it s a name people recognize and have fond memories of they will be more likely to buy the game and less likely to regret their purchase This has worked brilliantly with millions of sales for an early access game and garnering an even more impressive spectating community than League of Legends previously the most popular game in the worldHowever this game pushes the envelope further with emphasizing glory to an individual  small group of players This is extremely attractive to live streamers as well as any gamer who likes to think they are better than everyone else If they fail in acquiring thier dinner consisting of chicken they can easily que into another game and complain about RNG This instant new game if dead mechanic has been popularized by World of Tanks and other games to keep playtime at a maximum Rounds are realitively quick making the game accessible to even those with limited timeMechanically this game is brilliant and will be a comparative for all future Battle Royale games2 What draws people to this game is a combination of it s own popularity as well as the addictive nature of the game Many people are buying this game simply because it s all their friends play much like Call of Duty of League of Legends simple popularity brings in more sales this much we know The other part is the games mechanics reinforcing self glorification with cognitive dissonance in the case of defeat It s the ultimate  prove yourself in battle  that so many thirst forOn top of that the game has introduced loot boxes a simple but very effective form of gambling recently popularized by Team Fortress 2   Overwatch Even going so far as to allow the sale of in game items this game is maximizing sales while milking the playerbase all without leaving early accessA genious gameplay loop which is difficult for many to put down3 What makes this game better than other games is that it provides a highly accessible platform for a long awaited genre People have been thirsting for Battle Royale after the Hunger Games was released and this is the game that provides that experienceOnce again mechanically this game is brilliant4 I ve given this game a negative review because even with all the above aspects it s not a good game What it IS is the first game to provide a refined Battle Royale experience But that doesn t automatically make it a good gameFor starters  The game is unoptomized looks flat like its parent games and runs horribly even on modern systemsServer tick rate is 16hz very low for any sort of gun gameVery buggyLaggy given that players are put into a game from all over the worldAnd that s just plain unpolished gameplay That doesn t include the loot boxes nor the disgusting cash shop they have included in the unfinished game Even the 30 price tag is steep but none the less a very smart move allowing people to justify their purchase as being half that of a AAA game Of course people will say the same things to defend this game that we ve all seen before such as   But it s not finished   Well it s PlayerUnknown he knows what he s doing   Early Access   The cash shop is all cosmetic anyways it doesn t hurt the game   Give it a bit more time   It s fun with friends   Well X person plays it so it has to be good   Well at least it s better than X game  and even  Dude everyone likes this game If this game worked as intended was polished and didn t have a cash grab mentaility it d be very hard to criticize I think the game is great for bringing the genre of Battle Royale but how it does so is very poor In fact Fortnite has their own take on Battle Royale and it s COMPLETELY FREE Also Fortnite Battle Royale actually feels like a finished game compared to this The only reason it isn t more popular is because Pubg did it first Unfortunately people have a hard time letting go of a game they have sunk a lot of time into even if a superior game is released we call this addiction  cognitive dissonanceI have no doubt that Pubg will remain popular for quite some time but please keep in mind that better alternatives do exist and will continue to be createdIt s the circle of life,negative
Good game and it runs pretty good for a AMD spec PC I run an hyperx SSD and my buildings always load fine,positive
Pubg is a fantastic game that has alot of potential The game fells optimized for newer gpus like Nvidia s 10 series as I am able to achieve 100fps in cities like PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i and Yasnaya Polyana and 144fps in areas inbetween The devs seem to hear and understand their playerbase as they are developing a new anti cheat system to try and remove most of the hackers that currently plague their servers and are always trying to find new ways to optimize their game both for the cpu and gpu as when I first got the game back in early July I was only able to play on the lowest settings while getting 60fps and currently I m capable of achieving 100fps in cities like PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i and Yasnaya Polyana at max settings,positive
Best Game I ve played in decades,positive
This game is fantastic Would buy again,positive
Do I recommend this game  Absolutely not unless you re willing to put up with a game with many technical problems Which includes poor framerates bad optimization and a plethora of other problems Is the game still fun  Absolutely I ve put in plenty of time into this game and I ve enjoyed it It s sad that third person isn t as fun due to giving everyone an unfair advantage but what are you going to do Verdict  I would recommend waiting a bit to see if the game fixes major glaring issues I don t regret my purchase but I thought I d share my experiences,negative
Hunger Games with Guns and being pushed to a smaller area to fight for your own life Yes,positive

as someone who runs most new AAA games on max graphics i have to say i have never seen such a badly optimised game on the absolutely lowest settings i run it at 30 fps i wont ever change my review if they dont fix this asap Apart from that the game is great it has the potential to become the best Battle Royale game ever if they just fixed the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lag,negative
PUBG is a battle royale  pvp style multiplayer FPS Start off in a plane with 100 players up to 4 players per team   choose where you parachute down Once you hit the ground quickly find a gun and take down everyone else trying to take your loot in the area The loot consists of items to heal yourself armor guns   attachments for them Each map has their own variation of vehicles   gunsRecent patches have made the game much more playable from a performance stance compared to how it wasCurrently there are a couple of major things stopping this game from being flawless at any rate First of all the huge amount of bugs from things stopping your characters shooting to vehicles instantly killing you from the slightest tap or from tripping up on thin air as well as things not loading in or bullets not registering etc But the main thing is the huge amount of hackers at the moment people who are shooting through walls flying around aim botting no recoil scans for the map to get the best loot   anything else you can think ofI would say to keep an eye on the progress of the game as it has regular updates   wait for the vast hacker problem to be sorted,positive
NoiceGood game took a while for them to optimize but now runs all goodDefinitely recommend grabbing a friend or two for this game its fun solo for a bit but best played with othersServers are still quite laggy and picking up things at the beggining of the game can be a hasslePlayed over 100 hours and so far only encountered 2 hackers so for the majority of the game time you should be hacker freeFun game to play with friends i would recommend if you want to have a laugh and some fun,positive
Would be a great game without the loads of technical bugs  On top of all those awful RNG and horrificly bad Optimization make this game borderline unplayable at times,negative
Cheater is everywhere Unplayable,negative
The best game ever Winner winner chicken dinner,positive
Great visuals and effects in terms of sound and realism etc but the game needs to be optimized and fast inorder to keep all its players and to get a whole load more,positive
How about making a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing anti cheat system that actually LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing works   And how about fixing this bug when it finds a match and the whole pc crashes  AND HOW ABOUT FIXING EVERY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BUG ON THIS BROKEN GAME INSTEAD OF RELEASING NEW CLOTHING   ,negative
Its a broken game,negative
Don t buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game you will get banned eventually Honestly this game can be fun if you have friends But after just 150 hours of playtime I got banned and I dont know why It wasn t even a battleye ban cause I asked support and they said that battleye didnt ban meJust dont buy it if you dont wanna waste 30 just play fortnite  even though its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
not easier to clear all the cheater bro my respect to developers,positive
nice game but needs to get optimiziation,positive
awsome first or third person shooter,positive
The game is obviously in constant need of work  Totally 100  understandable because it wasn t released as a fully completed game  I get that and I hope others do  It s fun  Being trolled and getting trolled in fun  Cheaters make it hard sometimes but they are always getting caught and i ve been seeing it less and less frequent  Solid game,positive
Game with a lot of potential and gotta admit is a blast when you can get a group of friends together to play If they can just work out some bugs and fix the hacking issue just wait till this actually makes it out of beta and see the progress they do actually make but I would recommend that you don t but it quite yet if you haven t already  EDIT   4182018   Game is still plagued by hackers on an alarming rate of games played and there are still a number of bugs and glitches The updates are very slowly giving things people actually want and seems they re still too focused on making new crates with weapon skins and other cosmetics to suck more money out of people instead of doing things to make the game better A huge dissapointment honestly seeing what games like Fortnite are doing and doing so much better than pubg for free I would recommend not wasting 30 on this game honestly The more I play the more terrible bugs I experience on top of heavy server lag and frame drops makes this hard to play sometimes makes me shake my head,negative
hit system is just non exsistant  i dont have a super connection but its not bad either and out of the last 10 times ive played 9 of them ive come up behind people that didnt even know i was there dumped an entire mag into them and 9 times they have turned around and shot me and killed me one shot thats insultingjust got new pc  top end and hardline connection  cat 6  Playing on my local server and just like 90  of every time ive ever played this game  come up behind some noob that has no idea im there less then 10 feet no cover of any kind between us drop the entire mag andnothing  this game is a joke  Dont waste a penny,negative
Developer and Brandon are complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bags and I wish I can get a refund I will never play this game againI like the realistic look and all that but the business practices of this company is just horrible and I will not play their game any longer,negative
PrioritiesTheir top priority is microtransactions and even that is wrong They have sold keys to later change their conditions  I feel cheated by the Aviator boxes Blocked indefinitely without news for a week this week they wrote a presumptive DevBlog of business transparency I understand that if there is a problem they have to fix it but they could have tried the changes with free boxesOn the other hand there were problems with purchased keys that disappeared from your inventory however they did not block the sales of keys until they fixed it  priorities And today I saw in Reddit Mr PUBG_Riggles  Comunications lead asking for good reviews for an update that is not even on the live servers Here you have your review because in reddit or twitter you do not pay attention to this problem,negative
INTRODUCTION I bought this game back in August of 2017  I had known about it for several months but decided to hold off on it as I wasn t ready to get back into the multiplayer shooter genre  My Youtube channel ended up switching over from Clash Royale to PUBG  I now livestream PUBG 7 nights a week on my channel as a full time job  I have about 1200 hours into the game with probably over 200 wins although I do not keep track of my winsTHE GOOD Many years ago I was a competitive Halo 1 multiplayer gamer  I lost my interest in being a competitive gamer because there wasn t really any shooters I felt addicted to enough to put in that kind of time and commitment  It can be very frustrating and you can lose a lot of sleep because of practice marathons  CSGO was the only shooter that I had thought about getting into but was already worn out on that game from the original CS mod for Half Life  PUBG has reinvigorated my passion for competitive gaming  The graphics are realistic  The variety of weapons is awesome with new ones on the way  The bullet drop feels realistic  coming from someone who was a Gunner s Mate in the Navy  I m also a big fan of the overall military feel of the game  You get such an adrenaline rush from knowing that you can t respawn and that once you die the match is over for you  My heartrate still gets pumping everytime I m in the top 10  I love the fact that I can play with my friends in squads  This is my favorite mode to play in  They also have Solo and Duo s you can play  I m happy they added an FPP mode as well as third person feels clunky unrealistic  due to third person peeking and slow  They now have a third map Codename  Savage that they are working on and seems very promising as I have played it both times they ve made it live on their Closed Experimental Server  This game has a lot of promise and could potentially become the next big Esports game  One in which I would love to compete in professionallyTHE BAD 10 Release came out in the middle of December 2017  Unfortunately the game still has a lot of the same issues we ve had since I ve been playing it  And still feels like an early access game to me  Most of the problems and bugs the game has you don t see in typical AAA titles when they come out with their 10 full release  The game still has major desync issues mostly I believe to be caused by the Asian players that come onto the North American servers  It could also be that the developers never expected the game to be so record breaking and are having a hard time getting enough servers to accomidate the millons of players they have worldwide concurrently  It becomes very frustrating to peek from your cover and shoot someone then once your back behind your cover you get shot and die  Sometimes I will shoot someone out in the open with my reticle right on them and not hit them once because they are desync dlagging so bad  This is unacceptable to me given that it s 2018 and I have very fast cable internet  Also because I live so close to one of the NA servers  Sometimes the desynclag feels so bad that I think it s worse than it was on Halo 1 when I played that competitively 15 years ago  This has been an issue since I first started playing the game and only seems to be getting worse  There has been an outcry by the community for the devs to put in a region lock for many months now  At first the creator Brendan Greene called the community a bunch of racists and xenophobes  Which was incredibly insulting  Then about a month ago they said they would release a region lock soon but we have yet to see it come to fruition or hear about their progress with implementing it  They supposedly released a soft ping lock in the game but yet I can still hear Asian players over the proxy chat while in game  Although these Asian players could be using a VPN to fool the servers into thinking they have a lower ping than they really do  Am I starting to sound racist myself   No  I feel this way about the Asians because Battleye  PUBG s anti cheat software company itself has released statistics that 99  of the cheaters in the game come from China  This is another issue that I feel the PUBG team DOES take seriously but they are not stern enough about  Most competitive multiplayer games have an extremely stern anti cheat system in place  So much so that they will implement a ban mid game  And typically it s an IP ban  I have never seen so many cheaters in any multiplayer game as much as I have in this one  This could be because the game is so record breakingly big  It could also be because of the monetized skins available  My game still does crash from time to time although it is not as bad as it once was so I feel they are making progress on that  It crashes just as much now as any other AAA title I play does  I do get some wierd FPS drops on occassion more so on the test and experimental servers though  The FPS drop frequency varies from update to update  I feel that the desynclagcheater problem would be greatly reduced if they simply followed the successful actions other AAA developers have taken by implementing tougher anti cheat like IP banning or even Steam account removallimitation  Implementing a region lock will greatly aid in this as well  One thing which I feel isn t much of a big deal is I wish they would add weather back and allow for mapweathertime of day selection  I don t mind the desert map but when you get the desert map 15 times before you get the original Erangel map again gets a bit frustrating and boring  I feel as though they will be bringing weather back as they have been testing it on the new Savage map  I think people kept leaving the Fog map before because the fog was so thick that you could hardly see anything  I think if they just tone it down a bit people will enjoy it and play it again  Finally some of the playstyles you see in the game can get a bit frustrating  I like to either land far away from the plane alone with my squad to loot comfortably and then go hunting or drop into a hot location just so that I can get into fights and warm up a bit  One of the things I loved about this game is that they had a blue zone that pushes the players together to prevent camping  Most aggressivecompetitive players would agree with me that camping is a boring and not a fun way to play  But there are still players who will camp in the corner of a building  even in FPP mode without peeking just to wait until they hear your footsteps and shoot you in the back  It makes no sense to me that they are so scared in a video game A VIDEO GAME   A video game is meant to be fun  It s not fun to me to sit in a corner and just hide the whole time  I ll never understand why people do this  This isn t necessarily something Blue Hole can fix as it happens in every multiplayer shooter game  So I can t blame the devs for this one  People will also try to fight with you outside of zone not scared of the blue zone  They buffed the damage by the zone but people still do it  I think they need to make the blue zone more damaging than it already is to discourage thisCONCLUSION This game is a great game overall despite the issues mentioned above  It s incredibly addicting and one that I feel I would want to play competitively in Esports  Once the issues are fixed and come out with a real 10 release  one that is polished and bug free this game has the potential to be a 1010 game  Just like Perfect Dark and Zelda  Ocarina of Time were back in the late 90 s  The game is only 30 which is half the price of any other AAA title which I feel makes the game worth it  Even though I joke on my channel when I m having a bad night and say I don t recommend the game I definitely do  Buy this game  If I can get over 1200 hours out of a 30 game that in my book makes it a must buy,positive
Filled with hackers and excessive lag Game is trash,negative
u know u shouldn t play a game when you spend half of your play time angry that the game doesn t load in properly,negative
Not sure if I can recommend this game just yet Still plagued with issues that ruin it for me I ll list some pros and cons  Pros   Super fun to play with friends   Recoil mechanics are suitable for the style of game and are enjoyable   It s a realistic battleroyale with a great level design Cons   Still suffers from d sync Every now and then the game will lag and jitter especially when engaging in fights   Terribly optimised even when played on low settings  I run a gtx 1060 6gb  i5 7600k with 16bg ddr4 ram Not sure what bluehole have done here but they could learn a thing or two from Fortnite or Planetside 2 Sure they aren t well optimised either but are leagues ahead of this game  Movement and jump mechanics feel unpolished and janky It s 2017 how do you not have good movement mechanics   Hackers Everywhere And it s painfully obvious In summary I really want to enjoy this game and I ve played some rounds that have been super fun But there are so many issues that really kill the game and need to be fixed ASAP To anyone who is looking at buying this game I would say save your money and wait In its current state it s way too overpriced for what you get Hopefully they fix these issues If and when that happens this game will be a masterpiece until then its mediocre at best,negative

I ve been playing the game since April this year and I can say that the game has been updating quite nicely the first few months But since the JulyAugust update I  and many others from what I ve seen on forums have been experiencing massive FPS drop when dropping out of plane world loading extremely slow  so called  melted buildings The problem is not in my setup since I had no major issues when I first began playing the gameI played the game for around 300 hours but each time it is more and more frustrating to play because I can t parachute to an area where other people are parachuting Either I have 1 frame each 2 seconds or I can t enter buildings to pick up weapons to fight I got bored of low loot zonesThey plan to release the game at the end of this year but they still have this game breaking bug since JulyAugust,negative
Would love if the game would actually work since the latest update I haven t been able to play the game because it does nothing but freeze everytime I load into a game And the one game I did get into the servers timed out,negative

I ve had nothing but issues from the moment i purchased this game  Apart from being poorly optimised the game simply will NOT work no matter what I try  At first it was just connectivity issues with the make and model on my router instantly blocking any traffic from the game for some 3 months  I m not using that router anymore but it wouldnt suprise me if it wasn t fixed  I ve had a fresh install of windows 10 with a brand new SSD and it wont even get past the title screen  It crashes as often as an early acess title if not more  This company is as poorly run as any I ve ever seen  They focus more on getting asmany people playing as they can to get as much money as possble instead of just FIXING the versions of the game that already exist  It s beyond pitiful  It s downright criminal  F    the PUBG corporation  I ve spent 75 hours playing this game and half of that haven t seen a fully finished game,negative

REAL GOOD,positive
After 300 hours of gameplay I can say that the game is very intense It gets your heart pumpin when there s some spicy action going on You are guaranteed action every single game I ve loved every single minute of this game up until recently We went from seeing a cheater once every 10 matches to seeing a cheater every match My partner   I are ranked in the top 500 s for duos   every single match for the past month we ve been matched against cheaters everytime I m not saying this because I m mad someone else better than me managed to kill me I m saying this because it s obvious when someone is cheating Just look at the kill feed when you re passed 25 alive Multiple headshots by the same guy consecutively using AKM or any other kind of weapon I wasn t going to bother writing up a review about it until my last match with my partner I have video proof from my last match of someone using speed hacks to run to the middle of the zone We placed 2nd against that cheater At this point if you manage to get to the final top 10 s it s hacker vs hacker Whoever has the best hacks wins the chicken dinner I don t even know why the cheaters hack this game They are totally removing the whole point the game has to offer Surviving with what you have and using any kind of tactic until you are the last man standing is the whole point of this game By cheating they re ruining their experience of the game for themselves and they re ruining it for everybody else  There s no leveling up or XP in the game so why even bother cheating  Are they cheating just to rank up in the leaderboards ,negative
I ve only played 20 hours but the time I have spent in this game has been enjoyable,positive
Lag Desync More Lag More Desync Apologies from the Devs followed by delays more bugs and further apologies for the delays    Bear with us    If v 10 doesn t fix most issues in the game it will die fast Can t wait for a AAA Developer making a game in this genre10 Release Edit  Still Lag Still Desync Still more lag Still more desync Even more apologiesgame is still not polished I REALLY can t wait for an alternative to this game,negative
At first i loved the game but its now 8 months later and they havent fixed the inconsistencies first a shotgun takes one hit to kill someone point blank now it takes 2 then it takes one the next game the amount of money they made is disgusting compared to how much they put back into it i would not reccomend this game to anyone until they start fixing the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t this game has,negative

It is a very good and interesting game but it has a big problem for many players or for people who want to buy this gameThis problem is the fact that it have big requirementsso your computer should be a good oneThat means that you should have a gaming computer or you should buy expansive components to add to your existent computer,positive

I love PUBG,positive
Sadly I cannot recommend this game in its current state Whilst the game itself is good it suffers from some issues including bad performance on high end systems  I m only getting 45 FPS on low settings with an AMD Ryzen 7 1700 and Nvidia GTX 980 and buggy netcode Until these issues have been fixed I don t recommend buying it,negative
Great game Tho there are some bugs to fix But overall a great game to play yourself or with friends,positive
way to laggy and the death cam i broken af,negative
Good concept the features being added are great and its physics are great however it s quite laggy and should be optimized for lower specced computers Therefore its not really worth the 30 i paid for it but its still in early access so there is still HOPE,negative
I like the where s Waldo shirt 1010,positive
I jumping but this LOVE LOVE LOVE  game offline,negative
Here we have the classic core arena gun finding search and destroy games from dayZ to H1Z1 and pubg at last the game looks better then all of them but the problems remain as low optimization and bugs  without rewards if you win and the lootcrates seem not worth at all  its early acess i get it the will fix bugs and optimize but that should have been fixed by now its months out and they have money to do it  Adding new map and vault is core gameplay to it and having fun with a squad with friends is a nice thing to do Very good looking graphic game and stratigic to play  Hard earned win and so Would recommend since its kinda trend and many players on it,positive
After the latest patch which the anti cheated system set online Now I can entitle five star recommended for this game,positive
I think that this game is quite terrible I didn t find any fun in it,negative

At the moment I saw this game for the first time I fell in love with it I delete all other games from my computer  no time for them    Absolutely brilliant idea dynamic tactical shooter  3rd and 1 person mode Ofcourse  there is a lot to do and fix in game   it is still early access The goal is to eliminate 99 players and become number 1 At the beggining you land on giant island with small villages buildings  constructions etc and start looking for equip and guns the most interesting thing is that you are limited in time each round is about 3  5 minutes and the circle is becoming smaller so you have to move into it if outside   die  ABsolutely 5 Stars   RECOMMEND,positive

Recently there have been a lot of hackers  no recoil  aimbot  speed hack  wall hack I m sure people get banned all the time they just make a new account and do it all over again The game itself is great its just hackers ruining it and making people give the game a bad reviews,positive
OK I really like this game My frinds and I play regually and enjoy the hell out of it ButFirst off let me get the good points out of the wayHuge map Okay there is only one map but thats all we need for the time being It is big enough to fule the first 200 maches or soThis game requires either no skill or all the skill It isn t hard to get to the top 10 if you know where to hide but if you intend to kill people thats where it gets a little tough at times This might seem to be a bad point to some but if you just want a lazy game hiding can be quite funYou will need team work if you want to live In duos or squad comunication is key You will need to give barings shair loot and run into fire or you and your team will die rather quickly This makes the game really fun to play as you are on a constant look out for other teams and dangersThe devs are actually woking on the game Un like a few ambitious Early Access Games where the devs put in a few months of updates then they slowly get less and less these guys are active and update the game regually  somewhat and inform their playerbase of what to expectNow for the bad bitsThe price Its expensive for what it is and for the state of the game 27 is pushing it a little for the state of the gameOnly one map Okay I know I said its enough for now but when you clock in a few hours the map gets pretty oldNo single player mode I know this is a multiplayer game but it does literally just dump you in the middle of everyhitng without explaning everything or anything for that matter A mode to explore the map to see how things work or even a shooting range would be nice just to get used to the game for new players and to use the new weapons that get implamentedLack of content There is a so called  zombie mode  on its way but its basically the same thing as the bace game A more inventive game mode would be welcome but i think they are focusing on other aspects of the game for nowThe devs Multiple cases of falce reports leading to bans that souldn t happen Only focusing on making streamers happy instead of all their players  Start with optimisation These are the common issues you will see people mention in their reviews and its true I hven t had any issue with optimisation but its still a down side for other people especially with the price of the game its a gamble if the game would be bale to run or not even if you meet the min or max requierments It is buggy Although there a regular hot fixes and what not the game is still pretty buggy Although it is expected if you want a flawless game this isn t it Thnakfully most of the bugs that cause you to fall out of the map cars blowing up and all that have beem patched out  I think But there are still a few that break the game or the experiance My friend died from a car explotion  in game when he was well a way from it and instantly died We were in duos We were on top of a hill The car was all the way at the bottomb and then someCheaters hackers Although un common  in games I have played they take the fun out of the game immencely nothing like getting insta killed form across the map or even being killed by the same guy that just killed 4 other people in that same second Blue hole has said that they are taking new mesures to fight against them it isn t enough Thretan legal actions aginst the websites that sell these hacks make an example of those that do multiple offences It just seams like they aren t that bothered at the minuteComunication  not the type where you talk to your tem We all love to trash talk from the safety of out computers but it gets old quickly 12 yolds spouting racist comments mic spamming in the lobby Sure you can swap channels in the options but that isn t the point It isnt all children though some  adults  from the sounds of it My point is its fun to do the first few times you play but after that it gets old FastAll in all if you really want the game and want to support the devs get it If you are on the fence about getting the game I d reccomend that you wait a while for the game to be optimised and the hacker problem to subside I do really like the game and want to see it grow but I feel I cant 100  reccomend it to people In its current state510 would pay 6000 battle points to change my race and hair then to change my gender  3000 bp to change how your character looks,negative

Its a good concept for a game and all but the devs are so greasy and lazy this game gets worse and worse as time goes on For example the desync is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing terrible the shotguns are more inconsistent then a 50 year woman menstrating the controls are clunky and annoying The rain makes it so hard to hear footsteps the bullets sound like they are coming from everywhere the directional sound is disgusting the mini 14 is broken and op Close range fights are basically luck based on how the servers want the game to go Instead of hosting LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  multi thousand dollar tournaments where people camp outside the zone and win with 2 kills how about you use the money to fix your game,negative

Loved the game until a few weeks ago and can t recommend it until it is fixed This game suddenly became INFESTED with cheaters I literally can t play a game without being killed by oneit s sad Reporting cheaters does nothing Most of the cheaters have names like Qj7262663727aim bots silent movments speed bots u name it Please fix so we can enjoy the game againor change your company name to brown holebecause that s a name that seems to be sticking the past month The problem seemed to start after the update when the default server was changed to Asiacoincidence  Love it when I get killed by a hacker yelling  China 1  well China is definitely 1 at destroying this game for sure Bugs and server problems are common Especially with a new game in a beta release a new company and a viral following,negative

Pros     pinnacle of Battle Royale Creative environment  you can do many things to reach the goal of the game Strategic emphasis  Such environment means you re going to have a hard time if you play it like CoD aim is not everything Teamwork and communication  try playing with microphone when you re with friends you re going to see that s it s vital Intense firefights  It is as easy to kill as to die Cons   Some bugs and weird in game physics Small amount of unexpected server crashes which suddenly make many players suffer as they wait,positive

Well here we goPUBG is a fantastic game at its core but most recently it has been plagued with Bugs in game advertisements  holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you make how much money and you have to advertise your own game IN GAME WTF and overall bad optimization I personally have a 1950X GTX 1080 Founders Edition 32 Gb of ram etc and I cant even get 60 FPS on high settings I know it is not on my end due to other games running completely fine but this one is just crap Secondly you add in advertisements for your own game in the game itself You guys have profited at least 1 million dollars and you had to put in graphics in game that say  Watch our ESL game coming up  like anybody cares  It makes nobody want to watch it and it is just sad that you had to steep this lowLastly the bugs Holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the bugs This game on my computer alone crashes at least 2 3 times per game due to unoptimization and some major LOVE LOVE LOVE  bugs Get your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together Bluehole and fix this game Overall I would love to give this game a  Yes  recomendation but with the current problems and ads  in a 30 game that we have to pay for I have to say no If these problems are fixed I may as well change the No to a yes but it will stay a no until you do soThanks,negative

Its a very good game despite all of its flaws fun to play haters go away,positive
TL DR  Game was great concept but rough around the edges Developer was slow to fix problems made money got complacent and the game is now infested with Chinese hackers810 at launch 310 in current state   I bought it 3 4 months after launch It was well worth the 30 dollars I spent for the amount of enjoyment I got out of it   If I had purchased the game 2 months ago I could not say the same   The game is early access and so there s a lot of major issues including optimization and glitches which can be discarded as typical early access phenomena That said major issues with the game s engine have been unresolved since launch obvious client side exploits have existed without any acknowledgement from the developers and the game world is laughably strung together    This game is not competitive The sheer fact that ANY tournament was held is an insult to the consumer The game itself does not lend itself to any sort of esport One of the biggest elements in PUBG is luck The drops you find the circle s positioning on you vehicle spawns and more are all almost entirely out of the hands of the player WHICH IS FINE But the only reason it s fine is because PUBG is a GAME It is not an esport and should NEVER be viewed as one Furthermore the state of the game is absolutely pathetic for any sort of competitive environment Grass doesn t render in after a short while which means you can be camoflaged on your screen and completely in the open on another player s Objects render in differently depending on distance so that tree you re hiding behind could be slightly to the left on someone else s screen Water is an impenetratable shield against bullets  watch the ending circles of the Gamescom Invitational to see why this is an issue The vehicle physics are an actual meme Literially they are the running joke of PUBG   Now for the client side issues From the beginning of the game it was obvious that too much of PUBG was in the hands of the client and not the server If your teammate had poor ping he would run faster than you EVEN WHEN HE SHOULD BE SLOWER Now to be fair this is an issue that can and should be overlooked in the context of an early access game However these issues were completely overlooked in the development schedule Instead of addressing the issue that would no doubt lead to major hacking problems the developers ignored it issued slap on the wrist punishments to a handful of ini tweakers and proceeded to focus development elsewhere When we needed engine work regarding anti cheat we got a grenade rework that still doesn t work properly This led to the massive hacker infestation currently plaguing the game Needless to say the ease at which the game can be hacked is hilariously sad Speedhackers and aimbots run amok in at least half the games played Worse yet hackers can shoot through terrain from miles off You can be killed inside a house by a person sitting in a field 3 miles out from you   One of the saddest points in this game however has to be watching the developer grow complacent The amount of small QoL updates and new gunsweapons has dropped from bi weekly to bi monthly More time has been spent by the lead dev tweeting at streamers than discussing development progress on the game It s very obvious at this point that PUBG has made it s money and it s done It ll continue to update of course but it is not eager to make itself into a better game anymore The game that was seemingly immune to the early access curse has fallen to it   I could go on about the state of the game but all you need to know is don t buy Wait Maybe when the developers get organized and commit themselves to making their game legitimately great will it be worth the buy Right now the game is so overun by hackers that it s lost the only element that made it playable  fun,negative
Dsync sh t servers not even optimized 010After release its worse,negative
i have been playing this game for 200 hours and i still think its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  some timese i have fun but there are so many game braking bugs and glitches its hard to have fun its a good game but the game is hidden under so much LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative
I would like to say people put all these dislikes onto a game that is still in BETA Not many games can compare in BETA and this one is showing extraordinary game play The game isn t perfect yet however what game is  i would argue this is the game I have personally been waiting for and all of you should try it The mechanics are nice so don t hate Enjoy the game guys 1010 would recommend Also I got almost 300 hours on this without ever being bored So for all those saying people playing are in awe and that s why is not true,positive
PUBG is incredibly fun that much needs to be said It s a lot more fun playing with friends but soloq or PUGing is also great The matchmaking is amazing from the time you die and restart it s less than a minute before you re teamed up and already in the next matchBUTThe game runs like absolute garbage The game looks WORSE than garbage You could show this game to someone in 2006 and they would be surprised at how bad the game looks Granted graphics aren t everything This is even more unforgivable because I don t know if there is a PC in existance that can run this game at 60 fps at max settings Not that you would want to run it at max graphics anyway The optimization is TERRIBLE Sure it s  early access  but Bluehole have made millions off this game and there have not been preformace improvements I give PUBG a big up for pioneering in a sense the 100 person battle royale style game but sincerely hope a better game manages to be as purely fun as PUBG is but looks modern and is properly optimized,negative
playable only on 1060 grapichs or betteron low settings thodont get jebaited like me by those fake minimum requirements,negative
EDIT  After launch now BLuehole ignores china cheater and lag problem by not region locking the asia players to asia serversPut in creates that you unlock with hard earned ingame currency but cant open them unless you pay for a key with real moneyDO NOT BUY THE GAME,negative

Cheaters are rampant and the developers do not seem to have an understanding of the problem or the ability to address it To give you an idea about 70  of my solo games are ending in a flurry of aimbot headshots right now  along with speedhacking aimbotting is the most common form of cheating in this game at them moment The numbers are slightly less for Duos and Squads but still pretty badBugs optimization lack of features these are the types of things that one should expect in early access I m ok with those Cheaters ruining the majority of every game you try to play  For weeks on end  That s unnaceptableSo you just need to decide if it is worth 30 bucks to play a game where you will more often than not die to someone cheating To my mind no way That is a waste of money So my recommendation is to hold on to that hard earned cash and play another game until you hear from the community that this problem has been resolved,negative
The full release of this game is imminent and yet the servers have the worst tick rate of all games out there This game is known for desync lagg and frame drops since the very beginning and there was barely any significant progress in all the months of development to combat the desync and lagg In addition to that the gaming experience gets crushed through various  minor  things that never get fixed such as the sudden game crashes the wrong pre selected serverregion after finishing a game buildings having wooden bars stopping you from shooting through impenetrable railings and handrailings and the list of super annoying things goes on and on This game is far away from being fully developed and is definitely very far away from being e sports ready,negative
good game really love it  ,positive

this game is unplayable right now there are to many hackers and the hackers make other want to hack i cant play a game with out it being ruined by people lagg switching you causing network lagg around them selves so no one can do any thing around them then they turn it off and every one of their team has already killed youthere is also a new hack being used that is untracable where they are some how disconnecting which makes the entire game close out people close by and kill them before they get back in the game then it just says you died and you dont get a name to report then there is aim boting wall hacking shooting threw walls and invincibility they say they are doing things to counter act this but in all reality its getting worst by the minute   saucehttps clipstwitchtvPatientEnthusiasticTigerPipeHype i have heard nothing back from the devs on this either i reported him and his friend,negative
This game is a blast playing with my friends and randoms is a rollercoaster of emotions in a good way the fun almost never stops when it does however it gets LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing rage inducing i m talking about hackers in the game aimbots damage hacks speed hacks and increased  infinite health hacks are extremely common and ruin any game we might have the whole point of the game is the tense moment to moment feeling you get waiting for an opponent as you loot anxiously waiting for someone to shoot you as you traverse an open area etc these are the selling points of PUBG these are what make the game fun and great with hackers all over the place you won t get that experience it ll be like having a sandwich that s got nothing in between the bread boring dull and predictable PUBG isn t what it is with these hackers and for that reason i cannot recommend the gameTL DRpubg is a great game about tension and thrills with hackers dominating the servers it is literally unplayable will change when bluehole  hopefully fixes this problem,negative

  110 million one year revenue  Piece of garbage  Buggy as hell  Crashes often  Developers drinking pina coladas in The Bahamas  Not bothering to hire new workers  Still drinking pina colada  Defaults my server to AS   Microtransactions  Flying cars confirmed  Molotovs still not working  Developing slower than DAYZ standalone and if that s not an indication of quality then I don t know what isWhat this game does well It was fun for a while,negative
This game is plagued by cheaters I have been killed by players with speed hacks moving 4 times normal Game in it s current state is woeful Might delete Cheaters are not moderated effectively,negative

Expected more from this game Playing at low settings with GTX 1070 and match even not loading in 50   After load buildings models is weird and can t anything near 1 minute The worst optimized game I ever seen ,negative
It is a good game for fun,positive
As you can see by my playtime I ve played my fair share of the game I loved it At first But it has been letting me down so much lately that I would rather have not bought itFirst it s full of bugs Small things like physics not displaying till the hit boxes not being in the right place But lately it s has been game breaking bugs like disconnects game crashes and the likesWhat finally made me delete this game was the anti cheat service BattleEyeI m playing on a machine that I work on also BattleEye now disconnets me for having a disallowed program running Which is VMWare Player and Workstation I will now have to disable my VMWare services everytime I want to play or uninstall VMWare completely Not going to happen I uninstalled this game insteadSupposedly they found a hack which they could not detect but was run from a virtual machine so they just blocked all virtualization software I d like to know what they do when they have a headache  Cut of their heads Do not buy,negative
Hit and miss game filled with bugs and issues Needs a region lock needs lots of bug fixes and is desperate for optimisation Great tactical shooter with incredible potential but still has a long way to go,positive
One of my best Top ten games,positive
Great game but needs to fix some issues regarding performance and cheaters I d definitely recommend it though as even with its flaws it is very much enjoyable,positive
This game can be great fun Unfortunately 90  of the time its utter garbage If you arent dying to someone with better ping than you or hacks you are running from the zone or enjoying the vehicles that are either abundant or non existent Did I mention the simple act of going from flat grassland to an actual road can flip your car if not utterly destroy it Dont even bother with the hilly parts of the map as you cant aim up while proned on a hill Fog maps look like cancer rain maps kill fps and the game is so horribly optimised that sometimes buildings will fail to load at all If this happens to you have fun seeing and shooting through walls as well as driving through them If I didnt properly emphasise it there is almost always a hacker on every server  Sometimes there are hackers fighting each other for the main spot while you cower in a corner and hope to god that they somehow die before finding you Aim hacks are bad enough but speed hacks are plain insanity impossible to hit and faster than your car Then there is walls lower tier aim hacks as well as loot hacks etc that make this game seriously frustratingTo address the better ping thing Im not talking about just missing constantly and blaming lag Im talking about shooting and getting blood splats but not registering hits Its happened to me both ways shooting someone 3 4 times while they are running only for them to one shot you with a shotgun and for none of that damage to register Inversely getting blood splats all over you but one tapping someone with a shotgun or headshot will leave you unharmedYes its early access but that doesnt excuse the company and the shady marketing tactics  look up the relationship between Bluehole and Tencent you will be surprised This game has been utterly ruined by hacks and terrible optimisation From someone who has consistenly played casually since the day of release PUBG has never been in a worse state,negative

Since another patch  Game has now decided that it would like to tinker with things that are not broken rather then work on fixing things that matterAfter some Patching    They have now balanced it where you get a good balance between the two maps  Hit box s continue to be a issue but until they come up with a system where they place you in server based on ping they will always have issues  Part 2 of the hit box issue is that it depends on client side what this means is that you might get shot all the while on your screen you are safe behind a tree or wall etc etc  So until they find a nice balance between these they will always struggle on this front However with the ammount of cheaters I see daily I can no longer recommend this game  It is disgusting how blantant the cheats are and you have no clue if your report has even done anything  The reward is to survive and having cheaters take that away all the time makes it a pointless waste of time    Hacking is was and will continue to be a problem with this game  As they come out with anti cheat measures the cheaters in turn come up with new ones  Problem with cheating in this game the whole premise is to survive and in 1 swift second a hacker will ruin this for anyone that come into his path  We have come into servers with hackers taking bots around to farm the in game currency  They then go on to sell the items they farm and if they get banned they have made more then enough to just buy another copy wash rinse repeat  Some solutions to this would be having the bans go hardware rather then client as it would be more costly to replace computer parts  They could also make a server for cheaters and once guilty lock them in there and let them play with each otherOverall with the hours I have put in you can see that I enjoy the game it s addictive to chase the dinner but be warned if you have a temper move the expensive stuff awaySince Full LaunchI miss SchoolFull launch ReviewThey have taken strides in dealing with hackers but you at times still find the odd one Otherwise it is a highly addictive game that is enjoyable with your buddies up until they kill you by mistake when you walk into a room and scare the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of them  810 would rage on my friends all over againEarly Access ReviewHackers have taken over,negative

Obvious hacking going on streamers are allowed to use aimbots too Badly optimized Wouldn t recommend the game especially at it s current price until these things are resolved,negative

Game is pretty goddamn terrible Whole lotta Chinese which unfortunately means a whole lotta hackers There s also a bunch of pretty reasonable solutions but if you talk about those then you re a racist,negative
Its a good game Its still not entirely a complete game  kinda like rust none the less its still good all these pisspoor reviews are because a local edglord grouped a bunch of basement dwelles together ti bring the ratings down,positive
its not really well made its fun for a few hours but its incredibly basic there isnt much to do if you have played it once you have played it a thousand times or something like that I regret buying the game at 30 US dollars in my prediction I imagine that it will not really recieve any upgrades anything that makes the game better as it is that is how the game will most likely forever be what it is and if you likely clunky then Pubg has your chunkie or something like that its going to get really boring after a short time even if you stream it which in all reality still isnt that fun there are better places where you can spend money on steam,negative

Overall experience is good but recently i ve encountered alot of crashes ingame  3 times today thank god reconnect button existsReally nice game if you decent team   friends since i don t like solo playing that much They could implement 3v3 since playerbase is huge and playing with randoms isnt enjoyable experience all the timePros FPP servers are nice Looting system is good Realistic ish gameplayCons Crashing alot lately Could remove the useless clothing loot nobody cares about striped shirts when you have cosmetic crates already No 3v3 format Requires semi high pc to run decentlyWas it worth to spend 30 euros  For me yes altho game can get annoying if you end up dying after looting 10 minutes or not to find weapon on fightning area at start of the game Alternative games similar to this  H1z1 Kotk Fortnite,positive
2017steamcostafkThis is an awsome game fresh gaming machinisms get full of surprises in every match PUBG could be seen as the most successful game in 2017 However tons of cheating programs ruined the game it is not about whether PUBG is trying to fix the problem It is about the posssibility of fixing it the cost of cheating in this game is so cheap The steam refund policy made those players who cheat can get their money back so quickly even after their account is banned by PUBG PUBG has made a gigantic market that it could not possiblely manage to work on good online FPS game could not survive under cheating players if the company does not have the capacity of technics Every time when u report a player on cheating u feel like it is more like a self confort and nothing would happen to that player Not providing feedbacks made people feel that PUBG company itself has done nothing in preventing those cheaters keep cheating there is no list of banned players released at all I would AFK this game since today and personally do not recommand any new players to join this game not until the cheating problem fixedUpdate  It is not about how many times do you encounter cheaters in ten games now it is about how many do you encounter in one game,negative

Horrible optimizations questionable bans  for honking at streamers Instead of working on some key elements the devs try to bring out the final 10 version before 2018    but the game isn t even ready for it Horrible 17Hz tickrate  keep in mind people brag about CSGOs 64Hz tickrate so imagine this game Some pretty major problems like vehicle physics are still as bad as back when I got the game 4months ago Expect to meet a lot of cheaters too This game will not be a good and competitive game for me until it meets following requirements  which the game obviously won t till final version  rank system  I feel like I play against some of the best players but it might be my lack of skill still I want to make sure that I play against players with the same skill level 60FPS at all times  I get drops with a GTX 1070 and a Ryzen 5 1600 and this is considered a damn good system for 1080p gaming Wait for the final version Only get it if you plan on playing with friends for the fun The game itself is not that great H1Z1 seems to be a better alternativeEDIT  As of december 2017 this game is much better than every version before Consistent FPS a new map a lot of fixed bugs etc It s not quite bugfree or flawless but the improvement is huge I would go as far as saying that this is worth its price  you get your money back quick via ingame cratesEDIT 2  This game is still bad Cancerous tickrate in the earlygame of less than 10ticks makes it unplayable Cheaters are back  hit registration issues Honestly it surprises me how these LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers cannot fix issues that have esixsted fir months after selling so many copies of this game For LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s sake don t play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE EDIT 3  As of February 2018 this game has got worse over the course of the last few patches The lobby in the menu still doesn t work often enough to make my friends and me freak out Furthermore I ve been getting crashes consistently with a guessed percentage of 15 25  of all matches I play When I play random duos I end up alone more often than not if I even manage to get out of the loading screen Btw my specs are a R5 1600 GTX 1070 8GB RAM The game is installed on an SSD and my internet connection is flawless all running under a fresh copy of Windows 10 with no other programs showing simillar issues THis game has nearly been out for one LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing year yet it s still in this bad state Or as Trump would say  Sad,negative
Very buggy,positive
Would not reccomend this game in its current state Constant hackers with a rediculously usless ban system the Dev s say they are banning 20K players a day yet still getting killed daily by aimbotters an wall hackersOnce that gets fixed maybe will be playable but till then down vote,negative

Even I can run better than this game,negative
Cheaters seem to be in every match these days I previously had a good time with this game but it s a lot less satisfying when every match I m shot in the head at an impossible range while riding over rough terrain on a motorcycle at top speed by someone using as pistolI ve logged quite a few hours and been bested more times than I can count But it s only in the last month that it feels like this cheating problem has really taken off Until it s fixed I m not sure I can stand to play anymore,negative
This game is fun for like 2 hours then you get board of it Pros  Entertaining for like one hour without friendsOccasional wacky momentsGameplay can make you tense up at timesCons  Game becomes increadibly boring on your own after about 1 2 hoursDoing squad or duo matches with random players usually gets you someone without a mic some chinese player who constantly asks if you speak chinese or the occasional player with a mic who speaks englishChinese players come from Chine to American servers due to not having their own and lag out the game usually resulting in you dying unfairlySo yeah pubg bad game bro,negative

this game is so boring compared to h1z1 or fortnite ill play one game and ill run thorugh the map with one kill looking for poeple get amazing loot and then when there is 10 remain i finally find someone to fight and ill probably die to the crappy combat mechanics and wont be motivated to play anther and go to h1z1 and drop a 20k win and play for the next 5 hours  dont buy this game,negative
I love it,positive
This game is fun and awesome Too many cry babies This game is less than a year old and they are doing a great job getting it going Yes there are hackers and bugs and such but that doesn t ruin the experience People complain about disconnects and it not being optimized I play on a PC that is barely able to run it and I have very few problems I very seldom come across hackers when I do I die and start a new match No need to cry about it It s still better than any other shooter out right nowWELL WORTH THE 30,positive
Game is full of hackers plain and simple speed hacks aim bots etc until this is fixed dont play its not worth it,negative
Hackers Played this game for a while now and never heard of hacking Recently hackers are everywhere I mean everywhere playing a game and getting good loot only to get killed by a hacker with no chance of surving just gives this game a garbage experience The game is super fun with squads and without hackers is a toal blast but when one player takes out a squad with a pistol from 200m ruins it Wait until they fix the servers and get rid of the hackers to buy this game If you think hackers might not be that big of a deal just look at me write a review about how LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game is now because of it,negative
Ignore my hundreds of hours  It was awesome at the start always people speaking english zero cheatersNow the game is kinda garbage every game there are aimbots and usually zero people on your team speak englishAnd its getting worse by the day,negative
The hacking makes the game pointless More often than not games end in some guy making multiple headshots against your team in half a second at long distance Vaulting new maps etc are pointless until people who actually play the game fairly have a chance of winning again and not merely by the luck of joining an honest server,negative
Over 8 million buys and this game sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE  IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,negative
Amazing concept and gameplay  Problem is that there is an uptick in the amount of hacking going on where the leaderboards are infested with super high impossible kill ratios for number of games played and getting headshot from across the map has made this game unplayable  Tonight two games in a row on NA servers there was one hacker killing the entire serverit was only time before he got around to our squad and sure enoughheadshot  If Bluehole doesn t address this rampant hacking the competitive gameplay that I enjoyed earlier this summer through this early fall is gone and not worth playing anymoreI would recommend this game IF there was an adequate anti cheat system in place that removed the possibility that your efforts in game wouldn t be suddenly zeroed out by someone tilting the playing field in their favor every time you load into a matchAt this time I wouldn t tell friends to buy this early access game at this point  Hopefully by release this will have been addressed and we can go back to enjoying the legitimately competitive gameplay I ve experienced in the past,negative

Even though this game is in early access and there are issues I ve easily had more than 30 worth of fun I duo with a friend I rarely get to spend time with IRL and the duo servers are always either thrilling hilarious or we re just plain bad But the most important thing about this game is it s replay value every game is different and I d recommend it to anyone I know,positive

Too many hackers and bugs Please fix it all and optimize the game before adding new things to the game,negative
uninstalling wish i could get a refund now that you can get banned for using reshade after playerunown said it was ok but they dont do LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about chinese aimbot hacks etc bt you can get banned for using an app the only makes the game better maybe one day blueballs will make there graphics better so people dont use apps like reshade also if you want a br game just get fortnite its better in every way possible,negative
On a scale of 1 10 I d give it a one star It used to be a pretty decent game but as many of the reviews will tell you everytime you die you have to wonder  was that a legit headshot or are they running a hack   It has become blatantly more obviously lately as the hackers aren t afraid to openly display that they re runnig hacks Feel free to buy the game check out the leaderboards then request a refund Wouldn t waste 30 on this wouldn t play it for free in its current stateUpdate 1230 About 2 out of every 3 games are still going to be ended due to a cheater Game still isn t worth it  this is based on third person perspective though,negative
stop LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing about the game and appreciate what it has done for steam and the reputation of pc gaming as a wholei have not run into one hacker in this game in my life  NA  EU,positive

My Grandfather smoked his whole life I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him  If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate you have to stop immediately  Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake He gave it up immediately Three years later he died of lung cancer It was really sad and destroyed me My mother said to me   Don t ever smoke Please don t put your family through what your Grandfather put us through  I agreed At 28 I have never touched a cigarette I must say I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because your post gave me cancer anyway,positive
Seems like 9 out of 10 games you play you will encounter some type of player using an aimbotspeedhack or esp the game is fun but it has a serious problem with cheaters And it s getting worse as time passes before you would run into a cheater once in a while and be like wow that sucks but whatever and you would get over it However it s hard to get over it when it happens in every single match it seems And to make matters worse  We are currently banning at a rate of 6K 13K per day nearly 20K within the last 24 hours alone The vast majority is from China  that s from battleye And you got the devs saying that out of 50 games they ve never encountered a cheater so no wonder they dont seem worried about fixing it,negative
Full of bugs devs know its full of bugs yet they do nothing to fix them When it works properly it is a fun game but most of the times it is just a massive pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE  to try to get it not to crash or lose connection for long enough to launch a game let alone finish it,negative
Lots of greatness to this game  It s far from perfect but the most fun I ve had in a multiplayer in quite a whilePrimarily because it has a legit solo mode You can play by yourself and it all depends on you or play with a group and have a blast,positive
I have 90 hours so I feel I have to give this title a recommendation But there are definite hesitationsThe game is a buggy mess Server desync when loading into map makes the initial couple minutes of gameplay a jarring clunky mess Visual optimization after a year has not really improved most people have to play this title on low settings to get respectable frame rates or come even close to a consistent 144 frames  to enable the  new standard  144 hz gaming monitors The physics engine is still clunky as hell nothing like spending 40 minutes to have a bikecar flip for no god damn reason Audio sound queues are difficult to discern at the best of times All that said its one of the best BR games on the market That said you should try H1Z1 and Fortnite they are better optimized H1Z1 has a better pro scene and fortnite is freeallows for more creative cameplay elementsWorth trying but I feel a lot of players will drop this game in a year or so,positive
Perfect game ,positive

This is not a run and gun game If you don t believe me feel free to try You will either die immediately or find no action for about 10 minutes until you are suddenly gunned down with no idea where the bullets even came from Skill matters more than quick reaction times although having both helps You  can  win a game without any of your victims fighting back if you are cunning  and lucky enough Firearm and balistic mechanics are modeled quite well almost everything you would see IRL minus wind The guns fill their roles as they do IRL as well Consider which situations military and police use each firearm in and that will give you an idea of what you should be doing Of course you don t always have the luxury of choice When I do I opt for an close range UMP paired with a one of the autoloading center fire rifles for medium range engagements ideally an SKS or min14 if I can find one Long range is fun but often a waste of ammo and time as well as a quick way to reveal your location to everyone around youMy advise to noobs  don t drop in dense areas until you have some kills under your belt Once you find a decent gun find a good place to camp and spring traps on anyone in range This will get you actual experience as opposed to the mindless shooting you will find if you go to dense areas first Save that for later to test your new skills,positive
Totally trash game full of cheaters and the stupid anti cheat system I played more than 200 hours in this game and got banned suddenly for no reason I ve never hacked or even tried to They don t give me explanation for why i was banned No refund of course I m pretty sure I am innocent but nobody believes and cares about it By the way it is my last game produced by those stupid Korean game companies Hope you go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bankrupt soonSomething added on Mar 24th 2018 I don t know if you guys can see my comments as you look at this review So I just put it hereIf you want to know how I got unbanned I ve introduced my solution in previous comments that I just created a support ticket on their website Keep trying to talk to them and convince them that their anti cheat system is actually flawed because you did nothing wrong but finally you were treated as a cheater so they should do further investigation and improvement more importantly remove your ban of course Please don t try to add me to your friend list To be honest it s about every week I will receive a friend request asking me how I got unbanned I do not expect this will work for everyone every time but that s all I know and all I ve experienced true story,negative

It s a perfectly simplistic game and it s incredibly fun if you re into the battle royale style game mode  Has a lot of tech problems but none of them have been enough to make me stop playing  A lot of people like to whine about the game but most of it is hyperbole  It s a pretty solid game for an early access multiplayer deathmatch,positive

This game is poorly made People parachuting just appears out of nowhere Loot system is so crap one day you will find level 2 items everywhere next day you cant even find a level 1 backpack in 5 houses You will find ammo but no matching gun or attachments for smg s everywhere but no smg Overall this game sucks Not Worth your hard earned cash This game shouldve been free or even better Pubg Corp should pay you to play it Sound is unbalanced Cars are louder than gunshots Vehicle mechanics suck Cars flip for no reason crashes into invisble walls Vehicles spawn when you drive them without them there is no vehicles especialy outside the white circle Certain areas gets bombared by Red Zones other areas dont even smell one This Game is unbalanced AS FK,negative
This game is fun but very poorly optimized and full of bugs I am not at all convinced the developer is going to fix these terrible issues any time soon I cannot recommend this game,negative
The amount of hackers is too much and nothing is done about it I ve come across speed hacks self explanantory wall hacks   I am covered from the enemy but he shoot through the wall  aim bots  i got headshot 3 times in a row while running and jumping So I highly do not recommend playing until someting is done I mostly play in the Asia server an abundance of hacker,negative

there is way to many hackers still in the game and all they have to do is 5 extra to make another account there doing nothing to even remotley handle the hackers the game is constantly still glitchly as all hell and you can even really play over minimum graphics with two gtx 1080s,negative
Yall forgetting this game is in EARLY ACCESS,positive
So many hackersAnd a lot of them are ChineseNow a day at Chinese net cafe It is shame of installed PUBG with no basic cheating toolsAs for advanced cheating software like Forcehacking  gathering other player around 500m at specified location by forced or airpunching  kill you in airplane by punch are worth hundreds of dollers a month  Rented account to use hacking softwareNo one will use cheating software if he is well educatedBut China can not provide passable education until 1977 by some reasonThat is only 40 years about three or four generation China is growing fast on economy and some other areaBut only good education and time can make people better insideSorry about that and we will be better,positive

With over 400 hours on the game I feel people just starting should get a headsup 1 SOOOOOOOOOOO many hackers There are hacks out there right now being advertised that they are undetectable and only 25 and they work PUBG knows about this and they do not care You can report someone for cheating but PUBG does NOTHING about it 2 Their nat code needs serious work Theres no reason I should be shooting at someone who has level 1 gear hit them 6 times they turn around and shoot me once while I have level 2 gear Doesn t matter the gear their nat code is off I have videos of me in level 3 gear and getting shot one time and dying after putting a clip into someone with level 1 gear3 The vehicle psychics are ridiculous I ve been with this game from the beginning and they have made NO effort to fix the vehicle system Driving a bike is pretty much suicide as you can hit a pebble in the road and the bike goes flying and you die They also have a ton of invisible walls around the map that vehicles run into and of course you take damage from  ie like transitioning from grass to a road  4 They have made adjustments to AFKs however they have missed the most simpliest of fixes for afks Don t auto release the parachute Releasing the parachute should be a manual thing AFKs won t deploy their chutes and will die on impact Also who says I can t release my parachute late to get down first   If I take a bit of damage who cares If i want to get down first and release the chute 50 feet from the ground I should be able to Taking away the auto deploy of the parachute would solve all the afk problems Such a simple fix missed by the devs 5 The server performances have improved however you make 500 million on your game before it s even released the FIRST thing you do is upgrade your hardware ANY IT company knows this Yet they are continuously having server issues that is most liking caused by the overabundance of people playing Simply upgrading your servers will improve the server performances drastically  My bachelors in networking tells me this It will also help with point 2  the nat code6 The third person shooting is off When holding the right mouse button to third person aim or just freely aiming the aim is off You have to set the crosshairs to the left of the person in order to hit them This is due to the POV in the game design The cursors are off Even when you have the cursors directly on someone you can see the bullets go through them and hit the wall behind them or whatever Again this is the NAT code but the fact that the most basic thing for third person  aiming is off is pretty sad I appreciate the concept of the game FPS players and TPS players have been waiting for a game like this for a while They are so close to being the SERVICE they want however if you are trying to create a SERVICE the most important thing of that service is the CLIENTS you are presenting it to If it s a piece of crap the clients won t appreciate it and watching the ratings for this game tank the last few months tell me they really need to rethink their gameplan and stop trying to run before you crawl  ie tournments NVIDIA intergrations new maps Fix the issues before you expand the game You ll find you ll have more backers I can t recommend this game at this time,negative

I LOVED this game I ve put 135 hours into it But key word  loved  past tense The cheating and hacking has become so rampant that the game is literally unplayable There is nothing you can do people running as fast as vehicles and automatic headshots There s no point in playing the game if they can just auto kill you That s not even the full list of issues Desyncing is rampant server lag makes looting impossible and there are tons of glithces getting stuck in the geometry of things and random damage glitches,negative

This game is full of bugs and issues  The company behind it has earned 100s of millions but they can t figure out how to prevent the game from crashing all the time  Weak,negative
IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THIS GAME JUST WAIT UNTILL THE GAME IMPROVES BECAUSE THE COMPANY ISNT DOING JACK LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  RIGHT NOW TO FIX ANY OF THE PROBLEMS I would BARELY recommend the game in its current state because the loot is not the best seeing as some of the buildings will have ARs and SRs in them but the other ones will literally have nothing at all in them so you get killed by a guy with a scar while u have a sickle the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE  atm because the response time of the button press to the action is so late that it is just incredibly terrible lastly the first person servers fix a bit that third had problems with like people not showing themselves but they still lay in the grass and play like the biggest LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i have ever seen in any game,negative
Many times i didn t know the enemies even until i was killed It s really awful,positive
Stupid arbitrary meta rules Never would have bought the game in the first place if I knew about them No emergent gameplay for you I don t even know why you re allowed to talk to other players if you get banned for doing anything other than shooting them,negative
Runs 55 80 fps 90 percent of the time on a budget build Just put everything on very low except anti alisaing on high textures to whatever and render distance low to mediumSpecs  GTX 1050           Ryzen 5 1400           8 gigabytes of ddr4 ramIt s fun but sometimes you can go into a game and not see anything for 20 minutes and then get shot out of nowhere Controls are weird and a little bit constricting But it s fun to rage and play with friends and go into a big town with a shotgun,positive

Bad frame rates even for GTX 1070 1080p The development doesn t seem to get any progress done on optimizing the game for stability Lots of crashing The GUI is so sh tty the play button is even in HTML The game has so much lag compensation it causes desync issues Servers keep crashing and seem to be only rented Amazon servers For a company that generated so much revenue from millions of sales they still can t seem to afford their own servers or even optimize their game but instead focus on  new content ,negative

What s good about the game   the game modeWhat s bad about the game   very bad netcode The game has a tickrate of 8Hz  very bad optimisation   no restriction for china market like most steam games do   lots of cheaters  nothing is being done to prevent obvious hacks such as speed hacks   inexperienced dev team  no cheater report function in gameAnd many many more wrong things with the game The only reason to play this game is because there s no other game that does battle royale better YET,negative
Great  Battle Royale  game with its mechanics and graphics The right tweaks of the settiings and your FPS can increase Everythign about the game is amazing very playable even with a bottleneck CPU has the odd few bugs such as when parachuting and getting stuck inside a building or landing on a roof and gliding off and losing health R I P but for the 28 Hours I have on the game I love the experience,positive

Wow so from just quickly looking through the reviews a lot of people are saying this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and sucks and whatever else Now I will say that this game is nowhere near perfect but it s also still in early access so I don t expect it to be polished yet Overall I would recommend this game to anyone simply because it is extermely fun to play both alone and with friends The gunplay is a little weird at times and certain guns feel like they have a little bit too much recoil but as you play more you will find the guns you like and avoid the ones you don t This game has a rather high skill curve as it isn t hard to be good but to be amazing it will take a lot of time and playing,positive

The main reason is that Bluehole are being DISRESPECTFUL to their users who bought the game Making tons of promises and either doing some 1 ultra small update in a month or doing nothing at all After many days  even months and many many funds that Bluhole gained they are still can t improve their game to make it at lease PLAYABLE Too much bugs NO optimization  i ts laggy on Intel i7 5700 Nvidia 965 M with LOWEST graphics which is not so good even on ultra connection problems shutdown problems VERY and VERY slow updating  i can t even feel it after few months of playing PUBG They said they will release the game until the end of 2017 but i just can t imagine how they are goind to do this with SO MUCH problems that game still has If they will still release it it won t be a full and released game anyways so 1 to disrespecting us That s sad However the game has a potential to become something big and impressive since the gameplay and emotions i got from it was perfect sometimes I REALLY hope that Bluehole will start to work super hard and intensive to make PUBG a completed game Until that happen i NOT RECOMMEND buying this game to anyone,negative

I just played a game with my friend we were doing good and yet the server kept disconection So after that the server crashed and we were taken out of the lobby we were able to get back in only to be lagging horribly and we lost the match because the server was lagging very badly and the last dude alive wasnt even good We would have won that game if it didnt crash I DON T RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE,negative

Honestly This game is great It s little things that need to be fixed No bugs that I can recall make things game breaking and if you have some friends to play with you ll get lost playing this game Great game would recommend to anyone looking for a fun game Although they do need to work on some optimization issues I run a GTX 1060 with 8gb RAM and an i7 processor and my buildings won t load in by the time I hit the ground If you dont have the best computer I probably would save your money or look at game s minimum requirements,positive

Was killed by a car that didnt make any noise Game requires map variety Most players go to the same spot  school military base prison etc Players who drop on less contested areas tend to camp out till the endNetwork LagCrouch jumping is essential but is extremely difficult to do especially for new playersHit registration sometimes comes quite late sometimes So if you are hit a few times without getting any health deductions you can make it to cover only to see you health bar go down suddenly and die,negative

I know this is gonna get terrible feedback from all the blind hypetrain SheepleSo I have played since the release of early access and I have to say it hasn t really improved by muchInstead of bug fixes  eg ram leak is still existing since the closed beta or some major improvements we got micro transactions and esport events It is just ridiculous how clearly you can see the intentions of Bluehole aka Blueballs Entertainment  MAKE MORE MONEYYYYY111 For serious this game has the worst netcode hitreg graphics resource management etc etc of all games released in 2017So you pay a copious amount of money for a overhyped  early access  games with devs obviously too lazy to fix bugs like the default AS server setting and you get the following paleo age technologies  This Game doesn t even have a proper UI it just loads a javascript in an ingame browser 10 Tick Servers have fun with the hitreg worst vehicle physics ever POINT You get run over with 3 kmh by your motorcycle  Feel free to just die    A truckload full of  mainly Chinese hackers that ruin your games Keep in mind that one hacker can ruin half an hour for 99 other guys Blueballs isn t doing very much about this beyond their  hard   Hahahaha effort there still are thousands of hackers on every server Just look at the leaderboards xThere is so much wrong with this game you d have to build it freshly from the scratch if you don t want anymore of this bugloaded spaghetti code with terrible really terrrible game mechanics It feels like playing a game from 1995 in terms of stuttering compared to a AAA ShooterThe only good thing about this horrendous experience of a game is the gameplay the Battle RoyaleSo we just have to wait for some AAA company to actually make a good Batlle Royale game with smooth and more bugfree experience  English is not my native language so Sheeple I couldn t care less if you start to Grammar Nazi me xI forgot to mention that this game runs terribly sometimes i only get 50 fps on the lowest settings at 1440p  1080 Ti i7 5820K 45 GHz this game is just ridiculously bad coded,negative

Gee Just in the past last week has hacking become very apparent especially in solo matches I m not talking  suspicious  or really on the fence maybe hacking im just bad and whatever you would like to call it We re talking full tilt sniping with a SKS switched to auto scoring head shots from  players named jainxi123420 or aaaaabbbbbbbCurrently I cannot recommend this to anyone looking to be king the island without being carried by a squad This was my experience with 5 out of 6 games with a Chinese  or falseflagger hacker wiping out the whole island full tilt farming BPNow I know this is either going to go two ways  1 Nothing will happen cause bluehole already has their funbux and the playerbase is so large that not enough will cry wolf as I have2 Ban waves will address the problem but reactionary as opposed to being really proactive They probably farm way faster than the actual usefulness of wave banningPretty basic idea for a game thats fun and quick and addicting that ballooned so hard that hacking for me has killed it,negative

The game has now launched and the instance of hackers in the top 1 and 2  of the player base is disgusting Can not give a positive review when we are getting hip fire head shot by awm s and im not saying like 1 freak shot i mean like 4 headshots in a row from the hip at more than 100 metres at some point your game is not competitve and is kind of a joke if in the top 1 and 2  of players there are constant hackers Deal with the problem bluehole,negative
i dont have this game what,positive
this game scared me so much i cryed ow,negative
Honestly the game is a waste of time to buy at this time Wait until the game is stable  after more than 12 months people still get trapped in their parachutes and wait until Blueballs understands precisely why people like Fortnite  Hint  It s not just because they do events Here s some random cons to the game   In the recent event you might spawn in with Minis VSS SKS multiple lives in a row all while enemies have M4s Scars AKs LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing great These guys have no idea about what makes Fortnite events interesting Out of all the events thus far all have been LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Shotguns only  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you   You get stuck on pebbles and other random pieces of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on the ground Oh is that can of soda too high for me to walk over  Right I forgot my character is obese Can t get my scooter over the dirt LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Take out the trash through the map Either make a multiplayer shooter or make a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  single player shooter where LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  blow their loads at the textures and stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  laying around that they think looks coolauthentic,negative

More than 300 hours in and this is what I got  Vaulting mechanics that could help tackle the house camping problem got delayed and never came out I guess they are just taking their time to make sure it s perfect  Optimization got better but still poor as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a sure as hell well funded game  But hey it is still in early access  Awful servers with massive delays  Wellthe game is popular af and everyone in the world is playing sounderstandable  Maybe   Speed hack aimbots wall hack every 1 out of 10 matches Erit happens with games   4 out of 10 matches  Wellagain it s a very popular game    9 out of 10 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing matches 20 people left in the server when the second blue zone hasn t even start closing in yet  WELL LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I M OUT OF SYMPATHY ,negative
Great idea but poorly executed Really poor optimisation and has issues that Dev s just doesn t seem to care but apparently  stream sniping  is more important for them than optimisation of a game,negative

Was a great game but the servers are terribly overloaded leading to horrendous performance You can be standing completely still with a sniper and shoot center mass at someone who is standing completely still 200yrds and miss half your shots Is there a railing in between you and your enemy  Forget about it  watch in amazement as your bullets make impact marks in midair Did you drop nearby someone and get to a gun first  Too bad  you re probably going to lose the RNG roll on how much lag you have making it take 5 10seconds to pick up a gun and a single clip giving your opponent plenty of time to blast your brains out If the devs ever fix all the problems with this game I m sure it will be great  but until then be prepared to spend half the rounds dying to the game malfunctioning,negative
See the concept even the gameplay is funBut considering its still in early access no improvements what so ever optimization and gameplay wise makes me give this game a thumbs downSee i thought the Developer of this game hated how games were Early Access and just a cash grab unpolished and see his game its in the same state as the other Battle Royale type gamesI will only give this game an upvote when it is fully realeased and it is polished way more Made in unreal engine 4 but feels like arma engine,negative
Server tick rates that are supposed to be to be 60 caps at 30  if there is less than about 15 people and generally maintains at about 5 10 during main stages of the game  Nother better than sitting behind a building after dodging fire to still end up being killed  1010 would die to 10 second delay again,positive

I ve been playing this game for atleast 1328 hrs at the moment and heres my pros and the consPros This game is fun in general You meet strangers   sometimes can be very salty or just basically toxic but most of them they are very friendly and gives you motivation of winning the game PUBg is an amazing game and I will not stop playing it and I will support it till the endCons  HackersThanks for making an amazing game Bluehole  ,positive
you can literally run up a 90 degree slope Fun with friends and memetastic 9910,positive
Love this game Kinda hard to get in to when you are just starting If you like intense PvP that s very skill based it s a great game,positive
my only gripe with this game has to do with the fact that its still early acess and has a few bugs,positive
I really like PUBG I really do But I still cannot believe how popular this game is The game is buggy as all hell and runs like absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  even on my pretty decent setup The gunplay is really good though and it s just amazingly fun to play some rounds with friends and troll each other with stuff like grenades and such I just hope they keep supporting the game for quite some time because that s also one of the things I can see becoming a problem in the near future Still really fun game but look out for the buggy mess you are getting into,positive
its really fun but the cheaters and hackers are so dumb like if you cheat your probaly going to win but then you get banned so its not worth it i give it a 710,positive
Badass Game GG DayZ   KOTK,positive

One of the most fun games you can play right now it s very competitive while still retaining the fun factor and it s not very stressful as compared to other competitive games such as CSGO Dota 2 etc in the sense that there is no rank there is a rank system but it s not very important and I hope it continues to do so it s not there for bragging rights it s just there to group players in the same skill level so you don t get matched with high level players that often Yes there are leaderboards if you re into that super competitive stuff but for most players it s just a fun game to playProbably most of you know already what the game is about it s a basically deathmatch game just with some added twists All 100 players can drop anywhere throughout the map depending on the trajectory of the plane randomized then find loots that spawns in houses and buildings randomized again and the radiation free zone slowly becomes smaller and smaller force the players to eventually meet up and kill each other The last man or team when in duo or squad modes standing wins For those who have not played it yet the game may seem very repetitive from descriptions and videos but it s really not The map is big so you get to drop at different places every match the circle closes in on a random spot every single round loots are random so basically everything in the game is dynamic and unpredictable You don t know where it will start and endIt also got that DayZArma 3 vibe going on which many people liked minus the bugs and the engine limitations those games has a lot of people played DayZ in this style  get some loot then kill some people get more loot kill more people This is basically THAT experience it just removes the dead parts of that game running for hours to meet up with a friend getting lost in the map lots of empty houses to loot etcDon t get turned off by that Early Access tag it s very much playable even when it was first released I got it early There are occasional connection issues every now and then most likely due to the HUGE number of players in the game it s not bad though it means the game is very much alive and you can easily find games anytime btw finding games is easy you just click play and most of the time you get to a lobby of around 70 players by the time the timer ends it s around 90 players and the game starts when you die you can quit and just find a new game almost instantlyAlso about the  loot crates  issue it s not a big deal It s just cosmetics if someone wants to play lots of money for an in game skirt let them be it s even more easier to spot them when actually playing the gameThe devs are also actively improving the game they even plan to add a new map and a new vaulting system It accomplished something DayZ have failed to do in many years of it s early accessScore  9510,positive

Bluehole have become what is my least favorite dev team ever PUBG is a game that at the core is fun and worth your money however I can t endorse a purchase of the game with the lack of updates communication and proper meta changes After a certain amount of time the game becomes progressively less funBluehole needs to take responsibility for the change in the quality and frequency of updates make an effort to visit the popular online discussion boards and reply to the community and outline their thoughts rather then give announcements with little to not contextThis game is plauged with issues as a player that has hit top 1000 multiple times I feel that things such as offset ACOG offset 8x and audio bugs are detrimental to the competitive aspect of the game This as well as the devs refusal to listen to the community about guns that are criminally underpoweredAdditionally going back on promises such as adding paid crates to the game is unacceptable PUBG is setting a record that a fun game bypasses ethics and it s okay to ignore the things that should be core to a studio and frankly as a game dev this upsets me very muchLast but not least the lack of updates has made the meta rather stale We need to see more guns added into the game and it d even be pretty neat to see them rotate per game so that the meta changes per game The meta has grown to be rather stale and this game has lost all notion of tension that made me once love it,negative
I bought this game and it sucks Deffenitly worse than H1Z1 Not only are the game mechanics LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but also EVERYTHING about this game is copied from H1Z1 I wasted 40 on this game and I suggest you shouldn t either Instead of wasting 40 go spent half that on H1Z1 for a fun time,negative

Playerunknow s NameIsSheit is a bad game that somehow gained a huge following because some popular people liked it and people are mindless dronesIt is an unrewarding experience matches play out the same every single round and the developers are not even able to provide a stable 60fps If you wanna play Battle Royale games play Fortnite  if not power to youThis video will give in depth insight into why PUBG is sheit https wwwyoutubecomwatch vG4XFMDikC5k,negative
Nothing is more satisfying than tricking 4 people to walk into a room with bodies in the door way and stealing their gearOn the other hand it s not fun to jump on the same building in a seperate match with 10 people only to feel like the hunger games just started and having 4 people shoot it out on the roof with the 2 remaining ones trying to kill you Thus having to jump 3 stories down into a courtyardhide for 10 minutes only to try and loot a body in the gym where someone tries to shoot you and dying shortly after due to poor aim when you ve got the drop on some poor LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in the hallway,positive

tis pretty good It would be helpful if they addded a recommended system requirments though Other than that it s a good game,positive
Great game unfortunately with a dire flaw This game is normally very very fun and with tons of weapons and versatility providing a immersive large Battle Royale map with many options and opportunities However As of the past month or so It has more hackers than The War Z and Combat Arms combined Anybody can look at the very recently released leaderboards and see the names with countless numerical or asian characters with unrealistic stats 7km traveled on foot in 17 games with 17 wins 800 kills in 23 games half headshots Etc Once they improve the anticheat I will return but it is almost unplayable at the moment,negative
This game is realy great but i think of 1 winner out of 100 they should at least make every one know in the game how did win and show his name and chracter and may be the last 10 be able to spctate the rest of the players so they can see who will make it to the chicken dinner,positive

This game is a shooter at it s core but is part of a genre called Battle Royale where you have to keep in a designated area and loot for guns and other equipment to kill other players until you or your team are the last ones standing The gameplay is a solid experience great shooting mechanics the seemingly constant movement having to move between cities compounds fields forests and barren deserts all so you can stay alive before that blue zone is about to get you it s great The feelings I have in the game are just so mixed I can go from calm to crazy in 1 second when I hear someone trying to snipe me from afar and all I have is a shotgun looking through a house and hearing footsteps right outside going through a destructive redzone of constant explosions thinking  oh sh t I m going to die f ck f ck  having in the back of my mind that the blue zone is coming and I need to run faster and so much more Another great thing is the loot system in the game In order to get good loot you should go to high risk areas where many players go or go for Care Packages that are fought over to get rare items or you could go to a random compound and get mediocre loot and kill other players along the way to get better stuff Although the gameplay is just one of the best experiences I ve ever had there s so much wrong with how this game is treated For one cheaters are destroying everyone s experience on this game and it seems that not much is being done about it I can t be too critical of this because there are major ban waves done frequently plus this is one of the most popular games ever but I m sure something more could be done Another downside is the bugs driving and randomly clipping to the floor exploding for example Bugs are fixed all the time but there s new ones it seems all the time Overall the gameplay is fantastic but the problems basically can somemost of the time destroy itProsGreat Shooting MechanicsRecoilSpray ControlBullet DropBreathing for AccuracyWide variety of weapons to choose fromGame MovementAlways on the move never have to stay still for longProbably because I can t a playzone will be marked on the map which you need to get it if you don t a blue wall will close in until you are in the playzone it will damage you and towards the end of the game the blue wall will only take seconds before you re deadLooting and Item SystemIn order to get good loot you need to go to high risk areas with many players or go for Air Drops that have many players going for them to get rare itemsGoing for random compounds and sheds will only give you low level loot although not many people will be with youDifferent guns and equipment will do different things for example an Assault Rifle with a high rate of fire and low recoil like the M416 will do better and be more valuable then a 9mm SubmachinegunMany different weapons to find including Assault Rifles like the M416 AKM and OTs 14 Groza Sniper Rifles like the Kar98k SKS and M24 Many different items of equipment to use like first aid kits kevlar vests helmets and grenadesTeamworkIf playing in a team mode like Squads or Duos it is required you have good team coordination and communicationFor example saying  enemy  isn t as effective as saying  Enemy North 15 300 meters  to show your Squad exactly where the enemy isConsCheatersHackersExploitersMany games I play have many hackers and cheaters which ruin everyone s experience more measures should be made to get rid of themBugsMany vehicle bugs cars feel clunky to drive and will often explode for unexpected reasonsPhysics in this game aren t real I ve experienced dropping items and they clip through the floor so much I can t pick them upParachuting down can feel like your hallucinating Clipping everywhereMany more I can t think ofMy Rating  7510,positive
If you like a large scale battle royale game with lots of potential on the long run I think it s safe to say PUBG is the best right now It might not satisfy every type of gamer but it sure is fun and immersive The game is a rough diamond which already has a large community and active gameplay As a casual gamer I recommend to try it s versatile gameplay,positive
played 3 games on NA server this afternoon and met 2 aimbot hackers This game is now full of hackers while Bluehole doesn t care it at all Hackers publicly use and advertise for hacking software in the game  which I will explain belowNothing Bluehole can do but just start to develop a new game before they even  release  this game                                                                                                         I am familiar with Mandarin and pinyin so here I m gonna exlpain the meaning of those names you guys would often see on the leaderborad WG  Wai Gua    hacking softwareKJ  Ke Ji    Technology  hacking tech you knowFZ  Fu Zhu    Assistant  hacking assist you knowQqun  QQ qun  QQ  Tencent QQ groupchat the number after  qun  is the groupchat ID  that s where you contact them and buy hacking software,negative
you search for a match you land you find good loot you dont see a single player for a good solid 20 minutes you die  REPEAT ,negative
Thx for mailru,negative
Now I completely understand the game is fun but the actions taken from the developers is just shameful I would recommend waiting on this game until the promised progress has been made and the major issues have been fixed If you want an early access game get Subnautica If Bluehole gets your money they lose the incentive to make the game any better,negative
niceaddictive dont buy very good,positive
Very Dank,positive
The requirements needs an update Or the devs have to do their work better at reducing the rendering intensety This game needs a GTX 960 atleastPlay H1Z1 instead Same price on LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

The game was fun really was But the way they handle streamers and cheaters is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing embarassing Damn shameNot to mention it s barely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing playable with frequent crashes and garbage netcode Funny that they set out to be better than their competition and do things differently but they do the exact same LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and aren t any betterEdit  Encountering chinese aim assist players is now a common occurence getting em about every other game now Game needs to be region locked devs need to get a better anti cheat try using steam s vac systemEdti  Riddle me this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  How am I going to communicate to teammates who don t speak the same language as me  Region lock is common sense,negative

Not even close to Fortnite which is free,negative
Fortnite is free and does the battle royale genre better and more originally Bluehole is sueing anyone that looks at them wrong and hoping to win the lawsuit lottery Last time i checked multiple lawsuits against competing games isnt how you fix your janky and stuttering netcode mess,negative
The game is not for everyone And it s still in development process towards a better state In my opinion this game did something right in terms of feelings of realism Maybe due to ballistic weapon mechanics surroundings and various situations Every gun is unique in its own way which gives you more and more immersion in the game PROS  Super realistic  Great graphics  Kills feel so rewarding more than any other games  Looting system is a 1  Improving company from a small one  Regular updates  Incredibly fun playing with friends  A great FPSTPS game to say the least  Always a exciting moment to read patch notes unlike other gamesCONS  Frame rates might be rough   Desync at times  TPP still vulnerable to mass hackers  Silent changes sometimes in updates  Rewards feel a bit meh due to microtransactionsThough it s worth mentioning that the developers are working hard to address the issue with the cons I mentioned The company is growing at an immense rate and will only continue to move forward from now on They might take some time to adjust but PUBG will get to the  stable  state in the near future,positive
i first found the game fun and enjoyable but as far it goes players team up in solo match fight  please do ban those idiots,negative
THIS game from best WENT to HORRBILE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  2 3 cheaters every gameTop leadearboards are full of cheatersdont even need to proof anythingDevelopers are only making money with no investment in the game to make it comfortableGame is unplayeble anymore want to get my money backThis is rediculousPosting my reviews anywhere i can,negative
Finally PlayerUnknown got his own game and he goes big with it Twitch can tell you how popular it is and many will tell you it is very similar to H1Z1 or Fortnite or ARMA 3  Battle Royale but PUBG plays very differently and proves a very different type of experience The skill gap is huge when it comes to gun skill but what I love about the game is that smarts are just as or even more important than gun skill You can win games with only 1 kill if you play stealthy enough or if you are gun skilled enough you can drop 20 bombs and win the gameHowever this game is buggy as all hell and the developers while very passionate seem very incompetent sometimes Because I see so much dedciation and passion behind this team though despite their flaws I m going to recommend this game because I think it will only improve significantly with time and those that bought the game won t regret itIt is not eSports ready despite whatever the developers tell you Like I said they are passionate and definitely creative but not the most talented dev team out there,positive

not really worth it at the moment soon as you buy it play it then try to re open it doesnt load hopefully in the future this game will be better but for now i wouldnt recommend it,negative
The game would be good if there wasnt a huge lag difference between players and chinese hackers in every 3rd match fix your game all i ever see is bluehole complaining about people copying them when they wernt even the first to come up with battle royale concept,negative

This game is full of hackers No fun at all,negative
Until this game figures out a better way to deal with hackers  Mainly Speedhacking but ive seen some aimbotters as well I cant recommend it Solo play is where you are going to meet to the majority of the hackers There is very little point in playing solo as it seems that 3 out of 4 games I get a speedhacker and once its the final 10 they run around and score headshots on everyone in 30 seconds If you can play with friends in squad or duo the hacking seems to not be as rampant there Avoid solo if you can help itEdit  Even Duos and squads are getting bad for hackers,negative
one of the most overhyped games of all timeBoring combat and repetitive garbGG,negative
Before you press buy ask yourself if there is literally anything else you want to put 30 towards in your lifeLike putting it towards a pc that can run it,positive
It s a bad game but I keep playing it,negative
aaa,negative
I d recommend this game if it weren t for the fact that you can t win anymore no matter how well it s going there s always going to sit a cheater gunning you down in two seconds in some bush 5km away,negative
I didn t use to like FPSTPS games before I still don tBut I have lots of friends that play this game and it is as fun as it can get So even if you don t like these games but have lots of friends who can play this with you BUY THE GAME DONT EVEN THINK If you don t like it just get a refund,positive
Just so so,negative
Just reset the server,positive
This game is a new ish concept and fun with friends The game gets your heartbeat up as your fighting to win in a clutch situation giving you a great feeling of relief when you see  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  pop up on your screenHowever PUBG is far from perfect It has many problems which seem rather small and insignificant when you start playing But after a while when you die to bug 8241 for the third time and realised you ve wasted 30 minutes looting to get stuck in a fence it gets old fast I ll list the main problems belowLoot takes time to load when you land meaning you look one way see nothing turn back to where you looked 3 seconds later and theres a guy picking up a shotgun and loading itQuestionable vehicle physics Im looking at you motorbike  but i m still looking at all other vehiclesVehicle exploding on slight contactVehicle sound bugs my buddy can hear the buggy we just parked but I can tParachute physics  Generally good but not alwaysMain menu  works most of the time but pretty atrociousDoor physicsServer desyncRed zone killing you inside buildings when I m standing away from windows and doorsHeavy random FPS drops when all options are set on low i5 4690k  42GHz 16GB RAM SSD and GTX 970 no excuse other than poor optimisationAt this time I can t recommend PUBG at the moment it needs patches and fixes,negative

Game used to be LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing amazing until the devs LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ran off with all our money There hasnt been a update for this game in forever The game is buggy asf Apparently having a gtx 1080 ti makes you only have 70 fps on all low and the hit reg is complete garbage It takes 5 kar98   one of the most powerful rifles in the game to kill an enemy that is downed They literally took our money and ran off with it I do not reecommended buying this game at all,negative

Let me start by saying I absolutely love this game the dev team have put in the work and are continuing to do so with every udate that has came out so far keep up the great work For those of you who are complaining about lag or frame drops i play at 1080p with a R9 290  and a i5 2500k and get between 70 100 fpsSmooth as butter tweak out the right settings and you should be right in theresettings for me are Textures on ULTRA View distance on ULTRA  Everything else on lowGo get the game watch a youtube video if needed or talk to some friends to help you tweek it and there should be no reason for you not to get over 30fps   with the minimum recomended settings for the game itself  FUN FUN FUN       CHICKEN DINNERS ARE US    GET THE GAME AND HAVE A BLAST ,positive
Too many bugs,positive
PUBG is well an okay gameAlthough it s very very fun to play it has many flaws mostly its optimisation The whole excuse of  early access  is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t in my opinion This game has the funding of a triple A game so I will treat it as thatExcept from that the gameplay is amazing and fun although losing can be upsetting it isn t deal breaking or rage worthy I say the game has many things to do before it really is considered a  good game In its current state the game is worth its asking price and I think that many people would enjoy this game albeit its issues  Do note this game isn t for you if you can t stand losing as that will happen a lot,positive
There are mutiple points to why this game is bad One of the main points is movement I ve spent around 25  Of my time during a game trying to Jump over a wall It s so badThe combat is complete and utter one sided Oh you ve been spotted first  Yeah you re deadOh he has a sight and you don t Oh yeah you re dead The game was fun for the first day or two Now it s just a chore for me to play with my friends Nobody likes chores I would not recommend buying this game unless it s on sale It s a complete waste,negative
If you enjoy dropping through invisible buildings that never load in getting 4 shots on someone that never registered because the server is several years behind what s happening on your client or just doing things that make you want to die in general then this is the game for you  I ve played 5 hour games of Monopoly that were less aggrivating than this steaming pile of trash  yet I still keep playing  I don t know if that says more about me or the game  Do not play this game unless you completely hate yourself in which case prepare for an exciting and fulfilling hacker filled experience,negative
Too many hackers There isn t a report player option either so we just have to hope the devs are actually doing something,negative

glitchy as hell i played it a lot but then me and friends got auto canceled after refreshishing the ui in game and trying over ten times and i can safley say after the last update Dont Buy,negative
This is my favorite game and will be for some time if you re looking for a FPP or TPP shooter where you battle 100 other people this is the best you ll get there are so many fun things to try and within the battleground the game is perfect in my opinion I have 6 wins in 200 hours and many many top 10 s everytime you get in the top 10 you get a rush of excitement  as you look around for people to either avoid or kill You can play with 1 friend or 3 friends so you can have fun nights with your friends I highly recommend this game for anyone to buy since before I bought it I thought it looked bad and clunky but it s not at all it s better than 90  of games,positive
Ever seen something roll down a hill  No  That s okay because you ve seen it now,negative
Even though this is one of the most played games on steam its also one of the worst when it comes to servers Honestly not sure if the development team has been on vacation for 4 months or theyre just swimming in too much money to care Youre lucky if you can connect to the servers and even when youre in them theyre garbage and the lagglitches are unbearable This game has went from charming and tacticle to just plain stupid Dont even care about the vaulting anymore How do i get a refund  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT NO ONE WHO RUNS THE GAME IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM AND THE ONLY NEWS ARTICLES THAT EXSIST ARE FULL OF POSITIVITY THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING THIS IS SQEEZING THE CONSUMER TO PAY 3699 FOR AN EARLY ACCESS MESS,negative
Must have Fixed a lot of stuff lately so my guess is it will become even more enjoyableHighly reccommended   maybe bring some friends,positive
Have fun playing with friends,positive
very good game fun with friends,positive
tl dr  Too many cheaters and chinese dont keep to their own serversPUBG is honestly the best pvp game ive ever owned on pc but the one thing i cant stand more than anything is the amount of hackers i come across I m not talking once in a blue moon either I m talking at least once every 2 or 3 games my most recent death was attributed to a lovely chinese citizen running like the flash never missing a shot and firing a supressed M16A4 as if it were a M249 with infinite ammo Two games before i was sniped by someone who both threw a grenade and firing a Kar98k while walking on water Several news articles have claimed that BattlEye has banned over 320000 cheaters and hackers but what about the hundreds of thousands of others  It s made the game very unenjoyable and something needs to be doneSecondly ping locking needs to become a feature in this game for the sole reason that is the overwhelming chinese population in OC EU and NA servers their 200 ping makes for very frustrating moments when you clearly enter a walled off room with no windows and you still get hit by what would have seemed very legitimate from the other end a sharp shooter with an ARSo with the cheaters  who are predominantly chinese btw and the chinese bleedout this game has become rather disappointing and I severely hope that the full release will be a lot fairer to the average gamer,negative

You mustn t listen to the negative reviews as they are almost all some triggered chinese kid who can t pay a little extra for the game to run at full functionality  if its really a huge issue move out of a communist country and they are upset that Bluehole paired up with whoever they didPUBG has one of if not the highest amount of sales on steam and the highest concurrent player markIt is probably one of the most fun games on steamWith 1439 hours of gameplay since the launch of PUBG I can say from the bottom of my heart Buy this game its worth 30 dollars ,positive
PUBG helped me learn chinese in a week,positive
Katniss would be proud  I hope Out of all the arena style shooters PUBG is by far the best However that doesn t mean it doesn t have flaws It has a tonRecently the game has had some interesting marketing choices and poor playerbase treatment  ie banning  stream snipers  who weren t actually stream snipingIt is hard to recommend at 30 however because the game does not offer a lot in the customization market without spending money or grinding  which if you enjoy that then to each their ownPersonally I sometimes see myself jumping back into PUBG to play a round or two and then quit They definitely need to fix the optimization however I would like to run this game 1440p144hz but I mean I don t make the game,positive
Honestly one of the trashiest games I ve ever played Running into so many hackers and they re relentless One of  em didn t even start until there were like 20 or so people left and then just started eating everyone with the SKS  really just wasted everyone s time The other one sniped me and my buddies from like 2000 meters with the AK on full auto not much to be said there I haven t been victim of one of these false stream sniping scenarios but I do want to add that it s some real LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t I mean the odds of even being in the same server as a streamer that you are aware of is next to like nothing With the current matchmaking setup stream sniping is practically impossible So why the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you banning ppl for that dudes  Not to mention the game breaking bugs Or the in CREDIBLY toxic community Like there s so much to hate about the game it s hard to even get into it So why do I play it  I honestly don t know I m anxious and I guess it s how I get away from doing work for good periods of time since there s so little action it s a good systematic alone time cultivatior But hey if that s the only reason I m playing this broken scrap pile of a game it ain t worth it The only thing I enjoy about this game is playing it with friends  that way you can sort of gloss through your problems and if you go down you go down as a team Otherwise it s just really hard to get behind So as long as these problems aren t resolved I can t recommend this game Maybe once it s been further cemented as a functional less buggy game and the devscommunity management team get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together it ll be worth 30 but I m sorry Not right now,negative
This is still a beta version tbh But the whole concept in general is also faulty1 They are trying to be  realistic  but you can kill your opponent with your fists sooner than with any other melee weapon Still a lot of work to be done in the melee fighting because when a game is so adverstised as being realistic and in many other aspects it is its really sad to witness such poor melee fights Another example  If you hit someone IRL with a machete in close combat anywhere in the body he would be disabled and slowed even fall down unconscious Here you just continue to jump around and throw punches or even shoot and not miss Anyway Enough Melee is bad Needs still work2 a Mind you I don t need more time to review a game as I m playing bout 20 years now FPS etc genre It will be a hit but it will be short lived if they don t make drastic changes The relatively  realistic  aiming and shooting is also not top level Battlefield Bad company 2 which is an old game has better feel to the weapon system etc  Surely PUGBs is the best of this survival mode genre game but  but It surely doesn t say that it is in par with other fpsadventure etc games b the epicly faulty and laggy game shows the other person with his back facing towards you and still registers damage on you from his shots In general the  killing  part of the game close combat is a joke No one can tell how laggy and buggy the registered shots are from a distance3 Vehicles  You die if you try to leap out of an almost stopped vehicle but nothing happens to you if you land on your head while on a motorcycle 4 You can t keep a player pool interested without progression There is no point So till that happens I wouldn t bother paying anything for this game 5 Most annyoing bug  Irresponsiveness of mouse randomly in game Can t fix it you need to forfeit exit game and rejoin anotherMust admit though  Graphics are amazing Except the ones when you are in first person and wielding your gun that needs a lot of improvement on many guns not all,negative
Overall great game but I think bluehole needs to spend time optimizing the game before releasing new content to fix lag and connection issues Even though I have a R5 1600 and a 980ti I can just get 60 fps on high settings with random frequent lag spikesOther than that the game play is really fun and keeps you hooked for hoursI would give the game a 610,positive

This game is great however the servers SUCK and cant handle te player base several times i have got into the last two teams in squads and the game as then crashed i have also recive the error too many playersi would recomend this game for the gameplay the competative element is so good and the tactical movement is a so good every game is different due to loot tables where you drop it the only thing that lets this game down is the servers,positive
Best battleroyal game out there The game is a bit buggy and requires a good PC to play But is still very fun and competitive I haven t come across any cheaters in the amount of time I ve played the game Game is easy to learn especially if you ve come from a game like CSGO or another other shooter The game is best to be played with friends but solo is also just as fun Game is very intense  in the finial 10 your heart will start beating is if you ve just Jun a mileOver all great game just make sure you have the specs to run it I have an Rx 480 8gb and I can run the game fine at 1080,positive

Don t play alone because it sucks play with friends If you don t have an get a life and get some Overall the game is fun with a lot of updates and new content coming out each updates,positive
So baddly optimized ffs it s been so many months and it seems like it s gotten worst Previously ranked top 15 on the OCE server for some background on my credibility but i ve quit this mess of a game around when the Groza came out from the random 20 40fps drops to the horrendous hit registration and poor server perfomence this game is not worth the money in it s current state,negative

I  love this gameI get tons of fun but literally unplayable if you have a HDD for storage  It takes you 1 Minute to load  the mapBefore buying this game buy a Solid State DriveI have also encountered blatant hacking on here 4 timesAll using speedhacks and aim hacks One guys sprayed down my whole squad with all headshots knocking us down instantly we weren t even grouped close together another time I was killed by a guy shooting a pistol while running at a speed faster than someone who is running with boostPlease ban the cheaters or at least introduce a ranking match making system so there s less chance of encountering oneAlso the nerds over in the Asian  servers will teamkill you if you have better loot than them    update Jan 04 2018   I think the updates are on the right trackthe game is no longer as buggy as before 10 and now I can game smoothly on my GTX 960There are still a few bugs like smoke disappearingand a few server side issues like rubber banding and freezing your game without telling you that you have a bad connectionThe recent update changed my mind do get this game it s tons of fun,positive

Opened it the other day to see the new achievement system I hadn t played in a while and was wondering if they had finally fixed it Of course they didn t First game I got into black screen loading death didnt disappear so I was forced to close it Second game no lag perfectly running smooth and then randomly crashes after I get 3 good kills This game deserves death by Fortnite I m so sick of devs doing nothing to improve this garbage instead they add micro transactions and events also you cant say  urg your pcs just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   because its above the recommended settings,negative

TO KICK OFF                   If you think this is your next shooter game  Better stay away PUBG is more about surviving And shooting it s just one of the aspect helping you to survive Even the best gears can t save you of taking sniper shot from unknown direction from far away ending your match in a suddenLooting and roaming the map takes huge part of your play time in the game Gameplay shooting is not bad I like having mixture of TPS and FPS Also the TPP third person perspective and ADS aim down sights combinations attracted me as wellBut there are still room for improvements Regarding developers many improvements will be delivered for final game releaseI ve got the game only because of the great amount of viewers on Twitch But lately I have realized that this game is not for me Is not what I ve been looking for For streamers this game is great as there is a time where you can spend time to response to chat and there is a time where you should be more focused in gameIN MORE DETAILS                           If think you are about to enjoy of the game by after having watched some the other s gameplay Consider this  Most of the time you are just about to loot the first place you ve drop Then run away towards middle of the circle Where you are about to prone waiting for the final circle At this moment you are about remain proneThe other way is to just drop where is the most popular by players dropping and trying to kill as much as possible of themKeep in mind luck have a lot to do with your final perfomance And is involved in your satisfaction of the game Like if you think you can go for long kill streak It doesn t work that way Some times you can find good gears Some times you can t find any gears that suits you best Not just for the first drop even till match end for youOne of the aspect I don t like of PUBG is about having only one chance And also you are not able to revenge Only if you play in a group and you ve got killed Your friends can revenge youContinue in this sense the game feels better if you play regularly with friends than going solo However if you playing all games solo you are going to like it  in case everything above it s fine for you because you are free of not following someone s path or stick to same gameplay every timeVISUAL           Game is developed on Unreal 4 Enging Means visually should be a masterpiece Unfortunatelly for me the game does not look like one Even there are some gross textures Developers barely have put some sort of effort to make the game have stunning look At least the characters looks fineSpeaking about characters There are good amount of customizations I guess they will keep this trend WEAPONS               About weapon customizations There are just a ready presets attachments so far in early access of the game Not all attachments are available to all weapons There are weapons without having option to attach scopeIn my opinion in order to start feel the game you need to have at least 50 h of gameplay Like having played with each weapon common at least once Or drop at almost every popular locationGAMEPLAY                Driving key of continue playing is the feeling you can make it better next time But me personaly once I ve tooked my chicken dinner I stop worry about this and every next match became the same as previous one If you still reading and thinking of getting the game Keep in mind the gameplay skills does not have a huge path but does requires a huge patience You need to learn stuff like taking positions how to move at certain time of the match Shooting skills with most common and preffered weapons Distance recoil and bullet deviation are stuff you have to learn Recognizing player s characters in distance and in foliege in your vicinityIn overall do I recommend this game No if you looking for action Yes if you looking for more slow pace gameplay and huge tension Like litterary at the final circle the game is a lot tenseI hope this review gave a bit of a sense of the gameYou can also check out one of my gameplay videohttps wwwyoutubecomwatch vkzHXYXVe Uk listPLz2m8MzUFJZ4MvZghVcz_KQpYI QeFoLG,negative

After playing this game for 1400 hrs between my two accounts and earned a fair amount stocking skrits I would say for me this is a good game But before you get this game here s a check list for you to complete before buying the game Is this game listed below 20 dollars I got mine for 15 in April and have seen a few price drops since Are you DMG in CSGO Do you have a 9701060 or better Nvidia GPU Do you have 16G ram Do you have a 144Hz165Hz monitor Have you played H1Z1ARMA3 before and wouldn t tilt if you encounter cheaters 5 games in a roll Do you have steam friends with decent mic that will play DuoSquad with you using Discord If all the answer is yes then I have confidence that you will very much enjoy this epic game There s a play style for everyone Now whenever I hear gunshots I run towards them the best way to get lootkill fast and win the game IMO Don t hide like a chicken and die with no kill you won t enjoy the game,positive
Compared to Fortnite and H1Z1 this battle royale is the best one out there Can lag at times but besides that never really had any problems or ever got banned from streamers The first person only is all I play,positive

This game is not optimized It is very hard to game,negative
I tried I tried very hard to like this game There are many good points for example when you can play the game with friends it is quite fun However when the first thing on the game the UI doesn t load properly you get annoyed So you refresh and it works ok then you join a game and you get booted from the server again annoyed Then you get into a game but it is so laggy that you can t find anything annoyed Then you finally find a good server in a good game mode and have a few friends only to be team killed because some little LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  wants to be the only person in a team game instead of going solo ANNOYED There are many points that I can see this game may one day reach but for now considering the amount of money they have squeezed from people you would think they could do betterI will check back with this game in a year but for now it is not worth my time,negative
buggy LOVE LOVE LOVE  game would buy again,positive

This game is total LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing garbage and makes me sick to my stomach when I think about how it cost more than 5It s optimized worse than Batman Arkham KnightIf you want to play a game like this but actully have some enjoyment go install Epic games Fortnite Battle Royal it s free and actully made by people who know how to optimize a game before charging people to play itAlso it s only popular because tones of free copy s were given to twitch streamers and Youtubers who spammed content because this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game type is flavour of the week at the moment15 minutes after posting this I had a someone inbox me asking if I would share the game with him because I didn t like it this information isn t a criticism I just want to point out a number of the community seem to be young impressionable children I assume it was a child anyway considering he can t afford the 30 purchase for a game he clearly wants,negative

This game has become a flaming pile of garbage The dev s are completely unresponsive to the actual needs of this community and game Hackers and teamkillers and high ping exploiters are in every game There s no effort being made to fix game breaking bugs or the UI The devs have obviously given up on this game and I regret ever purchasing this If you haven t yet bought this game   don t You re setting yourself up to be disappointed and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off,negative

With over 700 hours into this game i have come to realize alot of things Bluehole Yeah im talking to you EVERY UPDATE breaks the game even worse than it already is From the bad rubber banding to the glitches it is seriously broken Another thing Ive played approximately 12 games today in which i have encountered 12 hackers Yes they added a  report  section but they do not ban people Then when they do they just ban the name and not the IP so people just buy it again and hack for a few months and its literally a never ending cycle Im seriously considering not even playing this game anymore 700 hours wasted Bluehole Fix your stuff,negative
Boring Slow Paced Campfest people say its fun because they suck at H1Z1,negative
Difficult Difficulty is not a negative though First few games will be rough but the payoff is amazing Graphics are 1010 and the gunplay is fun,positive
I absolutely love this game It has its bugs but IMO that is to be expected and the devs are doing what they can to fix them I personally don t k ow what everyone is complaining about by saying don t kill streamers or you will be banned I haven t had any issues with being wrong fully banned and have played off and on since shortly after launch day Keep up the good job guys Continue to listen to your veteran player base and some newcomers ov casionally have great ideas Your player base is the life of the game,positive
This game is fun but it gets boring after like a day of playing the reason why is because of how broken it is even for a early access game Too many times i have died because of the game crashing for no reason and it gets really annoying really fast credits aren t rewarded game kills you automatically after you reset the game so it can work and dying because the game makes you a floating target for every one to see,negative

This game is fun ok Like any other battle royal game there is This game has came out since March the performance level for this game still is literally disgusting Fortnite has a better optimization than this game for christ sake People overhype this game way to much just cause you see big streamers playing this 247 Play fortnite for a while then come back to this and you can tell right away this game is a disaster For me i prefer this game over fortnite But even so bluehole is doing a horrible job on what they re doing with there own game and bogus updates and still not fixing performance issues,negative
Eh its ok,positive
I used to love this game When it was something new and fresh this was probably one of the greatest multiplayer experiences out there But that spark is long gone A year has gone by and the game still looks like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  crashes often and has added very few things significant things  1 mapBut hey there s lootboxes so YAYBluehole drove their own game into the ground and it shows A once fun new experience is now a boring repetitive grind that I force myself to play just because some of my friends still like the game,negative
Why fix the game when you can add more loot crates If you like riding the hype train and have an IQ under 70 this will be your favorite game,negative
servers are too busy please try again,negative
It was a fun game when it came out and was new because I understood it was new and there would be bugs But only thing that has changed is the size of the dev s pockets still a broken LOVE LOVE LOVE  game that works sometimes and is STILL completely full of cheaters But you only get cheaters when the servers work and let you connect to a lobby If you have 30 bucks to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  away on a broken game I guess buy this one,negative
This game is great lmao,positive
Best FPS game I ever played Simply addictive,positive
Can t climb ladders  1010,positive
This is my 1st review of a game Have 200 hrs and have to say i enjoy this game a lot As of recently there has been a hacking epidemic in the game Roughly 1in3 games will have a hacker Its easy to tell when someone is hacking because they will kill atleast half of the lobby with only headshots with full auto weapons from 600meters away I cant recommend this game to anyone right now because of this issue It s very sad to see a good game get ruined by the consumers,negative
HonestlyI mean HONESTLY how fun is this game Not veryIt gets incredibly stale extremely quick You spawn in run around maybe kill off one or two people and die Sometimes you get lucky and kill off more than 2 and then maybe you ll make it to the end and get a nice  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  message Then you go back to the lobby and do it again on the same mapYes the combat gets intense but after playing for a decent amount of time I can say that it s really boring to do the same stupid nonsense every game I haven t had the pleasure of being banned for stream sniping but as a general player who just played it for a little while I can tell you it s sort of embarrassing to say this is the top Grossing game on Steam They pulled in SO much revenue and only update the game every 2 ish months with significant contentThe devs are crybaby whiny money grabbing stiffs who treat their player base like garbage and ban people because someone sneezed the wrong wayMicrotransactions have no business being in this game because it s early access They should have used the millions of dollars in revenue to bring on some new devs who actually know what they re doing and release more stable consistent updates improve server performance AND take the game out of early access I had fun with some friends the first few games I played but beyond that it s nothing special You honestly would probably get more enjoyment out of watching someone play it on Twitch than playing it yourselfAll in all  You re paying for a battle royale 100 players with no real context other than  kill everyone else  and when you win you get nothing but 50  in game credits toward a loot crate that you can just buy with real money for some reasonThis game isn t impressive and yes it s cool to play what people are playing but do yourself a favor and download Epic s Fortnite BR mode It s free updated every 2 days or so and you can actually build your own shelter Way better Tired of this game getting tons of sales and being updated so rarely It s pathetic,negative

very good developed game it may look like alot of bugs gameplay issues server issues and alot more but its justified because like it says  Early Access  which means that the game is not complete yet but its getting worked on like for example a prototype a prototype is a test product the game has alot of potencial and the devs are working alot to fix the game and making it better by putting constant updates constant fixes and dedicating alot of time one of the downsides is that you need very good specs to run it which limits the majority of usersand all those peopleusers who are posting those bad reviews are either they dont know what Early Access means or they want the game down those who say they are getting banned innocently is a lie and i almost fell for that lie and i can assure you that because none of my friends or my acc has not been accusedbanned for it thanks for taking your time on reading this and i hope you have a wonderful daynight,positive

I don t write reviews often or at all but my experience with this game is something I wish to share As a game Player Unknown s Battlegrounds is the very epitome of  great potential  It has a fun and immersive combat system with amazing sound design and visual quality The map can look incredible if you have the right specs and even without a super computer it can look very nice It does have its issues with running smoothly both client side and server side but most of the time the experience is smooth I would say with a little more time and content this would be a game worth its 30 price tagIn it s current state however it isn t From what I can see it s current state is going to be it s only state for a long long time While the devs are trying to constantly update and optimize the game I haven t seen a significant change in a period of around 6 months Extra guns get added in but the bugs and glitches that broke up my otherwise fun games remained The shootouts went from being fun to being incredibly annoying with people s guns being either incredibly loud or releasing no sound at all and random frame freezes making sniping a bigger risk than advantage I find myself playing for hours at a time to get around 3 minutes of heartpounding action before getting taken out by someone who just happened to be nearby when I started shooting someone else Seemingly random drop speeds make it impossible to predict who will get to a house first One moment I m cleary falling faster the next the guy zooms past me as I automatically pull my chute As a 10 game I would be fine with it but for 30 I m sitting wondering what made this game as good as Cuphead I may have 150 hours but I have only been truly playing and enjoying the game for about 15 All of which are on the same map with the same weapons and the same format except the extremly rare weather changesThe fact that there is no custom testing map makes me nervous It implies the devs don t want the players to actually test their game They just want you to raise their daily player count to drag in more people Most people are just guessing at what the weapons stats really mean and what shot distance does etc Furthermore it has become increasingly obvious that the devs don t stick to their word From pushed back release dates at least somewhat understandable to completely BS purchasable loot crates their word becomes less and less trustworthy A game with the player count of PUBG should not have trouble funding ANYTHING let alone a tournament Streamers make the game seem more fun that it really is with smooth gameplay and clean kills you almost think your looking at a good game But the second you get in you realize that without a supercomputer the glitches become to much and the gameplay becomes a nightmare of repetitionIn the end PUBG just feels like a borderline scam I feel robbed of my time playing both with friends and alone As a game it s something I could see being fun in the future but not anytime soon with it s current developement process It s like a gilded turd a piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lightly coated in gold paint I won t say anything like  I ll change my review when the game gets better in the future  because I don t believe it will I will say however that if you want a 30 cheap thrill this game will give you that but I think it might be better just to watch IT in theatres and play Fortnite after It gives you roughly the same feeling and half the cost,negative

Game is broken  Dev s need to stop adding skin s and other microtransaction bs and focusWe don t want weapon skin s we want better server connectivity and stablilizationIdea is great and dev s have shown commitment but they need to show loyalty to us   the fans rather than working on new games and mobile platform s fix the current versions that they have releasedalso give us a map selection not all of us want to play the pathetic excuse you call a desert map,negative

Game is amazing graphics and all are good but the biggest improvement i would like to see is in the game optimization  It doesn t make sense that higher fps player get more kills and  wins than an poor fps pc its not competetitive i think the game developers want us to shell out more money to the high rigged PC and GPU to play better I may sound like poor PC guy whining about game but most of the player dont own best GPU and processor thats why developer need to work on optimize this game One last thing is the Hackers I  hate them please BAN them immediately and please let us know of they get banned or not because that would be sweet if you guys lets us knowOverall game is aweseome buy it,positive
This is an unfinished game Very overhyped,negative

Make this game available for low end PC,positive
Amazing game design very fun and exciting If you die you can hop right back in starting fresh each time Only problem with the game is the lag issue that gives laggy players the advantage US servers are flooded with players from other countries mainly because they can get kills easier and US players are tempted to play in servers located in other countries for the same reason If they would fix the lag issues I would have to say that this is probably the best fps in the world because of the game design and the awesome sound Since I gave other games a positive review in the past I ll have to say this is a positive review too and its not like other games arent having the same problems,positive
Honestly tried it Honestly didn t like it This is the simplest form in which you can get  Battle Royale  and clearly it s not the best one Very limited on almost all aspects  technical gameplay community,negative
After having put down over 200 hours into this game I can with certainty say that there are better games out there for the same price as this game If you are looking to pick it up spare yourself the frustration and misery that will ensue after only a few hours of playing And if by some miracle you enjoy the game for the first couple of hours as I did it won t last forever as the game still is pretty poorly optimized however there have been significant improvents since early access I am talking about around 70 100 fps with an i7 7700k GTX 1070 and 16 GB of RAM and running this game at almost everything at low and some settings a bit higher with a resolution at 1080p and it still performs like a s sAnyhow if you still are not convinced as to why not buy this game just don t stay as far away from this game as possible because you will only get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off at how bad it is when you die from landing with your parachute or just die instantly 5 6 times in a row,negative

got banned for killing a streamer dont buy this game you get banned so easy you are not allowed to kill streamers and how are you supposed to know that  you dont so you just have to pray that its not a streamer or not kill at all,negative
OverHyped Garbage after the millions they ve maid on this game you d think they would polish it a bit better but nope Loot crates for some BS gamecom Supposed to have realease all content by now but extremely behind because they suck at management  The game itself was fun for a while but after multitudes of glitches and shotty optimization it leaves one feeling empty Also Hackers Galore but since there is no way to really tell because it could just be a crappy glitch you report everyone no matter what,negative
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing broken game a lot of bugs and all the chinese people in NA AS and EU servers LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game its so broken,negative
This review won t change your opinion on buying the game but i still wanna say my critisism The game is improving but still problamatic it runs smoother since the release but it still doesn t run smooth on my not weak computer Crashing also occurs from times to times around once a 2 hour playing seassion  The game is buggy not Bethesda release buggy but far from smooth It also feels kind of cheap from bad sound design to wanky animation the game shows the fact that it was done by a very small group of people But How s the gameplay  It s fine Although I have a lot of hours on the game it s less of a game for me and more of a platform for friends to talk over it doesnt need a lot of atention to have the peak expirience My biggest complain on the gameplay is the very fast area reduction speed it s probably only me but I ll like it much more if the game would take it s time and let players kill eachother slowly Overall the game lacks a lot of polish but is an enjoyable casual game,negative

This game is confusing as to how it functions most of the time Some days I get in lobbies with nothing but the fog map  Tonight right after landing I landed 14 shots with my pistol and the other player lived after I was shot from behind 1 time  Next game I landed at least 8 shots with a SCAR from less than 50 meters and I get shot twice and I die  This game is incredibly frustrating and at the same time it s incredibly confusing because it doesn t seem like it s getting better I keep hearing about how much money it s made and all but where is that money going  The crates are trash because I ve gotten multiples of the same item multiple times  I wouldn t play this game as much if I didn t pay 30  Don t get me started on the lag and the extremely frustrating times when during a game you will not find a gun,negative
garbageshoot a guy 5 times dont die he shoots you once you diethe movement mecanics are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the guns dmg are unbalanced and winning a game is impossible to many things that can go wrong its all about luck you can play 20 games youll die 5 time from the dumb LOVE LOVE LOVE  zone 10 times from a random shoot accross a field or from a random camper that was lucky enough to get a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing scope and 5 time where youll actually get into a fightso many useless shotgun  what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hand guns are useful for   Why does it take so freaking long to land on the ground   WHY TH F would you put vehicul thru the map that you CANT use    LAGGY assfuk,negative

they are to worried about how many people are watching streamers play this game rather then fix the game breaking bugs Also they release new content while not fixing basic issues,negative
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a fun competitive game where you play against other players in groups of 1 2 or 4  You can also play in groups of 3 but there is only a mode for 1 2 and 4 so most other teams would be a group of 4 while you only have 3Firstly one huge issue is one I like to call the  Google Earth glitch  It s when none of the houses of anything loads in and it looks like something out of google earth They eventually load in after probably 1 minute and 4 at maximum but it s just a huge issue that I find almost every game  This issue shouldn t effect people with 16GB of ram or more I dont t know why it happens but it s certainly not very helpful when you are trying to play this game and until they fix they issue I recommend just playing on lower graphics With lower graphics you have more of an advantage in the game anyway you can pretty much see past bushes and stuff is just generally easier to see Secondly the basis is that 100 people are in a plane and they are all dropped along an island with parachutes and they have to use what they find on the ground to fight to the death There are guns melee weapons cars and much moreIn all I think if you are looking for a fun competitive game to play with friends I think this would be a perfect choiceOr Overwatch That s a really fun competitive game to play with friends,positive

Has potential to be a fun game but with problems popping up every 5 or so rounds   buildings not loading in properly massive lag and FPS drops ect  I couldn t recommend this game to anybody If you re looking into getting PUBG and want to play it safe wait until they fix these basic problems in the game before even thinking about itThere is also the big elephant in the room about the developers and publishers of this game Twitch streamers are obviously favorited towards and people have been getting banned for  stream sniping  even if there is no evidence of such Also the whole problem with offering Chinese players an  offical  VPN that costs about the same than the base game for 4 months is beyond ridiculous If you don t want to support scummy devs and publishers stay away,negative
Don t get me wrong I did enjoy the time I had but that was purely because of my mates the game itself leaves much to be desiredWhen I first got it the problems just weren t really noticeable but it steadily became more apparent over time Let me list these problems for you  The banning system is absolutely useless the amount of hackers I come across is incomprehensible  The hitreg is just atrocious I have hit someone several times on my screen for seemingly zero damage and the amount of times I ve peeked and then returned to cover and a full second after I ve gone behind cover I get hit It just makes absolutely zero sense  The optimisation holy moly is this bad I previously had an RX480 installed and could only get 20 30 FPS so I upgraded to a 1080Ti and now I get 40 60 like how is that even possible I ve got more intensive games than this and they run massively betterIf these problems are fixed I will definitely come back to this game and enjoy it again but as it stands it just isn t playable It has become this game that I play with my friends for short periods of time before I have to quit because of these issues How this game became so popular with these problems is just beyond me,negative
I m sure many of you have heard of the  Streamsniping  reviews  I thought I should point out that many of them haven t even experienced that most of them only going off of what other people are saying  IF most of those Streamsnipers can actually provide decent evidence that they are falsely accused then you should probably pay attention  Otherwise it s probably just random people getting salty about getting temp banned  NOW onto the main reviewThis is my first battle royale game and while I have watched quite a few streams and videos I wasn t entirely sure I would enjoy it especially with the reviews  My skepticism quickly disappeared  This is a very fun although somewhat rage inducing piece of work  Is it laggy   Occasionally but for the most part it runs decently on my rig  i7 6700 16gb RAM GTX 1060 SSD and it isn t even top of the line  If you experience performance issues with something similar or better then I don t really know what to say to youI have noticed MAYBE one or two bugs in my time of playing but I wouldn t be the best person to ask about that as I don t play as much of this game as some doI have not seen any hackers yet but as I previously said I haven t played a ton of the game so I wouldn t know too wellVoice chat can occasionally be cancerous in the lobby so I would recommend turning your volume down when you first get into a match and to keep it low until you get out of the plane because earrape while not in every match happen often enough to take precautions againstYes the developers DID break their promise of no microtransactions before getting out of EA and I don t approve of devs breaking promises like what happened with No Man s Sky but at least this game isn t missing a feature promised way before releaseOverall I would say it s a great game  Haven t seen many issues so this review will likely change later on but you should be fine so long as you don t have a 5 year old potato that can t run minesweeper and you don t try breaking the rules,positive
TL DR   Slowly but surely getting betterThis game has been a lot of fun for me  more good moments than bad The recent changes introduced in the test server build of the game has slightly boosted my confidence with how the game is developing There are still problems with the game  namely concerns about cheaters running amok that need to be addressed in order for the game to really get better so until then Im reluctant to really recommend this game,negative
If you love being shot in the back forced to make suicidal mistakes by a moving border and want to run on lowest settings scraping 60 fps buy this game  Can be fun play with friends and it ll be much more fun although don t be competative  This game rewards skill very poorly but that is a nature of the game that cannot be extinguished,negative

After tens of millions of copies sold a metric butt ton of free publicity from streamers and nine months of what I guess you could consider  further development  I m sad to say that I cannot recommend PUBG  at least clearly not in its current state Cheaters poor netcode Bluehole s set of  rules  sluggish development and more performance problems and glitches than I can possibly count are what led me to create this reviewIf you d like to experience battle royale then I highly recommend Epic s Fortnite which runs excellent plays great and best of all is completely free,negative
I am not gonna recommend this game poor server so many cheaters and hackers although FPS games always can not aviod these problems  seems the Bluehole be worst onehow many you can benfit from the players how much bad review you need to bear,negative
PainfullyUnplayableBuggedGamePUBGThe concept of this game is great yet it lacks the technical optimization to be at least competitive Hit registration delays when picking up items and weapons and the incredible amount of lag you get when playing this game along with the low framerates you get  even on high end systems make this a technically inacceptable piece of garbageThis game can be fun if you ignore the technical problems that still existUpdate 03252018 The game is now in a much more playable state than it was when I initially wrote this review but it is still insufficient to change make me recommend it,negative

Great game Youll make it all the way to top 10 on solo just to be shot in the back of the head by a Kar 98 Youll spend countless hours dropping into an area in hopes of finding something good so you can get the drop of your nearest enemy only to find out that even if you run through a 3 story building the best thing youll find is all level one gear and a shotgun Youll spend countless hours questioning the vehicle mechanics youll wonder why landing on the back tire of a motorcycle makes it spin out of control after landing youll wonder why it throws you 10 feet into the air and kills you instantly Youll spend hours and hours perfecting the roof top landings just kidding you wont Because even if looks like youre landing on the roof youre not Youll get stuck in mid air for a few seconds and fall to the ground losing half of your health 1010 would rage again,positive
BlueAnus has created a good game i very much enjoy playing with the boys But as i have been playing more and more i hae started to get bored with the amount of times i spawn and die instantly you may say just get good but i have won many games and im not a horrible player i highly enjoy this game but i dont like the fact that it is very fustrating with bans and streamers at the mommentBuy this game but be cautious if your not one for first person shooter Hunger Game style games then dont pretty simple,positive
Devs make millions apon millions of money and they refuse to release new content on a at least decent rate the map is as boring as watching the PGA golf tour The weapons in this game have the kick of a smith and wesson 500 magnum that had intercourse with a boeing 767 mega jet speaking about planes the design and sounds in this game make my eyes and ears bleed speratically the blue line in this game is more effective then Trumps immigration policy hit detection might as well not exist because who needs that right  UPDATE THE GAME AND ADD NEW MAPS Thank you,negative

These developers need to learn from larger games like CSGO on how to match make and not allow people to just choose which  region  they want to play on  NA servers are now overrun with Asian players and it s just getting way out of control  Please learn how to control your game and your servers so that regions are acutally playing with their own regions and not able to just jump around and create additional lagadvantages from that lag against other players Avoid giving anymore money until they fix these issues if you can  Update above  This game is highly overrated Many issues to list including the issue with the femalemale hitboxes  Apparently they aren t the same  I understand in a real world they aren t however this is a game so it should be equal on both sexes so that you don t have these tools playing female characters to get an extra edge   I honestly can t believe how many people abuse this and nothing has been done to fix it  Other issues include their intro ui still having the refresh button as it glitches all the time and having to refresh your friends list to see that their in game  seems refresh buttons are their go to instead of actually doing more complex coding and doubt if they plan on fixing  Other is the FPS I have a newly put together computer with 8 cores and a decent graphics card yet it will dip at times in this game for no apparent reason  Lastly the servers have lag spikes all the time and connection issues multiple times crashing while joining and just all out poor connections  Oh and dont forget the hackers  Overall save yourself from cancer and avoid this game,negative

It s brilliant how they broke up this gameOne month ago that game was far better than now With a 3 game I was kicked out and I wasn t able to re join without any reason It was like  hey we see you have too many ammo and high quality eq so we disconnect you and don t let you reconnect because NO A few patches earlier PUBG was better game which was better optimized and had less bugs,negative

This game is great at giving the tense feeling when your about to do battle That being said the multiple cheaters hackers ruin it at times And also the optimization needs work but I enjoy it for what it is,positive
Post launch edit Finally the game is out of Early Access and is a full launch game Now that it is full launch I give it a thumbs up because they have fixed almost everything thats mentioned in my previous review as you can see down below However there are still some bearable rubberbanding at start of the match few game crashes but overall tolerableBesides the Devs have yet to increase the price for the game despite the full launch so hurry and grab it before they decide to change their mind                                                                                                                                     Would really hope I could recommend this game but I just cannot at this stage I was never a big fan of H1Z1 and never a fan of this genre PUBG delivered the Battle Royale genre perfectly However the main issue I am giving the negative review is due to the developers and the cancerous community Bought it few weeks after it released for early access couldnt even play a decent proper match due to poor optimisation back then Constantly trying to play it after every update and the patches are so poorly delivered and most of the time it made the game worse than before Among the 1863 hrs that was recorded I think 34 goes to game being stuck in loading screen or texture not loading until 8 minutes past the match not connected to server disconnections and many many many more technical issue Apart from that recently there are people experiencing unreasonable ban to their account for  stream sniping I cannot but to not reccommend this game as of this current stage The developers do have the resources to fund their game  considering the amount of people purchased this game for better servers more staff to work on the optimisation of the game but instead they come up with cosmetic items steam market  new content  which usually comes with new bugs gamescom e sports and all sorts of nonsense instead of making the game rightI am running on a decent rig GTX1050 8GB RAM i5 7th gen and I need to run the game on very low to get 45   50 fps when I can run Battlefront or BF1 on High graphics Initially this game was planned to be out of early access within 6 months of early access but obviously the developer got too comfy over the sale of the game and hence the delay and little to no work done to the optimisation of the game If you are not ready to deliver within 6 months period or end of 2017 dont promise it in the first placehttp wwwpcgamercomplayerunknowns battlegrounds pushed back from initial 6 month timeframeApart from that they also promised a weekly and monthly update UNTIL FULL RELEASE which eventually only lasted give or take a good 4 month and then they stoppedThis game is not recommended and should not be reccommended at this current stage until Bluehole fix the game,positive
OK LOOK i absolutely LOVED this game and i put time and effort into it but the fact that every server is  filled to the brim with chinese hackers has RUINED the game you cant go 2 games without seeing being killed by a hacker on pubg region lock china and maybe youll actually bring the game back to life,negative
Live die repeat If you enjoy getting picked up by random stranger in little sedans only to pull the pin on that trusty grenade on your waistband then this game is for you Beware of stranger danger though sometimes your random teammates feel as though they need to repay this kind at by doing the same to you One of the biggest problems I ve had with this game is when I get kid by someone blatantly cheating A kill cam would also be nice I realize squad and duos you could get an unfair advantage if shown tour killers location however if you were given the opportunity to see that replay when the round is over or if your team dies that would be great,positive

Classic battleground games You get the bugs the lack of optimization and the clunky feeling Nonetheless this game is fun if you dont go School Or go school All depends on the RNG,positive
This game isn t worth getting even though it has a HUGE playerbaseThe servers are bad and rather laggy and slow if you can deal with that knock yourself out but I am not gonna waste my time playing until this issue is fixed I can deal with the game not being well optimised since it s an early access but atleast have the servers in check before releasing a game that has 100 per lobby and 1m playing everydayI can t reccommend the game as of now but once their servers are fixed I ll go about and edit this review to reccommending it until then I don t reccommend you spend money on this game just yet wait a bit  ,negative

The game has it s quirks but what  early access  game doesn t  I think the developers are doing a good job at patching what they can and working on new features In my personal experience there are server issues but they are few and far between The frustration can be real if you spend 10 minutes grabbing loot only to die to something really stupid like a barrier in a game without vehiclesMy only real gripe is how streamers are given access to custom servers and are advertised within the game  decals on buildings I feel like it s creating a special class of playersOverall I enjoy the team play and singles play The two really feel like very different games Additionally the addition of first person view to what used to be only third person is very nice They both have their pros and cons but overall they are enjoyable Lastly this is one of the few games I have a blast playing with friends I m not a shooter kind of guy but this game really is enjoyable with the right group of friendsI d recommend the game,positive
I want to say this is buy far more addicting then rust you probably will get intense rage from killing any chinese people cuz there are very very good   the korean s are very skilled playersthe player base is chig chang chong super fun when ur in a team kinda have to use a translator if ur playing alone highly recommend playing with 3 other friends teams of  4 or  2 or solo what ever u like side affects high  of stresshigh chance of addictionshaking  hands sighs of addiction you start to grow man hairhard nipplesboner,positive
THE GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE  RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE COMMENTSand any new commers to the gameGAME DEVLOPMENT PlayerUnknownsBattleGrounds is a game that has over a million sales and has done great but the development is not done The game is in early access and has not finished by far The Devs want to add a lot more features such as bullet penetration single player more maps better animations  and much more There may be its fair share of bugs and such but there is a good reason for not fixing everything as it comes out Games are made with code and every mess up or feature added can change a large part of the game Say they fix every problem with the game now such as penetration with water clunky animations gun rework that would be nice and all but then as they add more content to the game they need them to work with earlier features that s what gets games to progress slower then you have to rework everything again and again to work with new features The easiest thing for the dev s to do is to add everything they can more maps cars guns things on the maps untill the majority of the features are in the game So they can rework everything without having to redo reworks because of more features down the road that need other features to change  Some of you say they have the funding to fix it now that may be true but the game needs people to make it there s not an army of people to make the game and if there is you can t make everything at once Some features need other features to be complete before they can be made There is an order of operations that go into the creation of games Here s an example say they add bullet penetration that s GREAT that means every new gun needs it too so whats the deal  every feature that affects guns has to go into the development of new guns meaning more time on making that gun meaning less time and staff working on bugs meaning that other features need to be delayed meaning a prolonged full release If you add the guns now get them working then add the bullet penetration then you get bullet penetration for all guns Since bullet penetration was made after the guns you don t need to rework bullet penetration with new guns and vise versa which is a living hell with game developmentSEVERS To those that are experiencing problems with servers don t waste your time complaining China may have  ads  but all i here is that there is 1 ad and its for a vpn to help you connect better that seems like the devs caring about getting chinese players better connection Any problems with the servers are expected and they happen all the time and sometimes it can just be your internet or someonelses internet messing with the server servers are a strange topic and have alot of varibles but just because you have a problem with a server dosen t mean its the server it could be youGAME TRANSACTIONS All those that complain about in game micro transactions what are you talking about  you can buy a key to open a crate that was only available for the gamescon invitational the crate was a special and you can not get it anymore other than the steam market i don t see any problem with this it s a 1 time thing to celebrate an event you can complain if you want but you don t have to get those crates when they came out you could still get the normal crates and open them for free if you chose to get the gamescon crates over the normal don t complain because you made that choice if you don t want to spend extra money in the game to open a crate its simple don t get the crates that need money In CSGO ALL crates need you to buy a key to get some content at least with pubg you can open them for free with this exception There may be more like this in the future but know you don t need to spend points on the crates that need money to open Stop blaming the devs for adding in small features that you pay for Also know the game is not going to be bought infinitely its sales will slow and their income for keeping servers up will dwindle so these small in game purchases will keep the gaming going after sales slowThe game in its current state is great it has issues but it s not a full game yet there s much to add It s in early access now but that s the best part i love experiencing the new features first hand and be able to influence the development of the game if you buy this game expecting the game to be polished and bug free and just a 100  pleasant game then you should leave Those of you who love to try games see how they develop and enjoy testing features don t care about it being complete or not then this game would be alright with you The game is a good and the negitivity it gets is just unjust,positive

This game is super lovehate for me Had alot of fun with it but it just too inconsistant now in just about every aspect i dunno even know what happened This game at its core is very random which is fine but when you add that with the bugs and the brutal inconsistancy of the servers lately it has become more of a frustration than a enjoyment Yes i know it s early access and as far as i am concerned i have got my moneys worth but there is only so long i am willing to let them use that as a excuse considering by their original statements it should have been out of early access already I just hope they can reel in these problems game has such huge potential,negative

This is a must have game the price is low but the tension is highNow I am pretty crap at it sloth like reactions so I get wasted alot when I fight however I can frequently get top 10 without firing a shotwhats fun about that  Because this is not COD there is no re spawn you get shot enough once in the head you are outSo I am playing 30 minute games sometimes you get in a house and hear some anon running around well anon you have to come down those stairs and I have a 12 gauge with your name on it heart pounding anon appears an boom goneSo I am hiding behind a rock and I can see the zone shrinking I know where we were dropped off and I recon most players will have to come past me from the South so I move to a rock which overlooks south someone sneaks up behing me and M16s my head why didnt I stay putits every game why did I moveif only I had stayed hiddenwhy didnt I let one of the other 5 kill themNot seen any banning in the OC or Asia servers not saying that those who have been banned are lying I just havnt seen it personallyReplayability   well its random its Multiplayer only there will be new maps coming out it will be a go to game for a few years guaranteedOne point of note unless you have bandwith and GBs to spare you dont need the test server I think you get early acces to new mapscontent but if you are not bothered just cancell its downloadGreat game definately recommend,positive
Got friend banned because he killed a streamer Seriously  Just playing game and boom ban It is not satisfying as it may seem also not well optimised and buggy i have really decent internter speed but i have high ping and it is really annoying when u are trying to open doors I will better stick to unturned or play among the cheaters in cs go Ps still in beta developers pay more atttention to stramers and monetization than general game developing Im lucky that i still can refund it,negative

Its HorribleTha game has huge synch problems First you see the player running into the shack pin the grenade and the next thing you see is him teleporting right next to you It geats especialy outragous when you see the blood hitmarkers signaling your actualy hit but after 25 nothing happens People can literaly stay for the whole game within a house watching the last 2 players fight just to clean up afterwards Even the most important feature the blue zone is more pain then fun The whole game turns into russianroullett and lets you pray that the circle or a camper dont get in your way Sometimes the ring is on the other side of the whole map or you dont have to worry at all which lets you shoot all incoming players who were unlucky forced to runThe weapon attachments makes defending yourself almost impossible simply because you will never see your enemy The map barely has details for run and gun playstyles favoring campers with firemuzzles sniperrifles and the overpowerd silencers even more The shot player gets no information except a gunsound if you are luckySometimes you have fun in this game,negative

Running for the blue zone simulator  with the last update The trajectory of this game reminds me quite a lot about what happened with  The Culling  I would not recommend buying this game when there are several Free to play options around Regarding the development   They are too focused on making money with crates  They are too slow fixing bugs   Not a lot being done against cheaters  Not possible to choose map,negative

There are many many issues with this game and I will go down the listPro s   First game to apply this kind of twist to a Battle Royale that is not a mod of H1Z1  You can sometimes  Depending on the servers mood at the time play with friendsCon s   The developers have decided that if you kill a streamer you are 100  stream sniping and will ban you Let streamers handle this themselves like they have had to do for EVERY OTHER GAME  The developers have decided to go out on a witch hunt against fornit for copying there game I swear gradeschool all over again  This game has undoubtedly grossed over 300 MILLION at this point yet there team is not big enough to put out more than 3 5 bug fixes a week This game is one of the buggest I have played since the beginning of garry s mod And we are still forced to jump over fences 300 MILLION and you can t add a vault feature or at least make it so you don t clip into wallsfences   This game is terribly un optimized They can say it is early access all they want but when you have the money to employ enough people to create your own engine there should be no reason why my 1080ti only gets 50 90FPS I bought a 165hz monitor and a 1080ti to have a advantage with refresh rate and smoothness and it struggles to keep this game above 60fps when you have more than 2 3 people around youI do NOT recommend buying this game Wait for a developer that knows what they are doing to publish a worthwhile battle royale Or go play fornite s new battle royale it is much better that this crap Oh and I peg my fps out at 165,negative
This game is great we all know it like come on almost all of steam likes this game now my only gripe at all is only 4 player teams I have so many friends that play and generally there are around 5 7 players who want to play at a time It would be cool if we could all play on one team instead of dividing the friends into multiple teams,positive

This beta released game with the ability to have up to 100 players fighting againist each other has a LOT of potential  From the beggining of game play  a parachute jump from a C 130 takes all players to parts on the map of their choosing  Every landing is unique with building clusters that players hurry through finding items along the way to attack or defend one self with during game play  There are time restraints during all the hunting for weapons   finding enemy so one must pay attention to these time limited sections  Looking foward  to game release with more maps and the opportunity to have a finished game to enjoy,positive

UPDATE  For being a Official Released game you would think by now that when i start up the game im not STUCK looking at the loading screen and FORCED to restart my PC The only reason I even play this game is because of friends otherwise i wouldn t play thisThe WORST game I have ever played Load up the game pick a spot to jump land in said spot loot some houses run into circle then use PUBG winning strat A hide in a bush or B Call Of Duty style and hide in a corner until somebody walks past you Not much to it very dull NO real progression some loot boxes that you earn now requires you to BUY a key to open it,negative

Overall you get what you pay for in terms of entertainment over time Can be fun to play with friends but solos are really only fun if you re patient and decent at the game Thumbs down because after 200 hours in I can firmly say that while the game is worth the money for the time I ve played it is overrated The map being entirely too large and barren results in a 90  loot 10  fight problem  If your response to this matter is to drop into a highly populated area and fight more at the start this is a weak response due to the fact that the game is undoubtedly weighted on the quality of your pc  giving a huge fight advantage to a player with an expensive build  Desync and agonizing network lag are also major problems currently but those are mostly due to the fact that the game is extremely popular and servers are overpopulated Once the game is optimized and maybe better maps come along with more loot saturation I will change my review,negative

Imagine landing Pecado only because you got tired requeuing hoping for Erangel You make due with what you get a pistol from an entire apartment building You get a few insane headshots and find a winchester You hit a quickscope 200meter headshot and find a weapon on their body killing a duo team with that Meanwhile your teammate also had found just a pistol but being the trashman he is died You then start driving off only to be shot at again and decide to juck  uck a camper  and stop You 2 tap that man then get bored and drift around like youre playing dirt rally You now have 8 kills and dont expect anyone else to be in town You hit a ruined car that is in the road and start to pop a pain killer  YOU THEN GET LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SHOT AT FROM THE APARTMENTS FROM THE CITY THAT HAS SEEMED VACANT THE ENTIRE TIME You press F and then realize it has only canceled your painkiller and the man kills you You realize he probably had 2 kills at max and was camping the entire time You are always going to find those people and if you play aggressive you will eventually be punished by someone with more  patience  than you Despite this I do enjoy this game although i always seem frustrated each School or Milly wipe makes it all worth it or even perhaps running into a building and flickshotting on a camper These moments make you feel great and fill you with a sense of accomplishment This is why I have invested so much time into this game for the feeling of accomplishment   And of course to trash talk all of my friends that are worse than me,positive
I used to like this game but the recent updates changed the timing of the blue zones to 50 seconds when the first zone closes Completely ruins the flow of the game If youre fighting there is almost absolutely no time to loot If you ignore fights and choose to loot there still isnt enough time to loot well enough for endgame With this update who would have time to get crates Great game ruined by its jealousy with its rival Trying to be something it isnt  Fortnite,negative

I have very much enjoyed this game for the rather short time i have played it in the 3 or 4 matches i ve played i never experienced major lag my computer runs it at a very smooth 60fps with max graphics so i haven t had issues with the game running badly either I have seen only one cheater and have had no issues with really anything that i hear people complaining about I am glad i bought this game instead of just avoiding it like many reviews saidYes this game is still in early access but it plays better than any early access game i have played previously I can see this game getting kind of old quickly if you just play it one match after another but if you space it out  and have a friend or two to play with This is an great title and i can t wait to see everything that will be added in the future,positive

This game clearly demonstrates the value of public opinion If you think the Marvel Universe is the greatest thing to hit movie making since Charly Chaplin   Robert Downey Jr is the finest actor who ever lived then PUBG is definitely the game for you I mean twenty million people can t be wrong correct   You go get  em tiger and say Hi to WCgr333771icg for me you will know him when he caps you from three quarter s of a mile Have fun   we ll see you in RUST after you have played a few hundred hours and realise running across a map for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  loot and then dying just isn t fun,negative
This is a good game is you have the hardware for it IntegratedOld Graphics just won t cut it and you ll get roughly 40fps at the most on this action packed game With a nice PC you can run it well and it is a very fun game to play for hours at a time,positive
Player unknown has been making this kind of games for other companies this being one of the first games that he has done by itself has been one of the best games i have played i replaced csgo for this but if youre looking by the reviews trying to make a decision for buying it there are going to be some problems  you need good internet and a good computer i doesent matter what kind of pc you have you MUST play this at low or very low for having a  good  expierence The lag that everybody talks about its real doors open a second later after you press f granades are worst another point is cars cars in this game are one of the most important things after guns and where you land but mrunknown made this game SUPER REALISTIC but not with cars SPECIALLY MOTORCYCLES see this 2 wheeled kind of cars in this game are pure trash lets imagine that youre driving and you land normaly in any other game you would just keep going but in little battleground if you land a motorcycle IT FLIPS FOR NO FRICKING REASON and then well cuz gravity u fall down the bike and die this will be one of the biggest problems in this game but cars have SPECIAL POWERS like if you crash and your car flips well thats the end of the story cuz this game needs to be realistic so you cant unflip cars by pure force like in gta BUT LISTEN TO ME IF YOU HAVE A MEDiUM PC AND GOOD INTERNET BUY THIS GAME IT IS WONDERFUL U GET ATACHED TO IT AFTER A FEW KILLS AND WHEN YOU START KNOWING HOW TO PLAY AND THE STRATEGIES YOU WILL HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE sorry for bad english and puntuation and caps cuz really this game is good if you learn how to have fun with it ,positive

Why is everybody so hyped about Battlegrounds  From day 1 I only had problems with it Its the third day I brought this game and only did play around 30 a 40 minuts The servers are very bad and they keep updating First impressions  I REGRET BUYING THIS GAME   ,negative

Great game  Requires a better then average PC for faster loading of texture tho New content if being added on the regular dont like the loodbox pay system,positive
Not too sure why people are hating on this game Sure the devs are banning people a bit too often   not me  but i mean Ive had a lot of fun playing this game Ive never experienced any kind of performance issues   i7 3770 GTX 960  And only crash every once and a while  which I expect from a pre alpha gameAll and all this is by far the best pre alpha game ive played in a while,positive

i like this but the game got stuck,positive
this game is better than H1Z1 and a pretty good execution of the battle royale concept that arma III modders originally popularized  if you like pub but you aren t familiar with arma and it s modding scene you should def check it out   much of the realism and other aspects of pub that people love were originated in the arma series made by bohemia interactive  personally i think the hype surrounding pub has gotten a little carried away  the biggest problem is that it s extraordinarily poorly optimized   i have to run mostly low settings to get 60 fps consistently on a brand new i7700k1080 ti rig with 16gb ram  i ve heard some people with high end rigs say they get decent performance on low or medium settings but many if not most players seem to have performance issues like i do  this wasn t as big of a deal when the developer initially promised to address all the performance and optimization issues before focusing on the monetization of the game via esports or a crate system or advertising or other typical ways that very popular games are milked for cash  unfortunately these promises were broken quite blatantly and while there have been some small fixes or improvements for some issues for the most part performance even on high end systems remains a huge problem  yet somehow the crate system esports and in game advertisements and transactions are all a part of the game already and recently a new company was formed to help monetize the game more effectivelyto make things even worse recently the pub developer bluehole has publicly threatened the developer of fortnite over it s battle royale expansion   when you start threatening people and implying you have ip rights to a concept you got rich with but very clearly did not originate but lifted intact from a modding community sponsored by another developer well let s just say that s not a good look  while people have been slow to anger with the pub developer  i think because they love the very unoriginal concept so much the patience of much of the community regarding the continuing failure to address various performance issues and other fundamental problems with the game while it is being aggressively monetized at the same time seems to finally be running out  hopefully it s not too late for bluehole to rectify some of it s recent missteps  i think if they continue to focus on the monetization of the game while ignoring the communities  pleas to address basic performance issues or threatening people over the use of a concept they did not originate and don t own then they may snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and lose the opportunity for pub to become a major esport and maintain it s current popularity in the long run,positive
PUBG is fantastic when it works the way its supposed to The recent update improved the gameplay to run smoother bringing me back to play it as a result but its still got a long way to go if it wants to put its smoother running younger brother Fortnite asideOverall PUBG is more playable than what it use to be and I commend PUBG Corp and hope they continue to make the game and servers the best they can be until they refuse to listen to the community and tick them off of course  which will happen,positive

 I will update this review if possible  or write a new one when I see changes I really want to recommend this game But at the moment it has some issues  At first when I started playing  before the last patch I had no major issues apart from the expected  Early Access  type stuff you get in games that aren t polished yet  Everything is Early Access these days So expect LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to not always work  Aim through scopes  Horrible  De sync  Overall lag  Horrible  Stuck in plane  Horrible  UI Refreshing Gosh I haven t even used my browser s refresh that much _  Damage on point blank  Horrible  And all the other things many mentioned Water planks cloth and so on  Fall damage is ridiculous  You can jump off rooftops and get no damage most times but dare jump of a bike going 1mph you dead son  Try jumping over a low wall without a run up  HorribleSo yeah loads of horrible crap but whatever its Early Access I m fine with that Those are all things that are manageable The main thing that made me choose  thumbs down  is the fact that since the last patch every single match I have to ctrlaltdel and select sign out so that the OS force closes the game As soon as the match ends and I select  Return to Lobby  the game hangs No alttab  No AltF4  no nothing works The game keeps the focus apart from the ctrlaltdel screen  This means I have to re open everything Oh and since the last patch I also have to explicitly run Steam as Administrator Just for Pubg End of the day this bug is really F  king annoying It extends the time between matches so much that by the time I rejoin the team I don t really feel like playing anymore because death in game sucks so much moreTo the devs  CEO  whatever Stop worrying about Fortnite really it maybe the same genre but its nothing close to Pubg  Fortnite for me is a kiddy version of something nothing like Pubg apart from the main mechanics fornite is a joke its nothing serious Not once have I had any similar feel while playing it over Pubg  Instead you guys should focus on what you have  Fix the bugs that cause major issues instead of chasing after epics fornite who cares  I don t want to bash fornite its something of its own but bleh I don t see why the fuzz The only thing fortnite does better than pubg at the moment is it runs pretty well AnywaysI read that you guys are busy with the server side stuff another reason not to worry about fortnite You guys have millions of connections to handle  facepalm  key word is millions Instead of chasing after them and what they did and how you feel about that Search for devs rather so they can start working on optimizations and the rest of the midhigh layer  Focus on getting the application to run fine without making it literally unplayable  These are things like the main bug I and others have atm It makes it unplayable Not having balance or falling damage thats insane or a scope that doesn t really function  In my book those things aren t making the game unplayable it makes it more interesting Some will disagree again who cares its early accessAnd fix the coloring Geez learn something from Re shade do some tweaks on the post processingOkay some goodnessThis game is definitely a recommendation its great Broken somewhat but greatEvery single match had me in a place where I haven t been for a really long time just the right amount of  Juice  The sound in the game for me is Perfect for what they have it really drives the game  Hearing shots in the distance or someone walking around on the floor above you while you thought you were all alone is just an amazing feeling Heart racing  The other day I had to beat someone to death with my fists  in game ofc because I were to slow to get into the house I came down just after him and entered the same house soon after While he was busy looting I sneaked up on him and killed him even though he had a nice SCAR  D The game is full of awesome moments It makes you want to retry and retry and retry Until  Winner winner Chicken Dinner,negative

Pretty good But can be kind of frustrating since you often get shot out of nowhere and you dont even get to see a replay of whomfrom where you got shot Dont expect it to be call of duty like its mostly mediumlong range combatsniping Collecting gear and weapons can be a bit tedious especially if you get ganked just as you completed the perfect setupBest strategy is probably to seek out combat until you are good enough at it so you can grab the stuff the other players spent time collectingExpect to spend a fair amount of time tweaking graphics settings for good performance,positive

Glitchy game but amazing concept Its too bad the developer is a crook and sells hacks that battle eye cant detect They often ban accounts for no reason just so you have to buy another one They blame battleeye and claim its irreversible I would recommend playing the free game the copied this from Fort niteThey apparently fixed the battle eye problem and the game play is amazing,negative

   Update 12018 after almost 1000 hours in   PROS  Game is more optimized now went from 30 fps to 60 80 fps with AMD 8350fx I need a new processorCONS  An increase of hackers De sync getting killed seconds later after being shot and from a different angle than what initially occured A majority of players in the top 10 leaderboard are all hackers check their stats and yet they are not getting banned There s a slight lag time while dragging and dropping items into inventory which results in thinking you had a piece of armor on or item already in your slots but you didn t and realizing a few minutes later Sometimes can t drop items because inventory is full   like why lol You get fall damage even if you landed properly There is lag on the parachutes especially in populated areas once everyone starts falling down to their designated location Everyone just shows frozen mid air and then quickly drops down it s not my internet or graphicsOverall good game and still in the works Just try to enjoy the process                                                                                                                            I played this game so much it made me forget my other priorities irl or lag on it lolsmh i got to the point where I watched twitch streamers religiously  Grimmmmz Summit1g JoshOG Shroud TimtheTatman Lirik TSM peeps a bunch of good people to learn the game betterPROS Fun game  adrenaline pumps especially when there s only 10 people left or less or intense fightsSquads w friends is the best The battle royal concept is greatAddicting because you can die in 1 minute once you land and it s easy to start a new gameYou ll always say okay 1 more game2 3 hours later okay i m done forreal nowThe longer this game has been out there has been more skilled people so it s definitely challenging especially in solos these daysReally tests your FPS skills you need map awareness have to know when to hold your breath when to use ADS  Red dotholo etc or just hip fire recoil control know when to shoot or not know when to engage or not you ll learn all this later down the line coming from counter strike background helps a lotYou become a decent player once you put the hourswork in CONS You need a decent computer to handle this game I had to upgrade my computer multiple times to even play lolStill a few bugs definitely better than a couple months ago but some will make you rageStill working on optimization  it s okay though still betaStill a few hackers about a month ago or lessmy whole squad got wiped out by an aim botter who was 400m away and was shooting us all at the same time and we saw him speed hack towards us to loot our bodiesCrate boxes suck you get like 4 5x of the same item 999  of the timeIf you solo in a squad or duo and auto match with randomsGOOD LUCK lol You ll either get AFKers people with no mics or won t talk trolls ragers or people from different countries so communication is horriblemaybe 1 of 10 games you get decent teammatesSometimes you can t tell if that person is really good that killed you or just got lucky or bc of a bugYou can get damaged more than half hp gone and your helm and vest won t even be damagedAfter 500 hours in you start to get boredsame map same old  loot shoot diewin repeat,positive

Its looter based so if your coming from KOTK expect different gameplay,positive
I got this game because I see people at my local lan cafe using it and I m one to hop onto a hype train However I can t reccomend this to anyone1 Glitchybuggy and not just in secondary features but core mechanics like hit detection 2 Slow3 Lack of rewardThe core idea of the game is a battle royale with 100 players The obvious problem being only 1 out of the 100 feels any sense of reward the rest of them are left chasing the high so to speak Obviously everyone wants to win so the game is played slowly with long periods of time spent running around the alltogether too large map without seeing anyone at all I dont know why someone would choose a game in this style over a more fast paced polished shooter I can t think of a single thing this game does well enough to recommend buying it More of a wilderness roaming adventure than an fps,negative

Battle Royale games are gonna be a thingBluehole will not be a major contender for AAA titles at this rate This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing garbage   Client side hit reg means that guy from Asia coming into the NA server will win the fight 910 because of lag  Player perspective does not mesh with hitboxes or even trajectory Think you re gonna shoot through that window and hit that guy  Nope despite your perspective being clear you re going to shoot the wooden frame  No bullet penetration Can t hit people in water Can t shoot through flimsy boards of wood You CAN sometimes shoot through railings in stairs but unless you re shooting AT the stairs rather than FROM the stairs you likely will not get anything done  Obnoxiously large map 8x8 is too damn big with the RNG of the circle and vehicle spawns   The servers are garbage Rubberband all over the place hit desync all the good stuff  There s aimbotters and hackers everywhere and Bluehole doesn t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about it   If you kill a streamer there s a good chance you get banned because it s impossible to prove that you re not streamsnipingDo not get this game in EA Wait for full release  to be honest it probably won t get there if you are really keen Or play Fortnite cause at least you don t need to worry about paying for garbage,negative
Got almost 4 hours of  gameplay  but less than an hour of it was spent actually playing the game and enjoying it Takes like 10 20 minutes for me to be able to tell what s an entrance to a building and what even is a building I at one point was walking down a open plain with no obstacles and all of a sudden found myself trapped in a tractor that wasn t visible to me before My friend had to kill me and revive me to get me out of it,negative

READ FIRST If you don t have 16GB of Ram and ATLEAST a GTX1060 don t even bother You won t be able to run the game sufficiently And even with good hardware prepare for massive server lags fps drops and gunfights you are losing because of fps differences or latencyI love this game but I can t recommend it If you don t care playing a laggy and klunky game that doesn t even look that good go for it It has its charme and weapons feel very realistic But if you are looking for a very good polished competitive Battle Royal Game I would rather suggest you try out Fortnite Battle Royal its free,negative

I don t really know whether or not I should or shouldn t recommend this game I ve played it a bunch but for someone who hasn t already purchased it  I don t know if it s worth it to buy in its current stateThe developers of this game seemed to be the hero we needed with all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and abandoned early access games around Steam at first Now I don t really know how to feel about them They re still doing a good job adding new content and patching major bugs and all but then there are bugs like default server being off EVERY time you queue up and more  minor  bugs like that that seem to take a long time to patch even though presumably being a fairly easy fix As well as having one of the shadiest Rules of Conduct shenanigans out there like changing the Rules of Conduct without telling anyone  making ini editing bannable And as we all know they have made stream sniping bannable for some reasonSo yeah I have played 650 hours of this game now and I don t really plan on stopping simply because there is no similar alternative out there right now The lack of competition for PUBG is another thing that really worries me The whole ordeal with PUBG and Epic Games  Fortnite and how Bluehole iswas  considering further action  is ridiculous and shows how Bluehole might be scared of competition There may be and probably are other reasons for that drama but we ll never know what the true motives areIf you really just want a battle royale game that has good gameplay and is  mostly  working buying PUBG isn t a bad idea You ll most likely have plenty of fun for 30 but you ll have to be prepared for  CONNECTION CLOSED  and a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of server issues and lag Optimization is horrible so you ll most likely struggle with FPS as well Even on the lowest settings with a 980Ti and R5 1600 I drop below 60fps ALL the time Keep that in mind as wellIf you want a  finished  battle royale game then stay far FAR away from this for now Either wait for this to be fully released or wait for a big company to make their own polished BR game There are definitely some in the works just because PUBG is so popular IIRC Bluehole said they ll put out the full release version of this game within 2017 or early 2018 I don t quite remember but either way I highly doubt they can make that goal unless their definiton of  finished  is vastly different from mineIn consensus gameplay is great but many aspects lack polish eg leaning over windows and whatnot Vaulting is not yet here as of 07102017 so movement and jumping is pretty bad and probably most importantly servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at the beginning of games and client optimization is WAAY sub par Both have been promised fixes but I won t change my review for something that isn t here yet Gunplay is extremely good and satisfying  when the servers work except for shotguns which aren t very consistentIf you re impatient and you like BR games get this If you don t know if you like BR games I d stay away until the bigger problems are fixed Let s just hope that doesn t take too longEDIT  Changing review to positive now that I ve tested out the 10 patch No doubt it s EASILY something I can recommend when it s actually out on live servers but since the test servers will be on until 10 is live I can safely recommend buying this game now if you ve had your eye on this game,positive

Started playing in the early EA period and it was fun Could get occasional wins post high in the end game Now I m lucky to get out of the first 20 dead since everything feels so random Bullet spray seems random desynch houses with no loot You re basically punished if you don t land in a highly populated area Guns that don t matter instead of hardcore bugfixing This game is no longer fun it s a chore to even play,negative
I ve played a lot of shooters and PUBG has the best multiplayer gunplay out of all of them Shootouts are intense and the netcode is great in my opinion I m amazed each time I kill an enemy that my bullets actually hit what I was aiming at Using a giant blood splatter instead of a hit marker is genius in my opinion It adds that extra bit of satisfaction to the gunplayAnother plus is the teamwork More often than not I end up on a squad of liked minded random individuals that want to work together I ve never played another game that required so much team work BF4 for example you re put in a squad and everyone just runs off on their own In PUBG you stay as a tight squad or you die,positive
This game is amazing I ve always liked the battle royale game mode from Arma III and then from H1Z1 but this game just seems to take it to the next level and it looks like it s only getting better from here I can t wait for this to come out on xbox so I can play it with even more friends,positive
mmmm lovely microtransactions on a 27 game yummy yummy,negative

It s a good game but there is quite a big glitch that you can get banned for but it isn t really the users faultThe glitch is that the building won t render in but you can still go inside of through a wall or a roof and you just get stuck inside the building floating or skating around in the building Overall a good game,positive

Don t really care for 3rd person play in this game but FPP mode is addicting Since PUBG is still in pre release stages they strugle to stabalize and optimze the platforms player experience PUBG shows potential if they can begin to execute their plan towards a general release of the game I think Bluehole Studios needs to refocus efforts on refining their product before releasing to console because if it can t run flawless on a GTX1080 imagine what a disppointment XboxPS4 will be,positive
Great game to play alone or with friends,positive

I bought this game awhile ago got 150 hours on it in 2 weeks I ll check back in another 150 hours to confirm if good or not  ,positive
The game is addictingly fun but issues need to be worked on firstHit registry is pretty bad  you still have to shoot someone twice with a shotgun from 10 feet awayYou cannot hear the vehicles coming at you until it is almost too late to dodge themSquad play ALWAYS places me with people who dont speak english and they always stay outside the blue zone and suicide I don t understand itYou should not be told when you knock out a player you should only get visual ques because too often players know they knock you out and just run up to you wherever you were and kill youWhen in a squad and you get killed you can still talk to your team and tell them where the enemy is This is a blatant cheat and it is unfair Apon death players team chat should be shut off right awayWhen dropping from parachute there is nobody around absolutely nobody falling to the ground or falling with me and within ten seconds of landing and going in the building someone fully kitted blows me away There has to be a glitch that doesnt show some players fall from the skyThere are hackers in the game a guy with a handgun blew out all three of my fully kitted team somehow from jumping around us shooting and someone headshot me with an uzi from like 200 yards magically throught a window so idk,negative

This game is currently a hype If you have not heard about it you live behind a rock It is by far one of the most played games on steam and might break some console games in the top 10 this year so we pc master race can finally say its not just pokemon which is the most sold game well except it comes out on consoles then probably the console version of it itself will beat itself dayumIt is nothing new however neither in mechanics nor gameplay You can have the same game in thousand different ways since years but nobody until now cared Since none of them mixed it so well together with the east european armadayz style the correct amount of cold war era weaponry and the good hommage to the original movies of battle royaleIt is just a coincidence dayz got a huge amount of negative reviews recently for not finally finishing up while this early access game clearly can do it better with stock assets and stuffI do not recommend you to buy this if you still read comments to buy it I do recommend you to buy this if you want the game anyway since it s fun But make no mistake it has pro s and cons Pros    map with different highlights and theme parks stuffed with weapons and a circle that gets smaller   proven game concept straight execution literally   start with parachutes only after game lobby   burning people from lobby make nice effect on plane   voice chat optional thank the heavens   pan deflects bullets   100 player servers random teamups   instead of trying to pimp one of those half baked 3d engines like arma or h1z1 into becoming a shooter they successfully nerfed the unreal engine into feeling slightly less smooth but still better than the other alternatives   no arctic monkeys or acid rain just plain good old artillery   no rain in buildings   your skill in this game is visible on the amount of viewers on your twitch account   everybody in this game is a pro    not a starving simulator so no food and drink and stuff   so far no micro transaction based weapon drops   good to make streams because emergent gameplay and people watch it   no cover for your enemies because trees respect each others private space and grow far from each other or sometimes you even can enjoy that your building models do not load so you can just enjoy poor mans wallhack    you can get into a car of an enemy since its not just a mod from another game where the modder didnt figure out how to circumvent teams because the modder didnt have to write code Cons    no skill gameplay with little improvement curve   first person might make you think you are a hamster   some people are taking the molotovs and throw them away way to early in the lobby srsly   first come first served encounters   yes they said no microtransactions but then there was some and i include it but i dont care   more hackers than they admit but luckily who cares as long as the worst get banned from time to time   seriously who hacks in a game where no one gives a flying f  if you are good at it   unneccessary to blame yourself if you fail syndrome inclusive ragequits   eventual unwanted hunger on victory   you could make the same game after a week learning any 3d engine and buying assets in a store but you will never get rich by it so you can try the next best thing and spend as much time in steam market as you spend in playing this game solo because you think you have to exercise a gameplay that is based on a books someone wrote about russian roulette   because most people have voice off you cant play herbert the pervert   dont you get stuck on a prop or get killed by a player whose houses didnt load   refresh button is not the best solution for not being smart enough to integrate coherentui into your blueprint based UDK  code ,positive

A really solid games with a decent amount of issues The game is not near a full release considering it has performace issues and only 1 map as of this time with one on the way the game is set to launch with 2 maps which isn t enoughEdit  The new update has fixed SO MANY issues But they ruined the motorcycle Other than that it s pretty amazing needs work still but worth the money,positive

Nice fun little gamePlaying solo is very different from playing in a party Some people prefers one than the other but I like them both for their different playing stylesIn a solo game it s pretty chaotic at the beginning but more and more pressure at the end especially when you have reached the final 10Whereas in a party game 4 man squad moreso than 2 man duo it s more to do with cooperating and teamplay skills The game has several flaws but the biggest one at the moment is cheaters They are ruining the game severely810,positive

This game is fun but due to it s drastic increase in popularity the number of obvious hackers has increased as well I can only play one out of five games without there being either a speed hacker damage hacker or worst of all invincibility hack It s getting to the point that my friends and I take bets on what kind of hacker we ll encounter,negative

Amazing game maybe add a controls list for controler in the options,positive
Fortnite Battle Royale is a good contrast to see how much PUBG is a joke in terms of terrible performance and missplaced development priorities  loot crates before even basic gameplay stuff like good movement or fixing some large bugs like buildings not loading and people being able to see and walk through walls because of that  It s a different type of gameplay  Fortnite is much more arcade y has building and destruction systems so I m comparing them only on the more technical side of thingsLet alone the fact that PUBG developers seem to think that Twitch streamers are some sort of celebreties that must be the center of everyone s attention Most people just want to play games not watch someone with some sort of celebrety complex play them,negative
Been playing this game for about 2 months now Put about 68 hours in and i gotta say I am in love with this game Such a fun game to play squad or duo with friends I still have fun playing solo but playing by yourself doesnt give you a chance to be revived when knocked down obviously so i prefer having partners The team work and strategy involved and the intense interactions with the enemy make this game a blast to play Winner Winner Chicken Dinner,positive
If you want to be more alert play this game,positive
Everyone sees the obvious appeal that this game offers one way or another whether it be through obvious platforms like Twitch or Youtube or if they were just legitimately curious because they looked at the Steam page Regardless of what provoked people to buy the game I can say that it is in no way shape or form worth that bulky 30 price tag The idea of a fun game is there but the execution leaves a lot to be desired With problems ranging from unstable servers unoptimized game performance dull gameplay and the questionable behavior of the devs PUBG is an incomplete game and will most likely stay that way for a long while There are other games out there that provide a better experience and more unique gameplay for way lower prices sometimes even being available for FREE Unfortunately by the time I realized all the previously mentioned issues I had too much game time invested to refund this If you re on the fence about this game don t get it Go look at other games with this concept that are handled way better and can deliver more bang for your buck 30 effectively wasted,negative
It s great for a game on early access,positive

I see a lot of negative comments about the game however I think it s getting better every day Every game has positive and negative sides and do not forget that the game is still in early access And when I look back I can see that PUBG has come a long way since it was first released Despite bad optimisation fps drops and many more flaws PUBG broke the online player record and keeps improving itself because people love playing this game no matter what you say If you like playing survival games this game is definitely worth a shot,positive
Excellent PVP online actionalthough still in early access this game provides hundreds of hours of fun and intense gameplay,positive
Performance issues still unininteresting visual design insane dev team suing rivalsno thanks i d get a refund if i can,negative
Many compare this game to Fortnite however in my opinion they are 2 very different games Yes Battle Royale concept is there however PUBG is much less forgiving than Fortnite Positioning in this game is key in Fortnite you can just build your way out of trouble The feeling of being top 20 is very intense in this game very good late game However the mid game in PUBG is basically runningdriving simulator Half of your games you will chase the circle look for people but find none The problem is that majority of the people in a game are COD fanboys who drop to hotspot areas such as Hacienda and in the first 5 minutes of the game half the players are dead This makes the player density quiet low in the mid game and can get boring unless To get some action you have to drop in the same hotdrops as everyone else so the problem repeats PUBG should fix thisSound is absolute garbage in this game VERY loud vehicles guns and bombs I have to set my volume to low in order to avoid hearing loss It s that bad However that makes footsteps almost impossible to hear They should fix thatVERY buggy UNOPTIMISEd piece of crap 1 year old bugs still arent fixed PLENTY of Chinese hackers Developers do nothing to ban them Overall i think this game is very much worth the price however developers seem to be incompetent to fix their game  GREAT concept and fun but poor execution,positive
Overhyped Broken LOVE LOVE LOVE  Game How about you spend some money on fixing it instead of lawyers sicne the lawyers won t help regardlessAnd don t get me started on Game Director PLAYERUNKNOWN s massive EGOSincerely hope you lose your license to Unreal Engine you turd,negative
game is too busy please try again why can i like this when i try to go in almost 1 hour but can not play waste of time,negative
I think this is a great game Its fun to run around collect loot with your friends then try to make your way to the top However their are still multiple bugs that are very rage inducing like driving a vehicle and then hitting absolutely nothing and taking a lot of damage or the fact that half the time your just running to get to the zone and then the next zone is on the other side of the map again I would say the game is still really fun especially since its still in its early ages and Shooting mechanics are great the graphics are pretty good if u have a decent computer So overall I think this is a really good game for anyone who likes FPS games or survival games or even massively multiplayer games Id give this game 910 overall,positive

Firstly I do still believe in this game and desperately hope they can make the game we all wish we were playing when we run this hot mess I was going to hold off on reviewing the game until full release However with recent decisions being made by the development team their grace period for forgiveness in my eyes has ended This is quickly turning the way of DayZ With the title of  Biggest Game on Steam  comes a certain standard of quality or playability that is not being met For the first  40 hours I had a decent amount of fun There s a steep learning curve between the massive map different weapons and mil sim tactical gameplay all of which appeal to me as a gamer I could excuse the rampant bugs glitches and optimization issues since it was Early access and I knew what I was getting into purchasing this game in that state But as more of my friends bought the game and I spent more and more time in the world the issues that now cause this game to have a  Mixed  review rating became less subtle with every single match I entered This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poorly designed for competitve play Firstly there is no practice range or training mode  which is a basic essential for any competitive shooter That in itself wouldn t be as much of an issue but it requires the unpleasant experience of joining game after game simply to die in order to understand the game s mechanics Since there is no killcam or  death report  breaking down your damage received or given there is no way to tell whether you re even doing damage during an engagement A new player will die from seemingly nowhere and without the information on HOW they died or WHERE they were shot from it will discourage them from wanting to play I would describe this as  User Hostile  and deters players from coming back The number of friends I have with less than 5 hours on this game because of this exact issue is staggering I ve heard the arguments for how a Killcam or Death Recap would take away from the immersion or experience and while I can understand that point it s an invalid argument when put in the context of a competitive game You cannot grow without knowing how someone outplayed you There is no  get gud  when you re being left out to dry on exactly HOW you died so you can anticipate the same situation in the future and adapt to itNext the framerate stutters heavily even on the most powerful and expensive rigs I have a higher tier rig and I MUST play with most everything on  Very Low  to get close to 60 Ask any competitive gamer how important getting a steady 60 MINIMUM is for their performance Especially during gunfights when the game will inexplicably drop frames because LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you Finally we have the most glaring issue  server connections Between the MASSIVE desync and server connection problems I cannot reasonably call this game  competitive  There have been times where I have dropped from full health to none THEN I hear the gunshots after I am already dead I have been riddled with bullets and survived with no damage The number of times when I have been completely in cover THEN received hits from a few seconds ago is uncountable it happens nearly every single game This issue right here is what breaks the competitive play as what the server thinks is happening is NEVER 1 1 The amount of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t headshots I ve gotten on people most likely in cover on their games is equal to the number of times I ve been in total cover then received damage It s not a connection or ping issue this is a game issueI still have hope for this game I hope they can fix the frame stuttering the desyncing and make it more user friendly But until then while they continue to roll out new game content for a game with broken basics I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone,negative
was good but the past few weeks have been having server issues and cannot get to the main screen on the game without hitting refresh UI 1000 times seriously this game is going to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fast,negative
this game is tanking quickly servers don t allow you to access them without refreshing the ui multiple times but if you do this it counts as a login and your banned from logging in without even getting to the lobby screen,negative

Ever since they decided to add a report feature into the game its been on a huge downward spiral Not only is it extremely easy to abuse but on top of that they focus on fixing extremely small bugs and streamers needs rather than bugs like buildings rendering 30 seconds to a full minute after the match has begun or optimising the game for the majority of PCs I started playing at its height in late may to early june and i had few problems but as they update the game and  fix  bugs the  overall quality has suffered greatly The start of the game  If it doesn t crash takes quite long to load and then on top of that buildings refuse to load giving me and people having the same problem a great disadvantage when in even a low populated area Then if that isnt bad enough you can get shot through a wall because its not rendered for someone else Overall the game is awful and i cant recommend it in its current state  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game And its little dog too,negative
The game has become unplayable It will freeze every single game saying  network lag detected  although I have a superb internet connection and monster PC This happens on any serverI would only recommend buying if this issue is fixed or you will get very frustratedIf not fixed I ll see to get my money back,negative

As of the 10 launch the game runs much betterIt s still not perfect but game performance is much more acceptable In previous version I used to have to run the game on low  with a GTX 1060 to have anything close to 60fps  which would still regularly dip Now I can play it on high and get solid performanceIt still stutters at the start of a match but once you get going it stabilises and doesn t seem to affect most actual gameplayDeath cam is a nice touch too makes it much better to learn what I m doing wrong in gameswhy I m losingWhile I still think the game has been overhyped many of the laws have at least been ironed out,positive
its so lagy,positive
This is my first computer game in a long time  Its a good game crazy concept  Its easy to pick up hard to kill people   But its all practice  I get stuck in a zone and look up and Ive been playing for 3 hours  Lol  So you will get hooked on it as well Im sure,positive

A very fun squadsolo based loot and shoot Still needs some optimization but very fun all around The game play is pretty smooth improves with almost every monthly update They ve had several server issues recently but it s understandable with a early access game that blew up so fast Currently sitting at 90 hours we ll worth the 50 per hour at this point how I justify purchases ,positive
Don t listen to the naysayers the game is pretty awesome  It s early access so yeah it has it s issues but it s not some POS that deserves negative reviews Great game there s a reason it s number 1 played game on Steam and number 1 watched game on Twitch,positive

I normally dont write reviews but this game is annoying The first time I tried this game I ran around forever trying to find someonenothing and then got shot by a sniperno big deal I tried again Kept putting me on an asian server No big deal right I changed to a US server it took that and proceded to put me on an asian server No one in games due to time difference and if someone was in the game they only spoke asian Cant understand anyone This game has WAY too many bugs,negative
This game is so much fun but the constant network lag makes it unplayable I often lag out multiple times a game I hope they resolve the issues promptly or they re going to lose a customer,negative

This game is a joke  does not show the server ping   you can not choose suitable server  guns are unbalanced   sub machine guns give more damage than shotguns and assualt rifles  doesn t need skill   just depends on who shoots first and camps better  maintaining the population by giving out crates  damage hits are RNG based,negative

It s a great game Each player helps to create an elaborate collection of small narratives which describe the travels into the circleWorth picking up for 30 and playing with friendsFor all the reviews that give a negative with less than 50 hours played  especially those under 20 I wouldn t put much weight behind those It s clear most of those reviews are people upset at the game and copy pasting other negative reviews,positive
Needs a lot of work before cosmeticsAs of 5817 this game is still a buggy messIt s 112817 and there still isn t any performance patchesfixes  Doesn t look like Bluehole gives a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about optimization  The only  optimization  I hear of is through the test server notes not the actual game,negative

Game is addicting Win or lose got to play just one more game,positive
This game excites me because of its different ways of playing The winner does not merely rely on his technique but also his tactic and sometimes the luck HoweverThe server of this game fails to provide players who pay so much money for this game with a stable connection It breaks down for several times a day sometimes when you pick up a Kar98 or MK14and then the connection is lost Apparently they fail to reckon that more than a million players would play this game but they have not showed any sign of compensation or action to robust the server The only reaction is damned and plain apologise on the social media apps which looks more like an irony rather than an apologise,negative
if you like shooting people point blank with shotguns and then dieing its not a bad game,negative
Awful optimisation I don t have the best computer in the world but it s better than the minimum recommendation by a fair bit However most matches I struggled to have a decent consistent frame rate Whether that s the servers or what I don t know but it rendered the game unplayable for me as I couldn t compete Thus I got a refund Don t believe the hype at the moment I may revisit once it s out of early access,negative

Fun game to play but too many cheaters and no effective methods were used to stop them No need to waste your money,negative
This is literally all my friends want to play There are much better games yet we keep playing this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game Id rather take the casino royale chair treatment than play another match of this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Still its something to play and serves as decent background to conversations and If I dont take it too seriously both kills and deaths can be mildly entertaining Honestly the Pre game lobby is the best part about this game I cant bring myself to give it a negative review Its not terrible its just something to do while youre talking to people 9110  IGN,positive
Someone took my name,negative
nice concept but incompetent implementation server issues every day lag every day connection problems every day these days and weeks if it works it can still be fun but anyway i am honestly wondering what is happening with these game devs and their priorities,negative
The game is fun and intense  however the poor optimization and horrible servers outweigh the good,negative
This will be my first review so bear with me This game is excellent that much I can say It has numerous pro s that come in a nice sweet bundle of explosions and confusion on where to go next Some might even call it a walking simulator Regarless here are my points and opinions on the game that has been on the top of Steam Charts for months PROS        Graphics  They are nice and pretty something to be expected for a shooter that takes on a  realistic  approach       Weapons  Nice wide variety You can get things ranging from close quarters to distance however your playstyle is       Loot  Like in weapons good variety of stuff to grab and use from medicine to heal you or a pan to beat your enemies        Cooperative  It is great to be able to play with friends either in Duo s or Squads More the merrier       Replayability  This is an important factor to me If I get salty over losing I can pop into another lobby in seconds and get back to it which is amazing You do not have to wait forever for a lobby        Locations  There is a wide area of places you can duke it out with other players from cities to small farms to open fields do not fight in fields ends badly most times Onto the Cons  Cons        Graphics  Even though it is a Pro it is also most surely a Con as well After nearly 7 months of EA release this game still doesnt have the optimization that it needs yes hundred of millions of dollars does not fix things code is hard as will be explained in Connection See Below But it does not allow you to let it go for so long FIX IT and the game will be amazing        Connection  Here is my major issue or one them The connection to servers is trash No matter what server you play on the first minute of the game is so laggy it is unbelieveable You fight with doors loot and PEOPLE I have died so many times when I could not pick up some ammo for a gun when somebody landed near me Before I can load my gun from the intense lag he literally one shot punches my head and I am downed That leaves a bad taste in my mouth They mentioned that they would look into it but still nothing has done anything Also side rant you will see many Chinese players complaining as of late Apparently there is an AD that pops up in their home screen of PUBG charging money due to no server in Chine This is why NA has so many Chinese players on it I personally feel that Bluehole should get their bags of money and fix it This game might have LEGIONS of fanboy s which it does trust me they are not your friends but I dislike it when other players cannot enjoy a game as much as me in America Hearts to Chineses players      Damage Ratio  I get it it is hard to get a gun to do  fair  damage But when a grenade lands next to someone and doesnt down them there has to be a problem Thankfully that has been somewhat addressed recently but still bugs me to death everytime I can lob 7 grenades at a team in a house and not down one Git gud I guess  sigh                          Side not on damage I swear even with full tier 3 gear you will die faster than a bug being squashed every player is sooooooo bad that they can hit your arms and legs which will deal full damage to you I have ben shot once and nearly 90  of my HP was gone No headshot either Just another rant      Community  This game is getting to the point of LoL Saltier than a salt mine You kill them and oh my they blow a fuse I know I do hahaha But it s the fanboys that ruin this game They take the game so serious asking about stats leaderboards how skilled you are etc Listen this game requires little skill simply put That will salt mine numerous players but it is the truth After nearing 500hrs which isnt much compared to some people I can say this You can literally hide and move quiet to the end and get last kill and BOOM you win It is all RNG and Luck Luck on who you run into where the circle is located if you have good gear etc RNG because its random on if you will have good loot weapons vehicles etc A plethora of issues that trump Skill      Fanbase cont  This last part is about streamers in particular This will be beating a dead horse I know but it must be addressed again The Devs love the streamers more than the community These guys draw attention money advertising you name it But they do not get punished when needed Sometimes they do but rare from what i have seen They also held a tournament for them yes  you heard me a touney for streamers 5 months in EAwith an added gift to the community ready for itMICROTRANSACTIONS YES YOU CAN BUY CRATES TO GET CLOTHES Welp anywho the devs promised not to do that but did Streamers get loads of people banned for streamsniping too its a new drama as of late I get worried that one day I will kill one not knowing who it is and get banned I do not even watch streams I couldnt name a popular one That is how much I care for them but I get this from different news sources and friendsFINAL VERDICT  THUMBS DOWN     After the above it is true I will still play it but only because my friends play it a lot I would not recommend it in the current state If you wanna try something with decency try Fortnite by EPIC Free to play and looks fun Hope you enjoyed my honest review and good luck out there     EDIT      After a few more hours put in I can officially say this game is not a game that can be considered for eSports or anything of the skill related I am a salty player by this point I report well over ten people a day at an average due to cheating This game is worse then FortNite in the sense that in FortNite you do not see that many Chinese cheaters PERIOD PUBG is killing itself every passing day Idc about patches to the M 16 for no 8X IDC about the Red Bull can update or the canoe that can speed through the water ALL I WANT IS FOR PUBG TO REGION LOCK CHINA AND CRACK DOWN ON CHEATING Plus the servers are still absolute garbage It is sad that I must admit that the EA Version of this game was superior in many ways to the final garbage finish I am disgruntled yes but I will continue to play not out of having fun but out of a necessity to prove this game is not good and the community deserves better Not just NA but EU and every other server being overinflated with Chinese gamers and cheaters I feel horrible that the small group of Chinese that want to have fun with other servers cannot since a vast majority of their playerbase funds this garbage game and allows for so many cheaters to exist What is even more sad is the fact that the Dev s will not touch anything realted to Chinese cheating simply because as mentioned over 50  of players are Chinese So Dev s you really do not deserve top 10 on Steam Store this flith needs fixing And if people knock on me for continuing to play so be it but at least I will have evidence of the cheating,negative
Pretty fun and easy to get the hang ofNew changes coming seem to be a step in the right direction,positive
Amazing game A little frustating since there is people who are pro players and you could be pitted against them even though this may be your first FPS If they add a ranking system it would fix this problem Also this game is best with friends if I play alone I tend to die more and get more mad Overall one of my favorite games of the year,positive

veri nice game would play again,positive
EDIT    now that the game has released if you can even call it a release as blue hole want to work on extra content and gun balancing after 10 release hahahah well that just means its still a beta game but now they have released they have no obligation to add or fix anything im throughally dissapointed in the amount of launch content and i dont really think its enough to bring me back to the gameive got to say im with the negatives here the game has been out 6 months and theyve added pretty much no contentfixed some things but the amount of work there is left to do to get this game up to a working standardits going to take them yearsalso the only real fun part of the game is when your in a fire fight but when your not be prepared to be running to the safe area for 20 mins and looting houses finding the same LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pistols or nothing at all this game is only just bearable to play with friends because at least you have someone to talk to other wise its boring as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lolif they can fix the graphics the bugs add more vehiclesweaponsmapscustomisation optionschange the pacing then i might come back otherwise id much rather play some other game x,negative

This game is still not very well made the shooting mechanics are all over the place and the issue with many different types of aimbotters or laggers   mostly chinese  ruin the game especially the shooting mechanics the guns have no feel to them and are animated horribly,negative
I ve played this game now for almost 90 hours I had some fun with friends it WAS niceI m quite disappointed how bad it actually still runs on a good computer I would have expected it to be optimized more by now Waiting for friend to come online can take as much as 3 minutesI can definitely say that I hate the desert map There is no way where you can select a mapI hate the way you cannot really control what you pickup from the floor which results in changing pants 10x before picking the weapon you really need You can also press  TAB  but then you won t see your surroundingsI get tired of having to wait more than a minute before every game and than spending another minute or two in a plane or in the sky before the game actually starts  There are some bugs in this game are not acceptable  getting stuck in the world invisible walls while driving and there is a bug in which you won t get your BP after a gameSpeaking of which  you played a lot of battles trying to collect as much BP as you can for a chest Only to find out you need to BUY a key of 200 to open the chestAnd last but not least  cheaters,negative

Too many time bad sever please quickly improve,negative
Promising gameplay disapointing performanceFor those who want only the very best out of their hardware investments other titles such as DayZ and ArmA are largely disapointing With the promise of higher framerates a more mature graphics engine and the potential for Nvidia SLI support many players are drawn to PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS seeking a refreshing experience Unfortunately this game largely fails to improve upon any of the aforementioned title s performance and leaves any enthusiast with the familiar taste of poor framerates stuttering artifacting and crashing Explosive titles such as PUBG are important reminders that engine integration optomization and validation simply must come first before other superficial improvements are made I look forward to the day that I am able to concede and edit this review under the pretense that all of the performance issues have been resolved but given the trend of the market sadly I cannot forsee this happening within a reasonable time,negative
The game has challenge for everybodyIf you likeyou can buy the gameYou can face to much challenge on the gameI hope you love this game,positive
Initially this was a negative review Now however I can finally recommend PUBG They fixed the lag they ve optimised the game and it s servers dropped a new map and a dozen new guns As of launch after the usual launch hiccups it works It just works And it s about LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing time,positive
this game is good could be great but like others say the optimization is weak for now but i still run great FPS with a little tuning but im not sure about strem sniper crap because i never watch people stream i usually play lol but all in all great game it has good patchs and they re devs are always updating stuff unlike ubisoft or some other big comapanys,positive

Heres the rundown of a typical match  fly in the plane and wait for all the lemmings to jump to hotspots and wait for a good spot for yourself usually near the end of the flight path Spend the next 10 15 minutes looting and running to the circle encounter noone else 3 play area restrictions left encounter one of the 15 people left in the game You headshot them 5 times and they dont die despite wearing a level 1 helmet they proceed to whirl around and tag you one time in the head and prove that you ve just wasted your time and effort since strategy and skill mean nothing in this game Dont waste your time on this steaming pile of crapPost release has no change if not actually being worse thanks to new loot crates that draw out all the aimbotters Stil a waste of time,negative
the developers are a bunch of babies and need to grow up,negative
YES I KNOW ITS EARLY ACCESSThe community isn t a very nice one from what i ve played anywaysthe end game also why cant it be the white circle goes to a certain size then the game gets a timer The lag  nuff saidframe rate dropsbugs n glitchesthis thing called stream sniping I DONT EVEN WATCH TWITCH STREAMERS and i got banned boring map the need to bring out more content faster bad gun mechanicsBad driving machanics,negative
Thought it was going to be good but no it s another slow LOVE LOVE LOVE  forever in Early Access Game on top of being banned for killing a streamer where s my refund Edit Oh LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing boy I must be a COD LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er how dare I even say anything about this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  little game continue to defend scumbag devs,negative
THIS REVIEW IS FOR PEOPLE THAT DON T KNOW IF THEY WANT THIS GAME To start off this game is S HIT  OH it s in early access the game is not going to be prefect  they can t patch the little kids that sit in the same room for the whole game  HUGE HUGE BUG  in the game You jump into the game and run across the map to get into the circle just to get shot by the guy thats been there the whole time waiting for you The game sometime won t open Crashes when exiting a game and in game jumping around might get you killed if you get stuck in part of the map  very common                          THIS GAME OVERALL IS S HIT DON T BUY ANYONE THAT SAYS OTHERWISE IS LYING TO YOU AND THEMSELVES,negative
Awesome game r8 7810 why  coz i ve seen many people get banned for being accused of stream snipe and the performance isn t quite good so yeh fix it ye c nt,negative
I can t even open the game It keeps crashing I tried many things from google and youtube but still can t fix the problem Some people has the same problem as me so i don t reccomend this since this is still an early access I ll update my review if my problem has been fixed and i am able to play it,negative
After playing it for awhile I dont like it Cancerous game Devs need to work on making this game better Optimize it better and fix the terrible community surrounded by this game It s as bad as the COD community,negative
Educational game that shows you the risk of driving a motorcycle,positive
After playing this game for almost a year and with almost 400 hours invested in it I realy hoped the developers would fix the countless bugs and glitches at some point but I lost faith and I can only hope that no one will shove more money up the a     of this lazy developers  NOT RECOMMENDED,negative
the server sucks I cannot reach the menu,negative
The servers of this game is trash and they are not likely to fix it recently,negative
Optimization still sucks after 6 months  the game lags even on high end machines and medium settingsLately there have been a lot of server problems that shouldn t exist at this stage since the game is already very popularIt almost seems like as the developers don t care to fix the servers or optimization but prefer to add weapons and features that nobody actually wantsFun game to play although optimization and server problems ruin the experience,negative
bought it at first and was playable and very nice after 1 month and a few updates all i get when i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing start the game are   servers are busy   connection lost   go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yourself we dont care about the players anymore since we earned enough money ,negative

Bad omptimization banning people for killing streamers and worst of all going after smaller games because  They are in the same genre therefore they are copying us  Screw you PU,negative
Player Unknown s Battlegrounds or PUBG is a game in the battle royale sub genre of the firstthird person shooter market  The basic premise is 100 players drop onto a large map filled with numerous buildings villages towns and other major structures such as a prison and airport  Your job is simple  Kill everyone else and be the last man standingThe idea isn t original by any means as H1Z1 king of the kill came before but PUBG has produced a somewhat slicker and more technically stable product though that isn t to say it isn t stable all the time  The semi regular patching cycle does fix and add new items but it also breaks the servers for long periods or creates odd bugs that can persist for days at a time  This happens nearly everytime but they do fix the issues pretty fast so it isn t unstable for longIt isn t all solo shooting as you and upto three friends can battle in squads to be the last squad standing and honestly this is the way the game should be played  While solo has it s moments being in a duo trio or full four man team creates some really memorable moments and if you can get friends to play with you the game is so much more fun  There is also a first person only mode that is currently in beta at the time of writing for those who prefer that view mode for playPlayers can use a variety of weapons from pistols smg s shotguns marksmen rifles sniper rifles assault rifles and light machine guns  Some are obviously better than others and usually you will want to scavenge as much as possible to find the best gear  Vehicles are also available but they are strictly for transport so don t expect to take tanks or APC s but hell you can run people over for a few quick killsProbably the most contentious issue is the store which isn t asking for micro transactions but items bought using the coins earned in matches can be sold on the steam market place  So expect to see items on there for incredible sums of money for no reason other than it s apparently rare  Luckily the store only rewards clothing and not items like weapons or skins for those weapons  Though give it timeIn summary the game is good but does need work to fix some server side issues and expand the content to add more map types and game features though these are in the works  Remember it s an early access title and so you should be aware that one day it might work and the next it won t because updates happen and the game changes,positive
THE GOOD  constant 120 fps without any stutter since 10  GTX 970 and an i7 4790k  lots of memorable moments through gameplay  very short queue times  kill camTHE BAD  MASSIVE problem with cheaters  garbage netcode going anywhere from 4 40 tick rate  getting killed can be very frustrating with no time to react  ingame voice chat do yourself a favor and turn it off  devs that ban people without any proof of stream sniping  only 2 maps to play on one of which is terribly designed,negative
funny game but too much resource demandingWith a MSI Geforce 1080 6GB i play this game on low at 100 fps,positive
If you don t have the best of the best build like I do you won t run this game worth a lick Almost everyone I know struggles violently to even run the game let alone do anything worthwhile while playing Even if I can find a teammate we re almost always at a numbers disadvantage 20  of the time the parachute just stops working and you take unexplained fall damage Sometimes it even kills youThe sounds are delayed The shots desync far more than they should Client side hit registration Extremely high damage fluctuation to the point where shotguns can either one shot you from afar or take six shots point blank to the face or neither Grenade toss arches are lies Bullet drop is the same for every ammo type except for one specific gun Crate drops have a 30  chance to help you slightly and a 70  chance to pin you between four teams and touch your booty in unwanted ways The game being early access might excuse slight desync or bugs but not this You ll die so many sketchy deaths and not know if it was a cheater bug exploit or position desync caused by the 20 tick servers 20 ticks That s Minecraft level LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  right there not a Steam best sellerThe game is extremely fun and it has a load of unlocked potential but until that potential is tapped and the game is fixed I can t recommend buying it unless you have a really good build andor friends with really good builds,negative
Do I recommend this game  Based on the price tag and how much game play I have received for it yesI have not been a victim to the bans from the whole streamer thing but that does seem to be a concern Will the devs continue to support the game and develop it as I would expect an early access title to do so  Remains to be determainedBut for the content that is currently here 30 is a fair price   so I recommend it It s a fun game I enjoy it,positive

Don t buy this game Wait until it becomes less expensiveTHings wrong with the game Bumping into cars instantly kills you Melee weapons are useless because players run away at the same speed you re chasing them Abundant hackers Errors and downtime more common than other games,negative
Please fix the bug which causes you to spin around and explode while going with a motorcyle The game is very buggy and needs a lot a fixes before actually it is playable I have never seen such a disappointing game with so much promise Game doesnt need cosmetic items It needs optimisation bug fixes and more maps Bluehole please address these issue and remove the red zone It doesnt make any sense Also there so many cheaters the game is basically unplayable,negative

Pretty boring  Mostly a waste of time  Everyone just sits in a spot and camps until they absolutely need to move  Not exactly what some would call FUN  Also great when you shoot someone 8 times with an assault rifle and they just walk away like no big deal  Too many idiots with microphones screaming prematch and in the airplane waiting to drop,negative
               This is for people who speak English  A million anchor was being video hung and many believed it and the authorities did not respond for a week   Blue Hole is in the shelter of supporting software  Because regardless of whether he has used auxiliary software  You are the official you want to answer this question  Otherwise I personally think this is the possibility of shielding you from using assistive softwareThe above words are google translationmy english is very poor   so  you konwi hope i can help you and thanks for watch this,negative
And another looting simulator so I will explain what  I ve felt playing this game Loot for 30 minutes Camp half of the game or rush some one and die if you choose the camping game you will still get same results or get lucky and win a game but most games I ve played I looted for half of the game camped for another half died And it happens over and over and over again When we win we get BP points to buy crates that are useless because you deffinetly going to get nothing but a red T shirt or some other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE I recommend this game for people that have friends  unlike me 610,negative

Love the idea but hate the implementation I don t understand who decided to sell broken and absolutely not optimised game Serioulsly this is not a joke we pay for that game and we expect R D department will work on graphic issues and optimisation this is unplayable I have feeling that you guys do not have QA department which sucks but if you have one than it even worse because you pay them for nothing this state of the product is absolutely not ready for selling EVEN for the early access program which I have feeling will never ends  Please hear our voices focus all power on the client side and make this game smooth and joyful to play because it hurts,negative
It is your job and responsibility to ensure that we can enjoy the game You do not try hard to improve the server performance instead you sell us advertisement We cannot tolerate this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ,negative

I never bought this game because I thought it was LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Now that I have bought it I don t play this game because I know it is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  The only reason I bought it in the first place is so that I can play it with my friends There is SO much stuff wrong with this game This game has to be one of the most poorly executed games I have ever played Gun play is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  player control is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  graphics aren t very good and the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Boy oh boy the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing servers I haven t been able to play at all today because the servers are down AGAIN Even when they are up the connection is horrible and you will lag no matter how fast your internet is If the devs actualy get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together and fix this game up then it would be fun but for now the only time it is ever fun is if you re playing with friends and are just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing around,negative
I completely recommend this game I have only got 42 hours in this game but it was time well spent I have enjoyed driving around the map exploring areas Collecting and experimenting with new guns and attempting to kill people I have only got 64 kills as i am not very good at the game but i do enjoy playing it I also have not ever won a game of PUBG but i do enjoy playing it The game is so much better than H1Z1  King of the kill For example the way killing players works is so much better in PUBG This makes it easier for me to kill players I also really like the scopes and upgrades for guns as this was not available in KOTK I would 100  recommend this game to anyone who was asking me about it because it packs in hour and hours of fun,positive

My gameplay goes one of two ways 1 Drop in get into a firefight and get killed straight away Spend more time in the queue than in game2 Drop away from the action loot for 30 minutes make it to the top 10 seeing nobody and then die shamefullyI don t have 5 10 years of shooter experiene to be competitve in this game This makes the game unejoyable for me as I will predominantly lose to anyone I come against  after looting for some time The game has too much looting and not enough action to be fun It is unforgiving to noobs espicailly in solo The game is fun to play with friends  particularily with ones who can carry If you have a lot of active friends who play the game I would actually recommend it However my overall experience has been depressing and I no longer have any desire to play this gamePros  Realistic Graphics  Is fun when you re good Has very intense moments Enjoyable with friendsCons  Long periods of no action Not 0ptimised at all Glitchy and laggy Play for 30 mins and see nobody then get one shot from 200m away No fun for noobs,negative
The game is a great concept  But think this way you and your friend are finishing the end of a game and get double headshooted with a guy with no recoil to his gun and this happens once  no this happens every game you pay 2999 for a game that your   winner winner chicken dinner  is stolen by a hacker it makes the game unfun to play when every other encounter with a player is a hacker  I wouldnt play this game you will be robbed of your time and hard work unless bluehole gets off there butts and fixes this it is unacceptable that a person pays with their hard earned money to be a crappy experience do yourself a favor a support a company who goes the extra mile to make the game fair  good game bad and uncaring developer,negative

i have played this game for 27 hours by the time writing this and the best thing to happen to me so far was the time me and my friend was chasing some random alone dude in like a orange volvo and we were getting shot from every direction and we kept chasing the guy across the entire map untill we lost him and i got shot in the face in full speed so i flew out of the car and in to a mountain like 104kmh heads first and died and my mate just laughed and died lol shoutout to mah mate he didnt even try to save his friends life and i just realised that this whole review is one single long sentance lol ok i give the game a 45 bruh cuz it runs out of memory like 247 so it kinda annoying but its early access babyyy im sure it will get fixed later ok buy this game for your grandmother or somthing  profit  ,positive

EDIT  While the issues that i listed below are still extremely present a much larger and worse issue has taken hold of this game It is so cancerously filled with people cheating and they are basically doing nothing to prevent it Simply soft banning people I honestly believe this is to pump their numbers They desperately need to IP ban players Long time players like myself are sick of thisThe optimization for this game is atrocious I am running a decently high end build 7600k 16 gbs of ram and 980ti This game perfroms worse nearly everytime i hit play Zero performance issues in all of my other games I love this game and do recomend it for whats good about it However they really need to take some time and optimize it because running sub 60 with my build is absolutely unacceptable and should be for other players with a similar build as well Get your S    together bluehole I know this is early access but i cant make excuses for it anymore,negative
best lol,positive
Well well time to  re visit  my reveiwSo they didnt fix the community  read  chinese yet but they DID a good job with anti cheatThey also fixed a good bunch of performance problems  i can finally run the game on Ultra graphicsFINALLYThey also sort of fixed the car physics or maybe i didnt run into any wierd LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lately    I have to say my faith in Bluehole has been restored They did a decent job with fixing the gameAs it stands i can reccommend the game now,positive

I love this game literally its my daily play at this point and it ll continue to be for a good while Pros good graphics fairly easy to run is you do necesarry actions for bad pc s good times with your buds Cons RNG flight path RNG circles RNG loot esport readyhonestly though this game is in early access and if you can ignore the petty bugs this is an amazing game this is a must have if you love shooters as I do,positive
Definitely don t recommend this game as it is now  yeah I know it s a beta There are too many suspect cheaters and the lag is horrendous Maybe 3 shots out of 6 will hit the same target without moving Not to mention that some guns just magically penetrate level 2 and level 3 helmets no problem Definitely wait on this game till release,negative
Pros and cons first summary lastPros  Great combat system High skill cap Good players rewarded  most of the time Many ways to win Guns are decently realisticCons  Unoptimized Rng elements Buggy Feels clunky God awful movementSummary PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds better known as PUBG is a thirdfirst person battle royale shooter which brings many new mechanics to the battle royale genre From gun realism  bullet drop etc to choice of landing for lootingfighting PUBG is a good mix between the seriousness of Arma 3 s battle royale and H1Z1 s gimmicky gameplay There are many good things this game has going for it  skill cap fun guns clown fiesta locations and many more While these elements exist some negative elements co exist with them To name a few textures not loading in for a good  10 20 seconds until you land which also means you can t go in buildingsland on top lucky people who are worse than you Rng crate drops and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  plane flight paths I ve noticed lately that optimization mainly textures loading in is a big issue I ve also experienced way more crashes when trying to land out of my parachute as it seems the game just stops and dies I understand this game is early access but I believe that is becoming the same excuse H1Z1 used so they wouldn t get bashed for an unfinished game I believe that in 50 weeks some of these easily addressable issues such as clunky movement would have been solved About 20 weeks in they stated they were working on a vault mechanic and even had footage of it It has been 30 weeks since and we have heard nothing on it Although there are many things this game could improve on I believe it is a top 10 realease of 2017 and will continue to thrive for the coming years Buy this game,positive
Love the game format love the gun mechanics love the spatial sounds Terribly unoptimized lack of game modes lack of maps A lot of Asian players on North American servers with crazy lag and netcode advantagesAdd all of this up and its STILL a badass mf n gamejust need more maps and maybe a developer who speaks english and can work with the Unreal engine,positive
