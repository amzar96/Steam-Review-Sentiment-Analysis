good game i like this game RECOMENDED
Netcode is 210 still but it s pretty alright I guess
Dsync lag hackers campers  don t even play solo if you don t want to play camp simulator useless things  such as red zone that s how I can describe itThis game has nothing to do with skill it is all about luc lag dsync camping better and hoping to not meet the hackersThey spend way more time resources and interest in the mobile version   how do we milk money out of them   rather than making this game the bestIt has potential but they don t care
Extremly low FPS using 1060 but FPS can drop from 120 to 50 espacially in the last few zones unable to play
play aggressive or gtfo
not optimized
its a game i guess I dont think anyone should buy or play it
Other than the veeeery questionable and ridiculous microtansactions a very good game
Game was fun good promise Game is unplayable now nonstop network lag detected and it s not my connection nor my hardware Know issue for awhile and nothings being done to fix it
i have this weird texture but over all its ight
really nice game i love it great price but they have to fix the sound  3 i love the game tho
it s arma but without any of the things that make arma fun
1010 would bang
esports ready
this game shows you how to get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  by 4 pepole
Havent once been banned yet besides an error when attempting to reconnect  i think i left lobby right at the worst second People who complain about stream snipers either need to suck it up or move on to a different game The people who complain about getting a temp ban for repeadetly killing the same streamer or trying to are even bigger cry babies Game is really fun it s still early access Advice  Turn off all chat while in lobbyPlane turn it back on when you land for fun times If your watching someones stream and intentionally going after them your playing the game wrong move on to something else If you attempt to stream snipe a hundred times and get merked by the streamer and finally the 101st attempt you kill him and you get banned the next day Stop QQ and moar Pew Pew cry babies
2 hit pan that blocks bullets1010
Great game 
Good game fix the servers though becuase i cannot play however excluding that the rest of the game is good and would recommend it and it is good to play with friends  You can play alone but it is better with friends
very poorly optimized
Not impressed The audio is absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trash The direction of fire is the opposite direction then the direction i am being shot from Its just not fun to play anymore sticking to fortnite
Very bad support from developersPlease fix your 10 Update and listen to your customers before introducing new maps and skinsWhat s the point of introducing new feature when half of the pubg community can t even get past the match making screenHope you take this seriouslyThank you
fu   server
really fun
I love playing this game so much But the thing is I never get to play it anymore because the game wont even load into the menu due to too many people or  Failed to Initialize steam 
Concept wise this is the best battle royale game out there but if we look at everything else this game is the worst I enjoyed it at first but the more you play the more you resent this game It has endless graphics bugs sometimes you start the game with wallhack and no clip and you have an unfair advantage over other players And theres even more ways to cheat your way through the game like removing fog so you can see further removing terrain textures so you can see better around trees and rocksFurthermore the games engine is awfully unoptimized and you cannot run it on a decent gaming computer I ve got a high end gaming laptop and all i can squeeze is 40 fps at best with all settings on low and even some extra changes in my video card settings If you want to run this smoothly on medium graphics youre laptop should be in the 15k 2k eurodollar price range and for desktops it should be somewhere around 1kDeveloper wise it seems that all they care about is making profit because they are rolling out these alpha at best game copies for 30 euros   not including micro transactions for in game items that give you advantage in game full of bugs The game is worse now than it was 2 3 weeks ago When i first bought this game i could run it kind of smoothly on 40 fps  right now the average fps i get is 25 30 It seems that theyre breaking the game even more Not to mention the game stutters that occur between updates With one update they fix some stuff but they break something else Theres endless audio voice glitches too If you want to use the ingame communication   you re out of luck Your microphone sometimes stops working mid game and you have to restart it just to get it back going Also the sound of the game cuts out but it usually comes back within couple of secondsI WOULD NOT recommend you buying this game at the current state Because this is the worst 30 euros i have spent on a game EVER I really enjoyed playing this game at first but the bugs cheaters and developer attitude towards customers are making us furious Hopefully something changes in the near future if not this game will die in a couple of months

developers focus on gameplay ffs
Half LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  developer at every stageNew  ping  matchmaking just forced all the chinese hackers from the NA servers where they cant get to into OCE where its now unplayableDon t support this joke of a company
nice game
Whatever game made Pewdiepie say the n word must be legit Pretty Litty
This Game Is Fun I played it for like 5 Hours But The Thing Is Good People Just Pick On People That Are No Where as Good as them So It Never gives a good chance for the new players at least they can throw in some tutorial but no your just put out there this is just my sillly personal opinion but people can think what they want to
Amazing
i built my rig because of this game
The devs are absolutely horrible peopleIf they got their way then no game for the rest of eternity would be allowed  gasses solids liquids plasma and any other form of matter or not matterDo not support their products or their practices
its ok
FIX THIS GAME YOU PICE OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   ONLY JUST CRASH AT STATR TEST SERVER NOT WORKING  FIX YOUR GAME YOU CANT
So far haven t been able to launch the game without it crashing  I7 with GTX 1070Even after a 5GB and 1GB update
Best game ever
Heaven Sent
Most frustrating dying simulator everGame is good tbh but optimialisation is fooked up atm Hope they will fix it soon
In Short Terms  The game is insanely smooth when playing on other servers massive update pouring at pretty much beating its predecessors H1Z1 I strongly suggest trying out this game if you are into PVP battle royal type of games The game has to offer a lot of customization to the character and is still producing content every week with update and major update adding new clothing and new hairstyle etc This is one of the few games I ve seen that has constant content update all around with clothing new hairstyle faces weapons and maps  In The Long Terms  PlayersUnknown Battlegrounds PUBG Is a PvP Battle Royal King of the Hill style type of game where you parachute down and loot moving from point a to point b and so on the circle start out big were everyone has to get to and gradually overtime the circle gets smaller until there is one 1 man or team surviving depending on your play style The reason why I recommend this game over most of the other Battle Royal type of games that is similar to this is that there is a lot of depth to the game there a lot of guns and attachment you can put on the weapon that you have to loot for Character Customization is the biggest factor that i love about this game is that most games around battle royal or pvp start to lack in customization update adding new hairstyle this is something I enjoy when there updates because it doesn t give you that feel of looking at the same old character look and clothing as well being also updated  Weapons And Attachements  The weapons and attachments in this game is more in depth then most battle royals games where they come attached or no attachments at all depending on the game PUBG gives you a stock weapon when you loot then having to go search and loot for the attachments giving you weapon more value or an advantage against other players Weapons in PUBG can be vary from shotguns sub machine guns rifles DMR AR and pistols There are also weapons known as Crate weapons that when a plane comes by dropping off a a red crate containing rare weapons that can only be found in the crate like certain type of weapons The only thing that didn t really bother me but could be found in other games was skins PUBG in its current state do not offer any weapon skins and this is one of the things that i found to good thing in my opinion i feel like games that are to focus on make weapon camo should be more of the last thing on their list Clothing and Character Customization  Now I feel like they did great on this adding new clothes and hairstyle and still releasing update giving you more option their on that i do wish that had longer female hairstyle instead of a standard ponytail The game offers a lot of clothing from boxes you can buy weekly i don t like how the percentage are constantly getting the same item but i do enjoy how they have a bunch of different stuff in each box and hoping that their would be higher rates on items that have higher rarity because i feel like they don t increase the chance after hoping X amount of boxes  Servers PUBG servers are one of the best server i seen for playing international wise This is one of the few games I ve seen were i can play on another server that not my countrycontinent and have no lag issues i play from NA but on AS servers and sometimes EU and usually have no lag the only time I m ever having lag is when their new update that caused a issue with the game they need to fix or if the NA server are stupidly overfill but beside from that playing on other server only have like a 3 sec delay at times Vehicles The vehicles in this game can use a lot of improvement so far this is one of the main issue I ve had with this game is when the 2 seat motorcycle randomly turn or spazzes out causing me to go down and the three seat motorcycle being stupidly hard to turn There is a couple vehicle that do feel smooth then most and that is the buggy doesn t spazz out nor cause hard turns I do like how the vehicles in the game doesn t force you to carry parts and only require gas vs in H1Z1 you need all the car parts in order to use the car as in motors wheels engine and etc etc Pros and Cons  Pros  Customization  In depth weapons Constant Updates Realistic Sniping Stable Connection Steam Market Cons  Not easy for new shooters Horrid Community on Voice Chat Bullet Distance Accounted For Unstable after updates Micro transaction  key crates Technical Stuff h1 1 If you are having a hard seeing from far away because the game isn t  sharpen enough or having a hard time to see through window and have max settings and a beefy computer i suggest you get Reshade installing this to your game will sharpen and improve your game costing you some FPS if you don t have a beefy computer2 Ultra Vs Low graphics low graphics lowering the foliage and everything makes it easier to find your target but a the same time can cost you the fact of not knowing if your hidden well or not ultra graphics gives of the advantage of being hidden at the same time making it hard for you to find your enemy and both side of course FPS vs Performance in your game Still Updating this review 
Nice game But  intelligence skill and luck wants Use your brain
CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH
This game sucks The server take too long to render and caused my PC to crash
Loooove this game they constantly update it Excited for future improvements
Fantasic Game that is quite hard to run Other than that great style
This isa reat game the graphics are beautiful and the mechanics are pretty good HOWEVER this game has more than a few issues most of them being micotransactions the developers streamers assuming everyone is stream snipping and the game has quite a few bugs but that s exected for an early access title that is still being worked on pretty regularly The reasons I listed aren t enough to not recommend this game
Good game Recommeded
fun game 1010 would play might not be worth 30 bucks but still a fun game
Good game
So basically this Game about killing other players kirito will probably hate thisI purchased this game about a week ago I even ask myself before I bought this game  I asked myself IS THIS WORTH IT  some people says Yes and others said Probablywell I still did Played for hours and told myself  I am not good at this game some bunch of racist players keep shouting at their mics and other players cries when they diewell heres for you guys  Press CTRLT before playing  and Shoot everything that moveshave a strategy and a mind set of a soldier as if you are the one whos in there and surviveThe game speaks for itself  Battleground  so basically its a battle royaleanother thing here a tips for you starters  Do solo to practice and get more BP or Squad to have a friend and a bloodyguard Shoot if you re sure about hitting the enemy Check surroundings USE THOSE BUSHES Crawl Press CTRL when approaching a house Press ALT to Free look if you re in a team or squad  DONT DRIVE LIKE A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   if you have 8x scope and use SMG dont be stupid and give the 8x scope to your friend who have sniper or AR or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HAVE A AR OF YOUR OWN COMMUNICATE  TALK use N W E S  North West East South for coordinates theres numbers in there use it Be vigilant Enjoy the game dont be an LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Sooo this is my review its up to you now my friendfor me its 910 and I were you purchase this game and start playing nowGood Luck
Too many Cheaters permanent ban please for cheaters
Great game Very addictive
Lovely Simply Lovely First of all i love the  Battle Royal  genre very much And i love PUBG so much that i bought it I dont buy games naturally this is my very first steam game The graphics addictive multiplayer experience and over all experience is amazingBetter than H1Z1 Fortninte and other  BAD games 90 out of 10 One thing i got that it has to be more stable and polished Other wise one of the best multiplayer game of all timeDont know why some people gave negative reviews Am happy with this game and the purchase And Steam please turn on Cash on Delivery properly so that lots of people will buy this and other great games from Steam Thanks
you can hit people with a pan and not get damage by shotguns while doing it
Great meme
The game speaks for itself when you can t start a match if you re not playing solo Worst game full of bugs Don t waste 30 USD on this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like me refund it
greeeat
Fun but laggy
do not buy anymoredeveloper is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE bugs and lag spikegame is trashand china no1 cheating
Fun gam
region lock until then im going to play fortnite
Easily the most frustrating buggy nerve wracking game i ve played in the last 3 yearsYet i can t help but start scratching at myself until i get my next hitY all got any more of them chicken dinners     fix the netcode and the odd physics glitches and this game will be a long lived leviathan
Love the game but needs to be optimized
It s better then all the other battle arena type games hehee xDDDDD
not poopie
nce
FPSShooter Gaming Industry you are welcome  This game was exactly what we needed to bring this genre back to life in the best way possible I can t really describe what this game has achieved or why you should buy it I can just say i am very glad and proud i bought it 3 days after its release If you are a fan of the FPS genre have been or just enjoy it now and then you should buy this game yesterday
Just honestly waiting for the offical release
awesome game 1010
Probably the best 2017 game so far
ONE OF THE MOST SOLD GAMES 2017 IF NOT THE MOST AND THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SERVERS ARE WORSE THEN UNTURENED SERVERS btw great game
The goods
1010 would play again
worst game ever why 1 mln ppl play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  wtf
What am I supposed to write here  It runs like Arma3 so you need a decent pc It s all down to luck really and there are things you can do to try and cut out some bad luck but it s all RnG That s ok This game can reduce grown men to giggling schoolgirls or raging steriod freaks in mere seconds It will take you to the depths of your depression and then the heights of adreneline fuelled chicken dinners The looting is as much fun as shooting The squad games are among the finest co op moments I have ever had in a game Frustrating exciting epic punishing hilarious confusing and above all addictive Furiously addictive If only I had friends that had the same stamina as I do This is the only game in my 260 library that doesn t make me mad and it really should at times I really like how fast you can get in to another match and I think that s why I just get in to the next match and forget it I recommend this gameFollow this page on fbook for amazing clips almost every day  https wwwfacebookcommrixolite
Amazing game Big fan of this game
I m going to be honest I love this game although it does have its ups and downs I have played quite a fair bit of this game and I will continue playing this for the following reasonsPros   Good understanding of battle royal  Good and balanced times for when the zone comes in  Decent gun play  You can customise your gun  Great balance of vehicles  Great updatesCons  Sometimes the gun play can feel gunky  The community is quite patient and the gameplay is slow  Some people are like shroud  The motorbikes can be so random  PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i is not Pokinky  Sometimes the loot can be VERY unbalancedOverall the game is a great game 810 would go to school again
Network Lag error F this sht
i got a kill
I never wrote 1 of these but ill right 1 for these trashbagsHow you going 2 say Fortnite copyed you when you tarts copyed H1Z1 and Arma Y all some butthurt LOVE LOVE LOVE  devs they upset you know you about 2 lose money 2 a Free gameSucks 2 SuckSo No I dont reccommend this game
Loot for 20 minutes before getting one shot ed by someone 400m away Wonky vehicle mechanics Watching team mates get slaughtered one by one Dropping to hotzone first only to find weapons have not loaded into game Dying to someone who dropped into hotzone later but guns were loaded for them Hours upon hours upon hours that I m never going to get back Would still do it all over again
TOP
Nice
Take AWM for me
Yessss
This game has issues It s biggest one being the actual devs themselves They clearly stated that there would not be microtransactions in this game before it got out of early access but they went back on that promise stating that they  wanted to test the microtransactions for the full release  Sure whatever you say BlueHole Also with this current controversy involving Fortnite s battle royale mode BlueHole has demonstrated a lack for professionalism that should not be accepted in this industry whether it is from an indie developer or a triple A one  and let s not forget the whole  stream sniping  thing that any negative review will mention All that said the game plays decently but is a technical mess with a serious lack of optimization I doubt BlueHole intends to ever polish their game because they are making money hand over foot without needing to I suggest staying away from this game for the time being I certainly wish I hadedit  So Pubg came out of early access and as of the time of writing this edit they have fixed almost none of the issues that were present in the game when it was in early access
very nice game  i love it
Free Banana Man
The idea of this game is good but poorly executed This game should be called race against the blue lineOnce in the map forget about looking for a stategic position and progressing forward at a reasonable rate just find a weapon ASAP then run from the blue lineWhen the blue line passes you you start dieing then you have to chase it and you will never catch up to it Hopefully you can get a vehicle  I die more times because of the blue line than from other players I get the reason for this game mechanic but it s way out of balance You don t need a gun in this game you need track shoes with booster rockets
Eh
A spectating button for the friends list while theyre in thier own server would be nice All around great game
THIS GAME IS AMAZING
pretty good
It is a good game
loving it now
Very good game super realistic and fun to play with friends 
Well where to startIt s a good game don t get me wrong but for the fame I think they need to improve it for the greater good I would love to play this game like I play any other game above 122fpsToo many glitches right now and some hackers here and there I would rate it 710 if they fix everything can go up to 85
1010 purely for the legendary frying pan
After the update the game has been optimizedThere are still some fps drops randomly but overall it s really good
Aiming is terrible ridiculess glitches and no fixes for many graphical issues They make an ridiculess amount of money from a thrash game that they price for 30 euro s Its a 10 euro game or even less Fun game if you dont mind bad mechanics and you want to have a fun game to play with 3 other people NO MORE than 3
loved it hope to destroy all cheater and hackers
AMAZING GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS PEOPLE JUST HATE ON IT COS ITS MAIN STREAM
It s a pretty good game Watch out for stream snipers
Before reading this be aware that I still play the game and love itThe game changed alot after they updated it and now I cant even say at a constant 50 FPS When the game was in early access I could walk through walls because I coul not generate textures fast enough they made it generate quicker and it worked very well but recently theres a bug where my FPS goes anywhere from 30 to 60 Also they made it so you could see your dethcam but they are so glitchy half the time they are invisble and the other times they have no sight on you
BGE
Very good gameplay and boy you can sell crates that you can buy with in game currency and the price is quite high that s always been a plus for me 3 months and you can earn some profits
Is very nice gaem pew pew Recommendeded
hit me nan after hitting a stanky baznaenae
it is 100  a game
Potenial   Very much so The battle royale game type shot this game up in popularity massively HOWEVER it NEEDS a teamdeath match or maybe even domination game type Battle royale simply isn t for everyone Added gamemodes will increase the games lifespan ALOT Don t think  Oh iits to popular to die off right now  Right now your eggs are all in one basket We the players need more of a reason to play A Example for what im trying to say is lets say im playing call of duty I Get bored of a gamemode well thats okay because theres a list of them for me to play So I can still enjoy the game but in different variations I Will say this If you want to try the game then try it Be part of its growth but also be vocal with your opinion The streamers can t make this game forever eventually our voices will be heard  I hope Once the game offers more for its demanding early access price tag I Will turn my thumbs to up untill then I have mixed feelings about its longevity which is concerning since theres so much untapped potential here Money is no longer a issue nearly 400M is alot of money for that small team Theres no reason this game shouldnt have a bright future
kitchen silverware does more damage than literal machine guns1010
Very fun gam really fun gam to play wit frends
This is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game only based on luck you could just play slots and you will also profit with slots not with this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
this game is pretty sick only problem is that sometimes the buildings don t load but always remember its still in beta
Everything is broken Hackers are everywhere Developers would rather add guns skins then fix the game
I love this game a ton Some people REALLY want to play this but can t I m glad I found a way toWith my late 2013 iMac I m able to play this game using Boot Camp   Windows 10 To get it to work smoothly I have to have game settings at 1280x720 fullscreen Windowed Everything on Very Low   I m averaging 21 24 FPS I know some people are over 60FPS   that would be epic but thats not happening on my iMac but I m still happy I can finally play without buying a gaming PCMy only Complaint is after the parachute flight all the buildings take 1 4 min for them to fully load  The Tab trick doesn t work for me probably because I m running into performance issues with Mac hardware Once the buildings load it runs great but before they do its nothing but glitching lagging   me trying to do my best and gear up in the shell of buildings   invisible obsticals then being screwed once everything loads At that point the energy feild usually takes me out before players do
An awfully designed game Yet somehow compelling Playing it is like eating a whole bowl of nails without any milk then going right back to the pantry for another
good play
game isn t that amazing  Its hunger games in army equipment and they will ban you for bugs Also dosen t preform well on older systems Community its on the internetdev team are toxic Its great mark on the history of gaming will be forcing players into a circle WOW how do did you ever come up with such a great idea only hundreds of storiesmovies over the last few centuries Worse 30 game i ve bought in years actually only bad 25 game i ve bought and i own hundreds Brother forced me into buying this trash I think people just think its skill based because you can 1 shot people that never see you It has same flaw as other realistic shooters You don t have shoot outs and show skill with your movement and aim Its a game of who sees who first Amazing shots in this game are long distance headshots on people behind rocks or in a window
Honestly I cant reccomend this game to anyone at this stage of develpment There are so many issues with this game that should have been fixed by now I understand that this game is a early access but these issues should have been fixed before the game even came out If I were to pick between PUBG and H1Z1 H1Z1 would get my vote as of right now I really want to like this game but there are too many small issues that push me away Also what is this whole thing with the streamers calling anyone who kills them a stream sniper  Like get a grip you got killed fairly Suck it up and dont go cry to the devs Save your 30 and use it on a better game where the devs dont side with all the crying streamers I am willing to change my review when things get better but it seems unlikely
An updated review I ve put a number of hours into this game now and the game in itself is still fantastic and a joy to play I ve played a number of hours and even have a soundboard set up so I can play music for other people leading to some quite funny situations in the game the main problem now is the hackers they re fighting against them but there s too many to hold back EU servers are full of nothing but Chinese players now who somehow manage to play on EU servers with good ping either way it s killing EU as the majority of Chinese players seem to be ones using hacks all I get in my games now are non stop instant snap on headshots or people snapping onto you through wallsThere are also frequent issues with the game bugs glitches galore are part of this game half the time it can t find servers to connect to not to mention the glitchy cars which send you flying at a slight touch the fall damage consistently f cks you over as you have to land PERFECTLY with your parachute in order not to take fall damage  Which is nigh impossible in a game with varying surface height on the groundHowever I won t let all this detract from the overall fun of the game this game is brilliant particularly with friends and you can do so many funny strategies in this game that really make it a roar of a time to play the feeling and the rush you get from getting a Chicken Dinner is really like nothing I ve ever played before in a gameOverall the gunplay the game the atmosphere the maps are all great but the game can t be played properly without a playerbase and the game is being ruined by the Chinese playerbase taking over EU and destroying their servers I would still recommend this game but buyer beware this game is full of hackers intent on ruining your gameplay You can still get a few good games in here and there but most of the time it s just Chinese instant lock on hacking pr cks who ruin everything for youGunplay  910General gameplay  710Playerbase  410Servers  410BugsIssues  10 meaning there are a lot 0 meaning none  710Variety  1010Fun  910Overall  710   Would recommend   the game whilst with issue can only get better from what it is now Hence why I m looking forward to the point that they get rid of these hacking c ntbags
I jump from the plane with this one guyWe landed on small place with few houseI pick up crowbar go inside the houseI hit the guy 3 4 timesHe go outside the houseI follow him Then I meet him face to faceHe run toward me jump and punch my head The guy killed you with headshot punch 1010 such  realism 
after 2 hours of being unable to fix the UI in the main menu i have decided to unistallDEV can t even fix the simplest thingmouse isnt in the correct placelocked in asia server because of stupid mouse uiPlay fortnite instead going to be F2P dosent have bugs like PUBG you can build your own buildings its just way better then pubg right now pubg is too buggy Pubg have bad optimazation 2 1080TI SC2 SLI  i7700k getting about 60 100 of fps in very low settings 1080p and dont even bother maxing out the settings or going 4k resoultion when u have a 8x scope and zoom in it drops heavy i went down all the way to 30fpsso yeah just go play Fortnite their battle royal is 1010 better i rate it 310and would not reccomend to a friend
Overhyped poorly optimised garbage Early access games with microtransactions are a joke only to be topped by the developers Yes I am mad
I like Chicken and this game let s me have as many chicken dinners as I want 1010 Chicken Dinner
Great game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  them streamers asking for money They can eat a boner LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  straight up
Great game for being in early access personally I think its the best in its genre
Must have is easy game
This is such a good game I strongly recomend it
This game is worthless Their mobile version is much better The audio in this game is trash I can never tell where the bullets are coming from  There should be an on screen indicator When you get shot in real life you know the general direction of where the bullet came from
Too many glitches hackers specially CHINAs and no training mode
jebac doktora
this game is scam
A very nice game
AWESOME 
This game is such a fun game to play It had action but also strat gameplay I recommand this game  y
This is a fun game Even though I get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  a lot It is highly enjoyable and a nice change in game for me
You d have to not have a brain to find this game fun
Even though this game is in early access and still has some bugs I am enjoying it a lot My biggest problem is that I have to have most of the graphics on low with only a couple set at medium And the game is much better with a friend to play duo withI have not played squads yetI love the scavenging aspect along with the ever shrinking safe zoneMy rating 45
The Shizzle   Enough said
THIS GAME IS THE BEST HILLBILLY DELUX MADNESS EVER THAT HAS EXSISTED IN ALL EXSISTENCE GAD IS GREAT BEERR IS GOOD AND PUBG IS AMAZING BY THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME RIGHT NOW DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT JUST DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IT ITAS AMAZING IF YOU AINT FIRST TO BUY IT YOUR BADAND LAST
very fun gamelots of enjoyable tims to be had with friends would recomend to anyone who is cool and not gay
Decently challenging verying gameplay A little buggy but other than that petty well done and fun Great replayability and fun with friends 810
The only problem with this game is that you can get punched twice and die
Game is fun Got shot with a shotgun through a 4 inch thick wall 1010 would die again
Bluehole called out Fornite for creating their own Battle Royal mode Pot calling the kettle black they did the same exact thing they arent the first Fornite is free and hands down better in everyway RIP PUBG was nice to know you Will no longer support trash developers with unoptimized games and no new features
You dont own an entire game genre folks  Maybe ID should have sued everyone who made an FPS after doom 
Solid game with good gameplayHowever instead of optimizing it developers are adding useless features 30  Chance of crashing and 3 4mins to load buildings Don t have an SSD   1080ti  Get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed then   Bluehole 2017
I bought this game pretty recently after early access had come out i simply wanted a battle royale i could play with my friends it has since grown my love and hate for these type of games exponentially I only say hate out of greed of not getting first every game hahaha so dont let that misguide you Even though it can be repitive in certain aspects i highly reccomend it because every game can provide with a different experience and players from the last try The crates are a nice added bonus as well
Honestly when you get by the fact that this game is barley Optimized it s alot of Fun I do recommened it simple because I can forgive it since it s still in Early access it s got lots to come and Hopefully the Optimization get s better
Stupid game with a lot of cheaters Same like valve useless developers
Boring
swag game
what a lovely steaming pile of crap
its a little rough around the edges but what more can you expect from early access Its a run game wehter your playing with friends or by yourself
Fun game Hard to get used to but still fun Gone an entire game without firing my weapon and still had a good time
Hackers already WOW
This game is fun I stopped playing csgo after getting this game I m currently waiting for optimization I have a Ryzen 7 1700  30ghz  will OC soon and gtx 1080ti gaming x 11gb  with 16gb ddr4 2400 ram getting 40 80 fps on lowmedium settings gg
This is a very fun game considering it is still in beta a definate must buy
g
 Jump out a plane naked Land in a strange Romanian Town Kill a guy with a pan Go home and play PUBG57 would purchase again
cantik menarik tertarik kau memang dabomb
If you like a slow but fast battle royale where you have to think before engaging this is the game for youif you only like fast paced game go the worse h1
Awesome Game Recomend To Every One
bagus gamenya bikin ketagihan lupa waktu mandi dan makan
wkwkwkwkwk
Awful lag can t even load in and start a match without Play Doh textured buildings and given the off chance I m able to clip through one of the walls I still can t do anything because the game will freeze  allowing one of the 100 players who have parachuted down with me to put a shotgun shell inside the side of my dome Running on a 960 intel i5 4460 with 8gb ram on an HDD I doubt that my specs are the problem though because I m playing on LOWEST SETTINGS I never refund games but if I don t here I d actually be setting 30 on fire
The dev of this game is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  cun7 Also needs to be front kicked thorugh many many many glass doors
PUBG has so many Hackers  and that means nobody wins besides Hackers PUBG is garbage Because anywere you go like school  apartments and PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i  YOU DIE so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pubg
beri gut gem
Better than fortnite x10
I ve since changed my opinion on this product There are still glaring flaws with the community  being loaded with cheaters but the problem doesn t seem as bad  The only things I can say suck about this game is how objects that would IRL be shot through easily could absorb an entire shotgun shells load or a dozen bullets  protecting the other individual being that i ve had a few cases where this was the issue Other than that I think with friends this can be a blast
Most of the time it s great
The best battle royale game EVER  Developers are active and the game is constantly being updated with new features which make the gameplay more awesome each time a patch is released   Must buy if you are looking for an awesome FPS game  D  You won t be disappointed after buying this game I bet     
sick game Thats all i can say
im love BATTLEGROUNDS
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game 10 year old graphic dull gameplay enjoy
Becuase of the amount of hackers in this game it is basically who can out hack each other Given most of these hackers suck and anyone with any kind of computer skills can probably kill most of them But in the end too many hackers So dont even bother buying this game anymore
ESports ready game Haha Suck my balls A gaYme based on luck is never gonna be a sport Buting new guns and skins in is not gonna improve the game In a few months its gonna be the same crap like H1Z1 But H1Z1 is performing outstanding against this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game May I gonna change my opinion if its released and this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is improved but right now don t buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it s gonna hurt your stomach ESports should stay skill based Please keep that in mindPros without a gun will not win against an amateur with a gunEven on servers which u should have a nice ping u are getting shot after peeking behind wallsE Sports READYImagine this happens in CS GO GARBAGE______________________________________edit Nov 2017DESYNC is part of this game Don t get mad just laugh about the dev team                                            EDIT  Jan 2018After the game was released there were even more lags and server desync noticeableCrashing client nearly every second game was also part of this TOPSELLERPING would be lovely for an MMO PVE based game but for an PVP FPS game is still horribleU LIKE GETTING SHOT AFTER STRAFING BEHIND A COVER U WILL LOVE THIS GAME The DEV Team is never gonna get this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  working properly so u should not buy itIF I WOULD BE ABLE TO REFUND THE GAME AFTER THE RELEASE I WOULD GO FOR THATClearly not worth buying________________________________________edit Feb 2018Hackers took over blueholeRegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina RegionLockChina________________________________________edit  March 2018Last Update was pretty Good Performance is ok There s one big issue still Hacker all overFix this pls
More weapon will be best
Server updates rolled out far too frequently  with associated downtime for all
Best Game
Game of the yearA different gaming style inspiring a real adrenalin rushCan t wait for full release
I think that this is the best game there is on steam It will never stop growing it will always ne the best there is
It s an average game with average graphics Cool concept but I don t get the hype Way too expensive for early accessEdit  Out of early access and still sucks
Its like H1Z1 but you actually have FUN
I feel like I was in Kenya I found Akm before I found a drink
 joins game  mutes voicechat because screaming kids  drops at 2 houses  finds pistol  gets to circle  crosses field  gets shot  dies  repeats 1010 would cross a field to get shot again
Extremely buggy You can t play it
A great game to play with friends Seriously or just for funits a blast
This game is not recommended Since buying this game the server often has problems from the beginning to now it was counted the server crashed a total of 154 times and no matter how to maintain the collapse Think about it one has been in steam while the number of online beyond Dota popular games the gains even enough to maintain the server stability it can let a person dare not believe even as a game is perfect but the server has been affecting each game player collapse game experience are undoubtedly disappointing
The game is good and fun however the game is not very well optimsed and even my rx 480 struggles to run it Also its much more fun with friends and wouldnt rely on randomers as they dont listen and are so god damn LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Finally when buying this game be ready to be killed alot by campers as this game is quite a camping simulator where people would just wait for you to make the move or noise
Thought this game would be an improvement of DayZ  H1Z1  Rust combined but Battle RoyaleThing is its REALLY unplayable when it comes to playing the game with a sucky suck specs The only way to play this smoothly is by buyin the GTX Nvidia Series no integrated graphics nothingI m having 1 FPS average on this game too but who s to blame since I couldn t upgrade my piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  laptop I m gonna be stuck on having an i3 5010U Intel 5500 HD Graphics Card 6 GB DDR3 RAM forever lolIf you have better specs I recommend you buying this game If not then don t cuz you re only gonna waste your mons for nothing but disappointment Read the Minimum Specs first too to see if it can run This is where I ve learnt my lesson cuz I forgot to read dem specs SmhTL DR   Don t buy this game if you have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  specs because this game is unoptimized and its barely playable that are below minimum recommended specs
its cool but too lag
Finally a game of the Battle Royal concept that is genuinely good Everything just feels really polished smooth and well balanced  for an early access online multiplayer game The developers actually seem to listen to the community and act upon request therefrom Very few bugs andor glitches and a great balance of anything from spawnrates and itemstats to gamepace  through stuff like the decreasing size of playarea and general size of map in relation to the amount of players and time to get into a new gameIt s satisfying and exciting without ever getting tedeous and only occasionally a bit frustrating   but that s only because I m fairly competitive in games likes these and getting 2 can induce a slight form of frustration eventhough it is only due to my own competences   or rather lack thereofThe only major thing I feel like this game needs is better optimization and I feel like that is definitely something that will be addressed in future updates as it is still in early access I have a 1080ti with a similar level to the rest of my PC specs so I run it on Ultra graphics with an absolute minimum of 60fps however I rarely reach over 100 and feel like that should be the case for a game like this in 2017  granted the stuff I mentioned above  I am fully aware of the game still being in early access and just mention this in case people are wondering if they should get it within the near futureAlso the price is less than half of AAA titles which I feel is more than reasonable Considering the fact that you have come here and read so far into a random review of the game I recommend you try it out for a match or two and if you don t like it you can always return it within 2 hours   via Steam for a full refund9510 from me
The best Day Z like on the market Runs well if you have a decent PC and worth hours of fun
very gooooooooooooooood gammmeeeeeee
I have been really enjoying the game With the latest patches the game has been running smoother and smoother Will be enjoying this game for a while

wtf i bought this so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing expensive and suddenly i cant play wtf is wrong with this game
I would 100  recommend this game as it s extremely fun to play  If you have a group of friends to play with it makes it even betterI like the direciton the game is going  except the key and crate system that requires use of real money and I m excited for the new maps mod support and vaulting  I love FPP and I love the strategic squad combat that this game enables  All in all I would definitely recommend this game to anyone considering buying itThank you Bluehole and PLAYERUNKNOWN for this great game
Very nice gameReally intense and makes your heart skip a beat sometimes
Regarding the game plug in the company should be judged according to the abnormal data           But the high data does not mean that the data is abnormal Do not mistake it            This game is still a half finished product in my eyes Please fill in the Bluehole and don t be satisfied with the result now      I would like to make a few suggestions            1 when helmets and armor are not equipped on the ground they can be damaged 2 when the remaining 5 players in the final circle are less or less only close arms and fist are allowed           The use of close combat weapons can be improved            Improve the purchase demand of the near war weapon skin          To  Improve the fun of the game
Better than H1Z1 but still has a lot that is broken  Often with top armor and top helmet you can still get one shot killed by a mid grade rifle
Too much RNG based Gets boring and repetitive after a few days It has microtransactions even though devs said they won t add themand it s just in early access And sucking up to streamers
Dont know what to say I hate this game yet i play it
update 5gb every week
yes This is the game I paid 30 not the buggy unoptimized mess that it was before 10 was defiently a step in the right direction Well worth it now
I want to love this game but its terrible They ruined it
Although there is unfortunately not more content yet this game makes a lot of fun and grants you a lot of funny hours The solo gamemode doesn t make sense because this game is lot more fun with friends New updates and more content in the future can make this game even more amazing and surprising It is not finished yet and that is obvious Better to wait a bit to enjoy more stuff and better bug fixes All in all not a perfect game but it makes a lot of fun Especially with friends
Love this Game  The yre adding new maps and a parkour system which is gonna be sweet hopefully  3
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
if you like getting beaned from across the map this game is for you

Great game active devs keeping it fresh Reshade is a huuuge plus on it though
Awesome Game
Cool game
I know it says I barely played it but still  I watched tone of videos of it m played it at my friends place couple of times  bought it and realized i made a mistake I know this is early accsess bu still gonna point out the problems with the game Gameplay is pretty much same as H1Z1 just with few diffrences Energy field thing that slowly kills you is only fun thing in this game Full of toxic people  in like less than a minute  there were 6 kids and adults arguing in russian or something  it was hard to tell cause they were all speaking at the same time  yes they can be easly muted  but just shows its a really toxic community  Overrated game honestly  30 euros is too much for this  I d say about 20 is enoughMeh  they should add meh as an option instead of just recommended and not recommendedThis has nothing to do with me being a CS GO player  cause I see   only CS GO players woud hate this cause it overpassed CS GO   It did but that dosen t mean anything to me honestly  I just don t like it at it s current stateI refunded to buy something classic  but thats not really immportantOverall  this is overrated basic survival game atm  hopefully they will add more and make it better in future You should buy it when it s on sale Also please don t go toxic over my opinion on this game
nice work team the cheater never come again
A good sample of HIGH TEC vedio game Only scientists and rich LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s can survive this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Skidaddle skidoodle hacker s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is now a noodle
Gamenya seru  Tapi CHINA NUMBA WANCHINA NUMBA WANCHINA NUMBA WANOH LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    Ketemu orang bisa bahasa inggris seneng banget gw
This Game is awesome Instant classic
Don t buy passive players only
First off LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game I ve had so many problems with the voice chat system loading screens frequent crashes lag connecting to friends and fps  my computer can play pretty much anything on ultra but this isnt optimised very wellSecondly the core gameplay is great and that is why the game has grown so much but with all the issues it frustrates me to the point of never wanting to play the game until its fixed As much as the developers are a small team they have enough money to hire new peopleThus i would not reccommend getting the game until the game is fixed or is at a point where it is playable without making you frustrated because of things you cant control
VERY NIVE GAME
this game is nice and spicy like most game that i buy the difference betwwenn this gmae and otehers lik ti si thet it is a shart your pants game i was driveing a booge and then gop shot and i sharted my pants and quite a large bulge stuk oot of my whtie pants it was the lowest point in me life i could not belive tis happened and the poo oozed out of my pant in to ply 12 dooler gaming chair i cried th at night i hop you no y11 1010 IGN
Dont buy atleast 50 60 ppl afk every round  but hey atleast they added a new gunEDIT  Atleast they fixed the AFK problem  Now you just crash every game cancer game
Wait a secondI thought that PUBG was located on Mars Never knew that you need 10 hours to land back on the ground when you jump
Very good game makes me wet
Terribly broken since launch Although they fixed  some  things the bugs and glitches that are left in are still extremely bad That barely scratches the surface Filled with hackers and chinese players that ruin the game furtherInstead of fixing the main issues they just pump out crates and skins  even though they said there was gonna be no microtransactionsThey add maps without even fixing the optimizationIt s like they stopped caring about the game itself and only care about milking the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of it nowMobile version probably runs better than the PC version
Nothing like getting banned for  stream sniping  when you don t know that someone is streaming
Exciting
its a amazing game better than h1
Good game Cant wait for it to be fully developed
Game is nice and all but its not optimized and it doesn t have indicators of where you re getting shot from so it looks like I m getting shot from the international space station
fix your game way too mamny bugs you are spending too much time making new maps and making new weather and not enough time allowing me to rejoin my games nad when i do get an option to rejoin uit says  connection lost  FIX IT I PAYED MONEY TO PLAY THIS GAME AND I ENJOY IT WHEN IT ISNT BREAKING
I recommend this game for those who wants to enjoy a strategic action game
pan is life
love it Better than H1Z1 KOTK
So far I m really bad at this game    first day playing itThis is by far the most fun ive had playing a game This gets my full support looking forward to more content
Love the game but it really needs to be better optimized
Great game I liked playing this game with friends and it s really fun I would recommend getting this game Since this game is still in early access there is going to be bugs here and there but it well eventually be fixed
Its okay fun to play still some issue with lags but hey we get there some day hopefully
best game  P
positive
good fun game but bugs suck but worth the oney
honestly so fed up with this game seems like they wont ever fix key issues but continue to release new minor updates to attract more sales
great game takes a little getting used to if you have trouble running it put this in the launch options    USEALLAVAILABLECORES  mallocsystem
Better than Lawbreakers
It s the best option if you prefer  realistic  Battle Royale games
It s okay but would enjoy a feature of where you are placed in games with people your skill level For example being placed in a squad with people who are playing the game for the first time isn t the best experience Takes a while to go from game to game would like a way for that to be faster and also a way to train would be nice instead of going through 50 games PVP having learned very little
up
Would Recommend 1010 IGN
Too good and its still on beta Worth the price Less kids less toxic I guess
Best game in the world
gg
frame drops at the worst times Need a 5k PC just to compete with the other low skill players 
this game is good
Personally I find this game sort of boring  7 hours and I feel like I have to make myself play it I got it because it s wildly popular and I design games myself so maybe I m not strictly the target audience but let me elaborateSo I hear a lot of people turned off by the game because it s a shooter When I first picked up the game and was impressed to be in the top 50  I thought that maybe that wasn t true because you can make it pretty far through wits and strategyHere s the thing though The game literally monentarily reward killing people and you are only going to get that credit if you shoot someone There is no other way to outplay someone Sure you can have the highground better items and even a car but to take someone out you are going to have to kill them and that almost always means playing the game like a first person shooterNow personally I think shooters are sort of a played out genre I really enjoy the early stages of the game where you plan out your route try to get as much loot while taking as few risks as possible but the map shrinks That means that no matter how successfully you outmanuvered others in the early stage of the game winning means that you are going to end up in a tiny circle in a firefight To me that sounds more like losing because it s the part of the game I least enjoyI think that the survival elements of this game the circle contracting the design of the map and even the way items spawn are excellent and interesting but to conclude I just don t enjoy the actual gameplay when it gets to what the game is really about

Good game fun to play with Friends  BEWARE OF STREAMERS Has Bullet Drop which is Nice My Pc Can t even Run this game I bought it and play it on a Com shop or net caffe what ever you freaking call it in your Country Mineski has strong pc s so I Play It ThereI need A Better RigCON  Streamers are very whinny and childish they will get you banned for killing them so yeah your money can get wasted if the developers keep banning people just because someone said so or because someone is streaming Dear Devs I Don t even know if you are reading this But Please Don t just banne People We have BattlEye Can t you use that  I mean It s kinda scary to Play the game Knowing you Can Get Banned for Killing Another Player
I used to like this laggy piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  until something came out called Fortnite Fortnite is so much more superior to this game because they update all the time have fun features in the game fun gamemodes cross platform more fps more players better developers RIP Chinese Royale
Fix your game where you don t have to do Updates 4 times a week  pubg 
If you are looking for a quality game that has good servers good loading times almost no gamebreaking bugs at a somewhat managable use of resources I would recommend H1Z1 King of the KillAlso don t try to play this game with more than 30 ping You will conistenlty teleport out of cover get stuck in one place witness other players sliding around and completely freeze
never thought a game in alpha could be ruinned by an update but i guess this is what happens when you would rather sell more copies than make a propper game and rush LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out It was a no before but its an even bigger no now i might uninstall if they continue to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  their players around
just a sick cruel Joke
great games need a little more polish A MUST  1st person for Latin America
garbo
this game is actually one of the better games in this category recomended  
Bought this game out of boredom played two rounds continued to be bored Can tell it s one of those games that s just the same ol sht over and over Not sure what I was expecting just kinda wish I could get my 37 back
Too much for my pc
Asking for a refund already due to the graphics this game requires to run I ve got an Alienware laptop never buy from this make there LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and overpriced but I cannot run this game so am requesting a refund the cheeky LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  from Steam even have the audacity to tax me on a refund LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you Gabe you four eyed LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Thanks ManLykeBSimms
I m tired of this game seriously Buggy slow on good pcs and crowded with hackers In game report system that doesn t work no server replay system  the devs want us to record with third party  software a hacker instead of making a system like CSGO overwatch and updates that is focused on content instead of problem solving  like the ever lasting and buggy loading map issueD O  N O T  B U Y  I T   D O  N O T  B U Y  I T   D O  N O T  B U Y  I T   
WHY    WHEN I WANT TO PLAY IT AND LOGING IN IT ALWAYS SAID  SERVER ARE TOO BUSY RETURN MY MONEY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Banned for no stated reason after almost 700 hours played 1010  _  
it sucked it just did im sorry but dont buy it

This is the most well made bug free game i have ever experienced Very realistic graphics and gameplay but don t try and play it in 4k or it will break your monitor from the number of screen tearing and resolution stutter The game is very balanced I once shot a kid with no helmet 4 times in the head with a sniper rifle and he did not die as you would expect the kid ended up dying to a pistol from 300m away in about 3 4 shots minutes later You just can t find any other game with that kind of realism The sounds in the game are like no other as u can be getting shot from the east but hear it in the west just as u would if u were being shot at in real life Sometimes when you re running you can hear the sound of a buggy constantly ringing in your ear as if u are about to take a tire up the LOVE LOVE LOVE  but then u turn around and realize it was of a buggy 2000m away on a hill The game truly begins to reach its full potential once u get on a raining server The game intensifies by 10x due to the fact that u can t hear footsteps vehicles airdrops or gunshots Just the ever so present sound of rain and wind LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing your ear drums The game has 2 main servers NA and Asia If u want a real challenge asian servers are key Your ping lowers by about 85  and you won t understand anything anyone is saying in the pregame chat which i find to personally be the best part of the game If a bunch of chinese noodle slurpers hyped up on soy sauce playing a highly competitive battle royale game in 15 fps doesn t scare you i m not sure what willThe game can be very slow to start but makes sure to pick up the pace rapidly as u are constantly being chased by a giant blue electric field readying to bend u over and closing u into a smaller zone of players In most cases you ll only have a UMP and if ur lucky a crossbow going up against three M249s and a korean kid with an AWM ghillie suit and a 200 mouse Seems like a bad situation right  wrong The crossbow shoots a bolt that does more damage than the 50 magnum rounds shot from the awp Not to mention it s completely silent Most developers would make airdrop items valuable and most powerful but PUBG has found a creative way to make the UMP the best gun in the game and spawn it in 2 rooms of every house making for a very balanced multiplayer experienced     As its in early access you d expect some bugs and glitches right  wrong again PUBG is the only game i have ever played to not contain any bugs or glitches PUBG can guarantee you that you will never spawn in without the vision of buildings and structures or fall through the floor on a rainy but NOT LAGGY server Once i was climbing a 1000m 90 degree sea cliff in the middle of a thunderstorm as the game allows and i reached the top only to get stuck on one tree and a rock in a field and instantly die to falling damage while having two ARs an AR suppressor and a SR suppressor After raging for what i thought was a bug i found on the PUBG forum that it was not a bug but a fundamental part of the game This was implemented because in real life when u jump on a rock next to a tree u have the possibility of falling off the rock into the tree and splitting your head open This game effect is rare but triples its chances in rain As you can tell the game is very optimized and well past its time compared to other FP shooters A game filled with looting gunfights parachutes diversely cultured pregame lobbies but never swimming After my long and fun filled experience with PUBG i feel it is my job to you to recommend this game to any and all fellow steamers It will be the best 30 youve ever and will ever spend Unless u play 3rd personThis review is not sponsored by PUBG or Nike
Game is trash have to restart after every game laggs a lot isnt optimized Just save yourself the money and time and go play block n load Highly recommended
It is basically like h1z1 but better way betterUPDATE  urggggggg this game is so inconsistent hit someone 5 times nothing get shot with 1 bullet from a vss dead it is an incredibly annoying aspect of the game that requires some fixing till its fixed its unplayable given the fact that a kill depends on sheer luckEdit  cheaters cheaters CHEATERS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chinese hackers everywhere I swear if i get once more sniped away within a second  i mean me and my whole squad i swear  i get Columbine feelings LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ASIANS

EARLY ACCESS The best worst game ever Poorly optimised and frequent bugs Definitely needs a few gameplay tweaks  as to be expected with an early access Despite all this can t stop playing it incredibly addictive and a serious thrill towards the end game PATCH 10 Unplayable hackers every single game Dont buy until they fix it but i doubt they ever will
Well u guys now LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up my game with this new update I was doing just f9 with 20 fps in low graphcis  It was quite playable but now  the game is more unoptimized with fluctuation of fps with more shutteringThe new update says its more playable for low end pc but i say u made less playable for low end pc
For nearly 1200 hoursThe best part is that when you first come into contact with this game it s fun to look around for weapons and equipmentSince the rise of some exilesPlayers are more likely to cheat to win the gameAnd it s growingCompared to competitive games like lolThe growth and continuity of the game is not guaranteedAnd the authorities are not sincere about itSome game anchors use software that identifies cheating players But the authorities are just trying to add new tricks to their livesSo it s not a technology that hasn t responded It has to be thought of as some sort of benefit to cheater software companies and authoritiesOf course it s just personal speculationIn my mindIn less than a year PUBG has begun to declineBut lol has been playing for eight yearsNot that it s good or bad of course but it s a good way to get a better sense of what s going on as a video game player
I don t get the whole region lock China thing Never played against any Chinese people never been killed by a hacker Excellent experience with friends I can t reccomend it enough  
This game has a huge player base and also they were able to make a ton of money a guess what Still filled with bugs and they focus on releasing crates and more content instead of fixing their gameOn top of that issues with servers and they released a crate that contains LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  worthless skins not recommended
This game is ruining my adult life All responsibilities have been neglected Couldn t ask for more well done
Amazing game I love this
just wait for its release
This game is gonna be exactly like H1Z1 they will have tourments for days and take 3 years to actually release a game Like why release a finished game when you can release a game in beta and never fix anything SO many things are wrong with this game and i don t know where to start so I won t Not worth my time Don t buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Go play King of the Kill or The culling which are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but better than this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Love Simpleton
 WHERE THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  AM I BEING SHOT FROM

It s basically DayZ or ArmaDayZ without the zombies Exact same game mechanics and controls Graphics are very similar It s different in game duration where pubg is roundmatch based and dayz is a continuous world in most cases It s unfinished but not sure how much more they re going to add minus more weapons vehicles  helicopters It s cool diving out of the air though Personally makes me worry about our post apocalyptic future Just reviewing to get the badge
Best loot simulator I ve ever played Pretty certain the servers are just a bunch of baked potatos plugged in series tho
Great game no doubt It s something we competitive players have been waiting for a long time However this game with some optimization it ll be a killer game  it ll soon be launched for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One With this said graphics and stability will be 100 
30 worth of something  Good Job Devs 
great 
Amaazingly beautiful great game worth the money
This game is the best game ive ever played and its very cool and goodi think when its not going to be early acces its going to be even better Recomend this game signed by Raziken
I ve played it quite a bit I rarely enjoy it As a concept it s a great game but the execution is woeful And since they made it a farmable game where crate contents could be sold for real  on the Steam Market cheating has gone through the roof Like all addictions it s unrewarding shallow lacks depth and yet gives just enough of a buzz to keep you coming back thinking it s worth another hitSo 10 is released Vaulting etc is good Game is less laggy Rubberbanding fixed mostly All goodSadly the game is infested with cheating Check out the Steam forums check out the PUBG forums story s the same Chinese cheats farming the BP The game needs ping caps and region lock and it needs them urgently Brendan can whine all he wants but that s what the game needs It also STILL needs a better anti cheat BattleEye is woeful as any client side AC is going to be In short don t buy this game You ll get hooked it will be an ultimately unrewarding experience and you ll end up infuriated and exasperated in roughly equal measuresThe developers truly do not care about your experienceIt might become a slick and playable title one day but by then someone with standards and programming skill will have probably done it better
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cancer Don t buy it if you want to be healthy and cancer free Holding W simulator is a piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game that isn t worth your time and effort
Honestly so fun to play Played for 13 hours and see why people say this is better than H1Z1 If it was a bit quicker paced and people stop phroning so much it d be better xd All around though perfect game  Especially if you like H1 and Arma 3
just waw
enjoyable when you start the game at the first time after hours ago u wll understand how wasted your money
Pros   You can kill with a pancons   You can be killed with a panExcepting the case of the graphics optimization this game is already  early access a f      blast
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  why do you keep saying grown the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up  I am grown unlike you I work i game i get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i have friends but i certainly dont have people carrying me and i didnt write a paragraph about your stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE  I m making a point I have 21k hours because i actually try by myself and i ve been playing for a several years But whatever this is my last comment Dont respond no more
I love this game A keep me playing all night long so cool and sometimes you found guys more crazy than you lmao
Lots that needs a touch up in this game but it s fun regardless
There s more Chinese players on the US server than there are americansthey don t speak english and when they do they can only say  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE a uuuuu   stupid americans  and my favorite  China numba waaaaaannnnnn also they re horribly racist and ever time i try to play squads it s either all asians or half american and half chinese it s annoying when communication is key and you can t communicate with your team mates and the asians are almost always in Lan Cafe s and you hear nothing out of their mic other than the loud LOVE LOVE LOVE  background noise other than that it s an amazing game with a ton of potentialBut the bad part is the game is not optimised although the game is still early access but i have a low framerate with a Ryzen 7 1700 and a GTX 1060 6gb Please fix this soon
i am going to keep it short The game is GREAT when it works properly  beware 248 mb patches roflmaoMy advice on how to play this tough 1Play PUBG2Be great at it3Get lots and lots of BP4Buy lots and lots of cases each week with earned BP5Sell those cases with useless clothesweapon skins inside to peasants who buy them on the market and make profit6Buy other gamesskins for other games that you play and love7PROFIT
Just a good Battle Royale game that need some sound animations server improvements
Very addictive and perfect game for play with friendsAfter the 10 out  Instead of fixing their ping issues they added desert mapand buggy 10fps xbox version which noone asked for it and i am pretty sure most of the player base doesnt even like new map But game forcing you play desert map You cant choose what map you wana play and getting old map ise lower that  50 percent for some reason why  Game ping issues is lot worse than before new map come out and some reason desert map is lot more laggy from old map By laggy i mean you keep teleporting arround like since game start to 10 20 minOnly good thing about 10 is the fps fix they did a great job on that but again ping issues was first rate problem not fps
89 hours of 90 hours total play time has been spent looting The other hour is hiding behind trees1010 would recommend to friends and family
LOL All these banned players by streamers OMG to funny Dev s should never make the game so easy to cheat and still they are raking in all your money OMG I can t stop laughing about it You cheaters got caught LMFAO Thats why I only play with multiplayer games that keep cheaters out
Addictive and fun to play with friends
One of the best games I ve playedminor bugs but its okWorth it 910
hit A game i don t know why i keep playing it it has long wait time between lobbies low loot drop rate in high risk high reward areas and pusies everywhere
always dc while in game  why  Battleye wtf is that 
REGION LOCK CHINA
I ll use my first standings in solo matchmaking 99100
Streamer fadSounds are off when someone walking upstairs it s like you are being bombarded but you have to mind that fly buzzing because it is not a fly it is a motorcycle zooming to you insteadAlso game map does not load like conventional modern games whole world tries to load simultaniously not as you wander If you don t have a SSD or min 16 Gigs of RAM  stay away Other than that it bad old h1z1
Good game Shame about the amount of teaming people do in solo s though If they stopped mic being available to use in solo s this would happen lessIt s slowing killing the fun and wanting of playing it in Solo s Yes you can report them but with the amout of people playing it s always going to happen regardless
Winning 1 out of 100 Has never felt so good
best game evar
I dont believe for a second that all of you were perfect little angels that dindu the stream sniping you were accused of
It not bad game It nice
LOW FPS
Great game lots of fun with friends the more you play the better you get and the more you get addicted
 OCE isn t high enough population for FPP Servers

I hate this game so much
This game is very enjoyable especially when played with friends and offers an intense competitive atmosphere I love playing and the only complaint I have is it not having multiple maps While the current one is huge and very fun to play on I think a new map would add a special twist I reccomend this game to anyone who loves FPS games if you are getting into them though it may be difficult for you but it s always difficult and that s great
First match  I hide in a bathroom to test graphical settings and key bindingsI finish 5th cause a blue thing showed upI saw nobody but I felt like a true pacifist survivorGood game to follow the pacifist path  and die after1110PS  A white flag is a need in this game
Very cool game it contains a lot of tactical action and firefight It can make you addict  It s like h1z1 but in a different way it s much cooler in my opinion If you have money for it you should definitely try it
Everyone is sooo LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Hyped and talking bout skill and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  while this game is 80  LUCK No aim required no Skill required Player just hopping around like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bunnys to avoid bullets  most of the  Streamer  do this as well and people camp way too much which destroys the game  yes yes yes its part of the game blahblabblah 3rd Person ist the most idiotic modus but ofc you can call yourself  skilled  Yes ofc   peeking without actually moving means you are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing skilled The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t is real
Best game for this kind of generation
WHY DID I BUY THIS WHY 
this AF6l l3bh xD
Dev s say OCE won t be getting FFP server cause population is too low in OCE servers I haven t played in OCE servers since the release of FFP and neither has every person that I know that owns the game as TTP is trash and FFP is 1000x better The guys at Blueballs can cent more of our money The same thing goes for players in SEA and SA DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE IN OCEANIA SOUTH AMERICA OR SOUTH EAST ASIA THE DEVS DON T GIVE A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ABOUT US
Coming from someone who plays fps games like call of duty battlefield overwatch and some RPG s In my opinion very boring Its too slow paced The first 30 seconds is the most fun I only played three matches but i didnt like it like at all I started thinking about studying during playtime If you like slower games that require grinding you might like it But I dont Also i heard it has an issue with banning so if you do want it i d wait a month
very fun game needs more game modes especially a aim map so you can practice shooting
Unfinished piece of crap with shitty serwers and full of cheaters
Very fun game but only campers
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing class mus
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
If you put aside the glitches and bugs  mostly with cars this game is overall pretty fun When playing solo mode it can be agrivating at times but in multiplayer mode It is almost a whole different game With squads all you do is find creative ways to shoot eachother and blow upglitch cars 910  60 hours and I haven t even won yet
Yes honie yes
The best and most addicting game ever
works like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and the devs are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
SITY game for full price
Just buy it
nevermind LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
Fun but super frustrating Wait until it s much more refined
I ve played the game from Early Access to Release and even past thatI ve come to dislike the game and I would not recommend it in it s current stateI m going to explain my dislikes about the game in a couple different subjectsBugs  I really enjoyed PUBG in Early Access and didn t mind the bugs and bad performance that came with it because it was in Early Access I could accept it and enjoy the game for what it is But as it s come to about four months after it s 10 Release and the game still freezes occasionally near the start of the game and lags even with most all of the settings on low This can kill you and it has killed me numerous times trying to get a gun and fight in hot drop locations This is not the only bug that I ve encountered as there are a couple more I can name with more that I couldn t possibly name in this review otherwise the entire thing would be in this bugs section There was a bug on the stairs in the Miramar map where you could vault through the wall and kill players from said wall This wasn t patched for at least a week or two and was abused like hell I and many other players also get frequent game crashes from  bad_module_info  and while I ve heard this is an issue with a Windows 10 update this is the only game I experience it on and Bluehole never decided to care or even try to fix this bug TL DR The game is still buggy even after 10 release and the Devs would rather rake in that sweet sweet dough with Weapon Skins than fix these bugs and improve the performance of the game It still runs awful even after everything  If you want an idea of my computer specs  I run R6  Siege on Ultra settings at 60 FPSGuns and Gunfights  I m honestly not even sure where to begin with this The gunplay is nice the recoil on the guns feels good and the designs and which weapons they decide to implement They used to add guns pretty frequently and did so around the time they were in early access but that has slowed down and they rarely add guns to the game anymore I believe it s been around 3 months  when this review is posted that they still have not added a new gun which leads to a bit of a bore when it comes to weapon choices This game has it s fair share of hit registration issues and it s a bit difficult to learn how bullet drop works on some of the 4x scopes since they ve changed them in recent updates It takes practice I understand but I ve been at the game for 100 hours since they ve changed them and I still can t figure them outNow for this next subject I wasn t really sure where to place this but I suppose it ll do well in the guns and gunfights section  Loot distribution   It s completely random which I hate It s a very strong word but it repels me from dropping to hot drop locations like  School Prison etc I cannot explain to you how many times I ve gone through whole buildings and never found a single weapon while the guy in the house next to me finds an assault rifle and kills me right out the gate Or if we re in the same building and it s a large building with a lot of rooms I will go through 2 4 rooms and either find nothing or a pistol in which my opponent finds a shotgun or a rifle and proceeds to kill me because he either has the full advantage since I have no weapon or has a very high advantage because he has a much more high powered weapon Now I understand fully that this is a battle royale game but that title doesn t give it the right to straight up  not give me a chance to fight back within the first few seconds of the game  It s unappealing and generally makes you frustrated and angry when you get screwed by RNG multiple times over I will also say that you could drop in the middle of nowhere since you have bad RNG but this gets extremely boring and is also not a good way to learn the game in the first placeNow that I ve finished talkings about the guns and loot distribution I want to go into the maps I want to start with Erangel since this is the original map on PUBG Now I will say this The map is far from perfect But it s well designed enough that everyone is content with the map and the way it works Cities and forests which allow you to traverse from and to each other pretty well even with some mountains and hills in the mix It s all around a very well designed map though it has it s flaws It s very well loved and it deserves the love it gets because no matter how many times you play it it s always fresh with the scenery and the enviroments you fight in The buildings in the map are simple and well laid out like I said the loot distribution is a bit wonky but they re still nice to fight in and are pretty easy to learn where the loot usually spawnsNow I will move on to the sandy deserts of Miramar I absolutely with all my heart hate this map I do not like how much a height advantage can screw you over on this map It s hard to traverse and the circle closing in with hills all around you usually makes you a perfect target ripe for the picking The terrain is hot buns while most vehicles cannot go too fast on it without flipping and while trying to find cover in defilades could be a nice change of pace there are too many hills and the gunfights in these hills are just not pleasureable in the least The buildings are too big and have too much going on in them They feel sloppy and the loot is too spread out in this buildings and will make you spend a lot of your time just trying to find a decent helmet or attatchments Erangel does better with more simple buildings that are not dull and are fun to fight in Games also last a lot longer on Miramar simply because of how big the landmass is This can lead to frustration if you lose in the top 10  because it takes you so goddamn long just to get there in the first place One thing that lead me down the path to hating Miramar is it seems that you find yourself on the map more than you find yourself on the original Erangel I consistently find 3 4 games in a row on Miramar and have even found around  7  games in a row on Miramar I am not exaggerating when I say 7 that is a real number and it is part of why I deeply hate this map Movement is clunky gunfights are not fun buildings are too complex and take too long to loot and the sun glaring in your eyes always makes targets hard to see It s a huge mess of a map and I hope they remake it one dayNow I cannot say much about the new map  Savage  coming out soon however it looks very well laid out with the buildings having a simple design on Erangel Even though I have lost much interest in this game I will definitely come back to try out the new map as it s small scale brings more action and might just breathe new life into the gameEvents  Bluehole have decided to implement events around a month  ago  when this review is posted and all around I think it s a good idea However their ideas for event gamemodes have been lack luster and they don t stick around too long which is also another let down in of itself They could really make the game more interesting with these events but they need to be longer and they need to come up with more fresh interesting ideas All in all the idea is good the execution is lackingI would wait to see if Bluehole decides they care about the game enough to see more bug fixes and performance issues lifted  My overall experience with the game goes as follows   I loved the game when I bought it in early access and I loved it up to the release and about two months after that release Then the game became tedious and boring for multiple reasons one of which being the new map I would be willing to play the game more if they breathed new life into the game with some new content but for right now I can t bring myself to play it because of the preformance issues I suffer to pair with the gameplay that is slowly becoming boring and stale
As of right now I can t recommend the game while yes the devs are updating the game there are still plenty of bugs and problems like hackers that seem to be ignored I die from someone who is blantly cheating like every 5 or 6 matches and it is pretty annoying The game is at it s best when you re screwing around with friends Instead of fixing the game they come out with new maps and  fix  things that don t need to be  fixed  Luckily I have a 1080 and it runs perfectly at 120 FPS with no issues But on lesser graphics card like a 970 the game runs at less than 60 FPS which is not okay Another example of poor dev  decisions is the god aweful loot crate system they have I don t mind if it s cosmetic only but when you have to charge 2 or 3 bucks to get a key that s where I draw the line I have to earn the stupid BP and why can t I open it for free  while yes i realize some crates can open for free it s not enough The core gameplay is fun but the game needs a lot of improvement before i can really recommend the game
Very satisfied
Found an ump in the house No medkit no painkiller no attachments no nothingFought my way through a lot of enemies Killed them murdered them slaughtered themAlright i can loot them nowLooted Find kar98 with suppressor and 8x scope Find fully kitted m416 Heaven is realFound a dacia cool I can go to the middle of the circleDidn t see a 1 inch rock car does 4798 flips crashes and burnsBest game ever1110
EZ
Love and Hate are very close to each other After 10 its mostly hate The Rubberbanding is verylike very very bad in the beginnings of the matches to the point where i die because i cant pick up a gunor i do it 6 times Dont buy it not now wait until its out of EAoh wait
This game gives a thrilling rush everytime you engage an enemy When I first started playing seeing people would cause my heart to beat uncontrollably and make me actually fear what was going to happen That thrill is worth the money
Game is perfect the developers release really good huge updates every month I totally recommend this for 30 bucks The cons are that when you play duo people usually dont have a mic so its really hard to communicate and somehow   tell   thats there is an enemy nearby Same goes for the squad 4 people armybut most of the time  3 out of 4 people have mics It comes to luck really on what teamate you will get with a mic or not When they develop the game even more ill give it 10 out of 10 but now 8 out of 10
I do not recommend this game at all Sure it s fun but it s a massive pile of crap Net code issues sounds not working and game breaking bugs Not to mention the rampant cheating Do yourself a favor and go play Fortnite at least it works
I ve played for like a week and I m loving it even when I lose the game is still pretty fun I haven t had this fun in a lot of time and yes the game does need optimization in general and bug fixes a lot but I m sure it will be just fine in the future
Fun game with pretty good RNG so you get basic items that you need quickly  unlike H1Z1More fun to play with friends because it gets tedious dropping and getting killed around  30 40 if you re newer to the game
NEEDS too much graphics can t play on a bit low end pc sad
Great game but can be annoying as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  sometimes
Dont believe on other people who commend LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about this game the game is awesome and i think its pretty worth it
Achei que me arrependeria de comprar esse jogo igual aquela msica always do Bon Jovi Mas foi totalmente ao contrrio acho que depois de GTA e Arma 3 foi uma das melhores experincias multiplayer que tive recomendo fortemente Jogo no est completo ainda tem diversos problemas mas no  um jogo injusto s depende de vc e da sua sorte ser um bom player nesse jogo  desafiador recomendo ter um grupo de amigos para jogar com voc a experincia fica mais divertida e vicianteContinua com diversos problemas mas t melhorando
Das ist ein gd meme xDAll jokes aside at the time i am writing this review i have around 7 hours in the game and its very fun If you can get a friend to play it  that is how I starter it s realy fun Yes it is still in early access so you need to forgive to some bugs and glitches but it is still a very enjoyable game The updates are very frequent and good new guns bug fixes soon we will have an another map etc The biggest issue is the community but i would say that atleast 75  of people are nice and friendly  so far in my experiences Some people well you better mute the chat  Screaming in the mic Saying curs words and the N word I would recommend this game but stay cool cuz sometimes you might rage Thanks for reading my review I wish you the bestest day   EDIT  currently there is a big boom around the trading sistem I hope they will fix it soon And to all who say the game is dumb and unplayable you need to know no pain no gain   
this game is insane so fun to play i allways find myself starting off with a few friends having a laugh then once more and more players start dropping off it more and more intense  gets crazy towards the last 20 25 people alive this game is 100  worth buying if you are deciding to buy this or H1Z1 GET THIS ONE  do not buy H1Z1 Trust me 5  game and really is worth the asking price
legit used to be good but then the devs was like you like the game we can t have that then the ruined the game people tend to crash alot hackers are legit in almost ery match the guns system is broken i tend to see alot of people get sniped by a guy with shotgun a guns default mode is single fire not auto fire a gun like a ak 2 times then you would be aiming at the sky it shakes like a 8 year old is holding a gun from all the royal games i played this is the only game i cannot injoy playing worst game i have ever played and there is some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ones out there
This is battle royale done correctly The optimization could use a lot of work but hey That s what I get for getting it in early access You have my attention PUBG Don t fail me
First few games I was landing in some of the  quieter  areas to try and get some weapons without being shotgunned straight back to the lobby It worked most of the time but for me the real fun lies in landing in the towns school or  my personal favourite the prison I do still find myself cowering in a building at times thoughTHIS GAME WILL CONSUME YOU Because of the  one life and game over  style you genuinely feel it when you re under fire and that only gets more intense as the number of players decrease I can t describe how awesome it is to get your first chicken dinnerA few bugs as expected from an early access game but the dev team communicate with the players well and I can only see this game improving with the new maps on the horizon If you re not already one of the millions playing this game I d recommend you get involved
Very fun game and addicting cant stop playing just lags when i open up inventory any help 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME I SHOT A GUY IN THE HEAD  TIMES WITH A SHOTGUN WITHIN 1 METER AND HE DIDNT DIE SO I DONT RECOMMEND THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME

LOVE this game Fluid fast and fun Two suggestions  1 Give us 10 15mins for the intial start of the game before the circle of death closes in Those first few minutes are crucial for gathering gear Allow us to explore more and get some awesome gear before we have to rundrive cross country2 More vehicles please

This game is entertaining for a couple hours but there s no real drive to keep playing No real customization or any depth The graphics make you want to vomit if you ve played any AAA FPS in the last 5 years
Since first Arma 2 Battle Royale mod has releasedthis is the best battle royale game i ve seenYesit has some optimization problems and bugs but the game is still in early access and the developers work hard to fix bugs etcIt s fun to play solo but the most fun part is playing duo and squadthey are so much funnier then playing soloPUBG All
This game right now is a cesspool of lag bad hitreg and other annoying bugs All the videos you see from streamers and youtubers   yeah they re edited to begin with but those people can afford the best LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing internet there isI have a really good internet connection myself but if it isnt top notch you will lag for no LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing reason NO OTHER GAME HAS THIS ISSUEThe other thing are campers constant LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing campers who sit in a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing building THE WHOLE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME and just wait HOW IS THIS FUN  I always try to be the aggressor but you are PUNISHED for that and to top it all off the 3rd person perspective  which is my preferred gamemode rewards camping even more The movement is cringeworthy i swear if you want to jump over the tiniest ledge you will fail and lose all LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing momentum its like youre a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing balloon and before your char starts running again it takes him about 3 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing seconds  which is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing a lot in a game like this where reaction is keyAnd before the fanboys storm in here and start spewing their nerd juices all over the place I AM AWARE THAT THIS GAME IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENTAnd i really think the devs will turn it around and make it great maybe even get some better LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing servers while they re at it But untill then i give it a negative reviewWait about half a year  maybe more before you buy it guys

Great game has ruski map and lot vodka buy if u are true ruski
Before I start this review off a couple of things In case someone just throws the good ol   git gud  or  ur bad   inb4 that btw1 I m in the top 3 percent in every FPP gamemode2 I get wins often3 I m not new to battle royale games4 I m good at every other tactical FPS game I ve playedAlright is PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds fun  It s about as fun as paintball Why do I say this  Well this game can be fun and it can be painful No words can describe the amazing feeling after an amazing kill and amazing win Or the hilarious moments after running a dude over and having them scream in anger into their mic But that s my first point the voice chat People in spawn and in plane are literally the most mentally challenged people you ll hear in your life Almost everyone is toxic when you kill them and it just seems everyone wants to be loud and annoying People who copy stream snipers and even pretend to be them are well I ll put it this way  Absolute Degenerates  I usually keep the voice chat muted and that s why it s on the bottom of the listNext up are of course cheaters You see it s important not to call them hackers because all they did was look up  freepubghackscom  and did absolutely nothing to the code it or anything But anyway they are a problem it really ruins the experience when somebody snaps to your head and kills you within 02 seconds I usually don t encounter too many but high up they are a problem I think Bluehole really needs to step up their anti cheat because a lot of this is ridiculous Next up is the netcode It s not really fun in a game when you get shot behind cover multiple times These people with terrible connections come from other regions and always get me when I m behind cover Either a good region lock should be applied or the netcode could be better My connection is no issue I play in NA I have low ping and high download speeds I don t really think this game is  E Sports Ready I m not saying the game is all bad there are good aspects I really like their balancing something other games and devs can t pull off This game can give good guns but it all doesn t matter if you don t have a strategy My hardware I had back then well wasn t so good But they really pulled off an amazing performance update that I loved to death I didn t crash anymore buildings would finally load Will I still be playing this game  YesWould I recommend anyone to start playing this game  NoUntil a lot of bugs glitches cheaters and etc are fixed wouldn t really recommend to a friend
Fun  Yee
HI
fun game but it s terribly optimised and very expensive
Great concept though its not yet worth the price of admission Its mostly third person  you can do first person but its not great and the feel of the weaponry in combat is clunky Will be keeping an eye on its progress though if they improve the shooter aspect of the game it will be great funFor sake of comparison others may disagree with me but i like the feel of the combat in BF1 If this game had something approaching that feel for the weapons in combat with this settingit would be amazing
It s good but theres not enough skirts
Bring FPP to SEA please
This game is so addictive and fun the only problem is that 50  of the people playing this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cowards hiding in a corner 70  of the game So If you want a game where 75  of the games end by you getting killed by a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hiding in a corner or a bush this is a game for you
not gonna load wtf
Early Access No LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Kappa123
The game is really really popular at early access I play this on a regular basis All I am waiting for is for this game to be optimized   can t wait to see what happens when the game is officially released
Whats better Getting the game optimized fix bugs more content NEW MAP     or micro transactions to fund their shiity tournamentPlayer Uknown  BABY WE GOIN WITH THE GOD DAMN MONEY HELL YESPlayers   fix the game you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  still kinda fun
 Pubg corp       The game
Hey do you like one same concept  Over and over and over and over Then PUBG is the game for you You plan your drop point you skydive out of a plane to your destination The you loot all the surrounding places then you continue to survive as you kill other players get into the right and tighter space of the gaselectric field That s it Over and over and over Hey Deadlypants have some variety
Yeah she ll be right banga of a game i d give her a 910
Great era of H1Z1 Too bad this patch can t climb a ladderhope next patch wil be better
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sick gaem

Good gameI love it
this game is pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i loot when you have a good gun  you dont get a scope
the year is 2017 i dont know how i know but i doi woke up on an island along with about 100 other people they started yelling weird LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in different languages at each other some of them found weapons they started firing into the crowd of the rest of us blood fire and smoke was everywhere but it didnt seem to hurt anyonesuddenly out of nowhere everything turns black and i wake up in an airplane with the same people as before im not sure if they all know whats going on or they have all lost their mind as im starting to since they are all still screaming like crazythe hatch on the plane opens and people start jumping out still yelling what i assume is battlecriesthe plane is about half empty when i decide to take the chance and jump out looking for cover in any building i can and hoping for some supplies and possibly some weapons to defend myself should the need ariseafter a couple of minutes i see a blue wall kinda thing come rushing towards me it scares the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of me and i run as fast as i can away from it looking for some kind of vehicle adrenaline is pumping as i spot a jeep in the distance i get into it and start driving at full speed over hills and fiels to get away from what i have come to call  the blue death as i drive shots are being fired in the distance and hitting the jeep i start evasive maneuvers and avoid being shot to death from whoever and whereever it wasi noticed the blue death stopping behind me and i start looking for new covera nice 2 story house with ammunition inside should do just fine when i get to the 2nd floor i see a medkit on the floor which should come in handy later just as im about to pick it up i hear a sound behind meF    some idiot was hiding behind the door having put the medkit there as bait before i get to draw my weapon he shot my head offeverything got black and i wake upback on the island with 100 other peoplewondering when this hell will stop
I love the game its fun to play with friends and you need good comunication skills in order to win
This game is pretty good School is a deathtrap
addicting game but the hackers need to go
I freakin  love this Game 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er killed me with a shotty
Great game  It can be super heart pumping when you make it toward the end and a bag of suck if you die in the first two minutes  A game you hate that you like it so much
Incredibly buggy yet fun to play overall I don t like how copypaste every last bit of the game is to make it such a large map but I have hopes that the final release has more attentian put to the details The gameplay is incredibly heart pounding I can t think of any other game that pumps you up as much during a gunfight Only downside is how quick the gunfights can end but if you play enough you will get plenty of situations that make up for it There are times where the game pisses me off plenty but then again I ve only paid 30 bucks for this game and already put multiple hours into it without any hopes of stopping This game is addicting
I really enjoy playing the game
This is a great game despite the flaws It doesn t work great on my computer for some reason even with a decent graphics card and a decent internet connection Other than that I love the gameThere are a few things that annoy me The main reason I get annoyed is I don t know how I died Another game I love CS GO gives you a replay of how you died so you can learn from it In this game you die the end And you will die No matter how well you play you will die There is always somebody outside the play area miles away from where we should be heading with only seconds to get there I get shot and I am left wondering if the player knows they are about to die by an unexplained electorical forceOne thing that would interest me at least is to have some kind of backstory This game reminds me of some of my favorite movies Battle Royale Hunger Games and some others The battle in those are explained even if it is a terrible explanation but it is explained I would like a little backstory in this game I don t know how it could be done in this game besides some tutorial but it would be greatSo overall this is a great game if you can get over the flaws and have the patience to deal with unexplained death from nowhere even when the area should be clear The graphics aren t great  playing on low settings is a must if you plan on hiding in the grass and you will if you want to live but the game is fun I haven t played any of the similar games that are always mentioned but I can see how this would be the best one so far
Well I will only say that the first week I bought it at the end of the week I had like 120hours of gameplay
why you have to be mad its only gaem
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game has gotten me killed so many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing times because of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lag
Good game need optimisation tho You need a very good pc to play with but still good
Not recommended in actual stateCrashes like every 30 40 Minutes and is unplayable

THE GAME CRASHES EVERY TIME I TRY TO PLAY
it drives me crazy
The game has ALOT of potential but right now the game has alot of bugs does not have alot of content hackers and alot more issues The devs could fix these things but I dont feel like they are going to do it If they are This game could become a masterpieceOverall  610 Has alot of potential but is far away from being complete
911 but stop redzoning poLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i
Awesome game Chicken dinner bebeh
This game is good Makes you rage alotBunch of chinese peopleChina 1Great FPSBetter than FortniteBut winning makes you forget all this hellSo just stop whining and win
This game is incredibly intense and enjoyable Recommended that you play with friends and have a headset because sight sound and communication are essential in this battle royale esque gameW A R N I N G  THIS GAME IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HARD CASUALS AND EXPERIENCED PLAYERS BEWARE THIS GAME WILL TEST YOUR PATIENCEOn another note please be aware that this game is in early access for a reason so expect bugs as well as the occasional crash if you don t have at least decent PC specs
AMAZING
I love this game Sure the game runs pretty poorly and has some glitches but it s understandable since the game is still in early access It s the most fun I ve had with a video game in a while and it gives me an adrenaline rush that no other game has achieved to give me Also the devs are adding new content and are fixing the glitches very frequently Definately recommend this game
fun game
Addicted
Can t blame this game for remaining in the top sellers day in and day out Amazing shooter immensly satisfying and still in development
Cant recommend enough Buy it while its still 30 dollars This is a must own I dont usually like pvp but this game is intense and amazing You jump out of an airplane with 99 other people and everyone starts with nothing You hit the ground and run hoping no one saw you or landed near you Its like hunger games on steroids Graphics are beautiful and gameplay is fun and easy to learn quickly BUY IT  
Very solid game Looking forward to further optimisations
dont buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game very poorly optimized and the bugs here are just ridiculus
Servers are too busy
It s not okay for the developers to release content for other regions but still charge us in Oceania FULL PRICE for LESS THAN THE FULL GAME GIVE US FPP SERVERS OR A REFUND NOW
PUBG is the best game ever it is enjoyable and its very fun to play
This game is just awesome the only problem is that i fill all the requirements for the game but i have a lot of frame drops even at very low i play more high end games on high settings 50 60 fps and on pubg the frames cant stand on 60 for to long even at very low But its early access so the game is under development at this point so i hope that will be fixed at the future
Great game with supportive devs
Only fun with friends  Playing by yourself will give you cardiac arrest
PLAYERUNKNOWN S RNG SIMULATOR10 is a joke
Best BR game out Hands down
Really great game recomended to anyone that like shooters
This is a very fun game in which you are thrust into a massive abandoned island setting with 99 other players to see who can be the last person standing as you scourage for weapons and gear to help you survive Despite having the game for a little more than a month i ve already sunk almost 24 hours into this game It is very fun and I would recomend picking it up for an overall good experience Though it does contain a few bugs it is expected from an early access title None of the bugs I have experienced are major or gamebreaking but I have heard of bugs that are
Is good
LORT
what can i say i love falling out the sky with nothing but my parachute then run to the nearest house to find a waepon and some armour to cover my buttocks then run around hunting people down till im the last one alive 1010 well done
If you leave a game with a streamer in it you ll be banned for  stream leaving  as it s a form of stream sniping
Good game It s addictive But hard at once this game will improve your gamesense and aim skills No tactics is needed to play this game all you need is Aim and Game Sense
This game is clunky cpu and gpu heavy the overall game play is the best there is not  Shooter in the same class right now 750 hours to prove its addicting
briliant game

Life of Playunknowns Battleground playersJump from PlaneLand on SchoolDie 
Third person FoV is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and the devs don t care That was bad enough but the new skine game just kills me WHY DO ALL OF THE GIRLY CLOTHES COST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS  You couldn t make a single skirt variant common  What the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is this world where skirts are scarcer than plutonium yet I can find a few perfectly good pairs of trousers in every third bombed out hovel I visit What a tasteless and half LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  way of trying to cash in on the skine economy early It s too bad really I like the game and I will probably keep playing for now but I really hate PU and the devs right now Could you put a little more work into the game itself before you try and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  me sideways over the cosmetics that I want  I ve dropped hundreds on CSGO and Overwatch but those are complete games produced and maintained by companies that have proven themselves capable and competent  enough to maintain their playerbases Bluehole has not yet put forth that level of effort and this whole thing reeks of a flash in the pan money grab
Damn good game makes my heart race A few problems here and there but none too major and the team play is epic
realy nice game
Game Machine Broke
I would recommend this game to anybody under the following conditions that you should follow 1 Start off by playing solo for a couple of hours then play in a party with friends2 Do not care about the clothes or  supplies  that you get from rewards as they are very disapointing3 Have the urge to get a kill intead of hiding until last 30 as that would give you less rewards or  battlepoints 4 Never get angry when you get killed by someone and you couldn t do anything about it Try being calm and enter a new game or just don t rageI wouldn t recommend this game under the following condtions that occur 1 Quitting the after dying in the first 3 min of the game2 Many glitches such as random barriers that you will crash against or getting stuck in doors3 Getting bad loot can mean you have bad luck and will have a 999  chance of dying before last 204 You won t spot an enemy when they are hiding in random grass fields that are about 10 meters from you Rendering is poor in this gameI highly recommend this game if you have friends that play this Playing alone is pretty boring and you can easily get fed up with the game
When this game works it is a very fun game just needs a better rewards system   more variety is never bad Still beta so it has a chance to still be even more amazing
If the devs keep updating on the performnce side as of glitches and bugs then this game will turn out great But if they go the Gaben route and instead of listening to the community add in a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of things such as micro transactions to get people to buy them I m hoping that wont happen in the early development if it does rip this game Otherwise I think that I m on  the fence giving this a thumbs up or a thumbs down for now i would recommend this game for its an awesome game to play with you budddy s
It really requires a lot of works on optimization An excellent game needs to work fluently in order to become a classic
One word to describe this royale  playerunknown s battlegrounds  is  fasciating  Most people and most of us already have imagined a game that is sth similar to this However no one ever actually created this massive world  Thanks to whoever created this game and thanks to whoever realized or opened this battle royale for us  I am enjoying it
it s shitand the devs are to
Game is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing mess and the devs are starting to pull the old  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it game is ea but we ve already made millions  trick but they haven t completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up yet Either way PUBG is still the best game in its genre and isn t completely painful to play
a waste of time game winning severly depends on how low you can turn your graphical settings and bullet drop  hit box system is very poorly put togehter the term ALPHA on almost all Alpha games is an excuse not to blame the developers for how bad the game is as it is not a finished product yet but you pay full price for it anyway bad server stability no objectives or reward system after all this time from release extremely poor customer support and fan support and customization bad controles horrible ergonomics and mechanics let alone the play style and the vast open areas with no cover LUCK is the ultimate winning factorfalse hype about this game pushed me to buy it and get disappointed with it in a matter of 2 weeks 30 ill never get back
Played only a couple of hours but it s amazing both in solo and coop play Definetly worth the 30 EUR Buy it
This game is great it was made by the creator of H1Z1 which is now known as 2 games  king of the kill  and  Just Survive If you like Battle royale style play then this is the best thing on the market right now oh yeah word of advice  bring a friend
morQ saRyoR
I love this game i had H1Z1 and I didnt like it but this game i love You should get this game
I shoot people and that is fun
eh bad optimization horrible servers massive rubberbanding broken hitboxes skip until fixed
Best Battle Royale game out
I love this game and enjoy all the newest updates I m  looking forward to whats in store for this game as well as maybe some new maps or so would surely be nice Keep up the great work
No Thanks
27 hours in the game and I loved every moment of it Sure the game is unoptimized buggy but the game is better now than when I bought it which is a month ago The devs are working on it They didn t  leave  the game as few people sayAlso it s not THAT bad how the fortnite fanboys tell it I personally will never play that garbage cause they totally ripped off PUBG100  recommended  I don t like the crate system though
I really enjoy this game and i feel like it gets a much worse rep than it deserves
The most recent update makes gaining battle points  BP a shore Before you got your points when your team got wiped but now the game requires you to watch thw whole match to its end by  spectating  thew enemy that killed you or the enemy that kills them thats about 30 minutes of time to get 50 BP I find it quite angering Get Fortnite instead at least its free
Game is terrible Full of people who cheatglitchhack
It s PUBG just buy it
Drop out of the air only to be greeted by textures that won t load for another 2 minutes Aim at someone with a gun BAM microstutters No way of telling where you got shot from and yes if you are a human that gets shot you can atleast tell which direction it came from Plus when I open my backpack it takes 17 seconds exactly to actually open
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I get a huge migraine playing this gameIts lack of brightnessgamma sliders and the intense glare from the ground  why is the ground shiny  gives me a horrible headachemigraine after playing for more than an hour at a timeThe game is also very unoptimized I m running a decent rig that can run most modern games on ultra yet this game lags when there s an explosion  running it on low I personally don t like the main menu but it is slick I know many people who like that sort of thing In its current state I would say DO NOT get it When these problems are addressed I definately would suggest getting itCurrent state  710  3 points for poor optimizationgraphics optionsI will return to review the game when it is released Stay tunedFULL RELEASE REVIEW They have REALLY improved upon this game The optimizationgraphics doesn t suck anymore  with the exception of network lag which continues to be a problem to this day PUBG is finally the game it should be and I m happy they stuck with it If I m being honest I was expecting them to take the money and run but that is not the case with this gameI wish there were more modes though The only mode available is being deployed across one of the two maps and scavenging homes to find weapons What about a version of the game where you are spawned in with a pistol already in your hand  This makes everyone a threat Or what about a close quarters game mode where you throw a bunch of people into a building and it s essentially a free for all until one man stands There are MANY creative directions this game could have gone and they didn t really take advantage of that I truly hope they do look into improving upon the game in the near future because what they have right now is great albeit repetetive910   An awesome game still plagued by poor network structure and uninspired game modes I cannot wait for the future of PUBG
Cashed out on there game and said LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you guys not working on it no more

Good game already has hackers Please make your security tighter if possible Here is a link to one of the many hacks just as a heads up so you know what you re up against http wwwLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE netforumforumdisplayphp f913
Think i can write a review after playing the game for a decent amount of time not 5 minutes like some poeple  Such a good game it can be quite demanding on your rig if its notup there spec wise but with a middle of the field or below PC can still enjoy the game my PC isnt the best and tbh i struggle to get 60FPS on low but still love this game and all it offers definitely worth the price considering the amount of time you can throw at it and enjoyment you can get out of it Good luck on your Chicken Dinners and even more 2nd Places   Anyone that says that the developers arent doing anyhting hasnt got a clue they are constantly moving the game forward Yes there are issues and Yes there are crashes and connection issues but this is still an early access game and it performs really well for somthing not on full releaseupdated  new patch 10 makes this definitely 100x better performance is up and the new map is quality actually dont like the old map anymore because the new map is so good  D
very noice
  Edit  The last update largely fixed the server lag issue which was my main moan I now have to change this review to  Awesome   buy it immediatelyOne thing hasn t changed   I still suck at the game   doesn t seem to stop it being fun though
PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i
Ban for feeling horny WTF
Good LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  my guys much better than king of the kill
This game is pretty simple and easy to understand But you will get killed AlotI ll probably give this an 7510
This game is easy to pick up and is a lot of funMicrotransactions are only bad if you make them they obviously don t effect the game
While PUBG is yet another Battle Royale game it s the first one that really feels like it does it right Yes the game is in early access and yes there are going to be bugs but overall it s a throroughly enjoyable experience that balances a nerve wracking build up of tension with an explosive burst of release just right The game is just damn fun
e s p o r t s   r e a d y
good game

Just buy it
i m 2 hours in and thought i would give my opinion PUBG is a fun game rule enforcement seems to be good I come from a fps background so for me the game is pretty easy i came third in my second solo game with 7 kills but otherwise i think the 3rd person would feel weird to certain people The devs seem to be okay other than banning legit players but hopefully that will change as its had so much publicity At its currant state the game would not run on your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  parents laptop setup which you get 100 fps in CS GO i have a gtx 960m and i7 6700hq so not a bad setup and i only get 30 40 on LOWEST You would definately need a dedicated GPU But if you feel your setup will run it definately give it a try
I haven t played this game long but this favoritism employed by the devs towards streamer in the last few daysweek is simply disgusting In my opinion if they continue on this path the only people left will be the streamers who will then just an each other and so onI get that having power is a subjectiv state and can span to games as well but having the power to ban people should come with responsability and judging right from wrong watching game videos on these  stream snipingshonking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  whatever  and taking the time to actually deciding if it was what the streamer called it or if it was just a simple coincidence that can even happen to  almighty  streamers
great shooter gameBut you will get ban for killing streamer
This is bar far my favourite game at the moment
Good all rounded game
really good game
The greatest China 1 simulator on the market There is also an extremely intense and unpredictable battle royale part and that s petty fun too
I enjoyed my 6 months of stage 4 cancer more than i enjoyed this game
I left a negative review for the game a long time ago then i changed it to positive because things started changing and things were getting better with the game Well dont buy this game Hackers are filled in the servers and it seems like Bluehole is doing nothing about it Almost every game I play I get killed by a headshot the second they see a pixel Dont waste your hard earned money on this game Until change is done about the hacks this pathetic game should not be bought unless it very cheap
Dont waste your money The game is not optimized as of yet Ive tried everything to get my FPS up still getting an average of 18 FPS Unplayable unenjoyable
The 1st game ever where you die not because of your skill but from the fact that you crash into something on the car in a completely horizontal fieldUPD  I ve been playing SW  Battlefront 2 on my 2013 PC on Medium High settings and I had better optimization than in PUBG with VERY LOW settings and screen scale 90 UPD2  Da a amn I play R6S with Ultra settings and I have 90fps average Feels bad for console players
910I love this game I have not won a single round yet with 75 hours on it but I still love to play it and try to win
Laggy for some reason and some optimization failures but other than that i love this game
It s a fun game that is challenging and addicting Advance at your own risk
A game that goes out of its way to protect streamers is doing it wrong Many other publishers make it up to the streamer to set a delay or just deal with what comes Banning on the off chance that you might have stream sniped is stupid There is no way to 100  prove anyone is stream sniping and innocent players are deff getting banned This is such a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  rule to try to cling to the Twitch streaming community Once the new hottness takes over PUBGS will lose the streamers no matter how hard they try to pamper them Change the rule
Really fun game
It s not a bad game and I love to play it However after seeing people getting banned for stream sniping without a shred of evidence It s clear that they are bending over backwards for streamers I will not play this game again until that is reversed Please note I have not been banned but with it being so easy to be banned from a butthurt streamer I will not even take the chance
Welcome to the CHINESE THUNDERDOME LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  enjoy the aimbots
Now the game has been fully released and it is still going to be one of the most popular games for the next upcoming years However I could look past the terrible sound design hacking bugsconstantly crashing necessity to sometimes have 30GBs of RAM poor optimization and terrible loot spawns when it was in early access because that s what I expectBut after 20 more hours in live I can say firmly to not buy this YET The game is fun when everything I said above does not happen There are better ways to spend 30 dollars Save your money and wait until this game is optimized and stable
FOR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  S SAKE REGION LOCK CHINA PLEASE YOU ARE RUINING THE GAME
Solid game high replayability Great with friends or by yourself Challenging dynamics excited to see the upcoming content

Firstly I know I only have a fraction of hours on this game compared to others but I feel like I can give an unbiased opinion on this game so people can decide whether to buy it or notAs a BR game it is probably the best out there at the moment H1Z1 being it s closest competition As Player Unknown worked on both games there are lots of similarities with the games However if you are looking for a more polished gritty survival game this is defiantly the one to chose The game is growing at an outstanding rate even overtaking Dota 2 which has been king of steam for years That isn t luck though that is a good dev team making a game based on community feedback And even if they did go back on a word and added micro transactions it doesn t take away anything from the core mechanics of the game Playing PUBG is like playing a new game every time you matchmake Where you land what loot you get and the circle all affect how you have to play that match For example if I land at a group of building and get awful loot but I m in the centre of the circle I know that I have more time to loot without having to worry about getting killed by the playzone Things like this happen every game and creates and amazing adrenalin rush when you are in that crucial gunfight or looting that supply drop Throughout my 200hrs of H1Z1  on my second account I have not felt that way for about 150hrs of playing Overall even though it s an EA game it s defiantly worth the buy especially if you play H1Z1 and refuse to try PUBG Pros Great gunplayIntense matchesGames are more affected by the players actionGood dev supportEasy to learn hard to masterCons  Pricey compared to H1Z1 Still has many bugs and glitches  it s EA thoughCan be offputing to new players due to difficultyNeed an above average PC to run above 60fps constantly

how does this game need such strong hardware for how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it is 
An expansive free for all featuring paramilitary combat and tactical shooting If you feel like taking a long walk or if youre a runner this will be the most dangerous game of battle royale that youll hunger for I crammed all of those references in there just like you and 99 other contestants will get crammed into an aircraft carrier at the start of each matchYoull then be flown over a sprawling island that is dotted with barriers houses weapons and vehicles of all kinds While in the plane your ears will be subjected to high pitched squeals and horrifying racist remarks adding to the droning hum of the engines The mixed blessing of online gaming Once youve had enough you are free to parachute anywhere onto the island below From then on youll experience eerie silence marked with occasional bursts of gunfire The juxtaposition will be stunningSitting and embracing the scenery is unfortunately not on the itinerary Instead youll be rummaging through every possible nook and cranny in an ill fated attempt to arm yourself and become the last man standing As time ticks on youll be forced to center yourself within a randomly placed circle on the map that will shrink over time If youre stuck outside the circle youll be swept up and cleansed by an ominous blue wall of death It keeps the action moving and ensures you wont be stuck in a corner clutching a rifle and staring out of a window for the majority of the game PUBG is traditionally played in third person but you can easily switch to iron sights or dive into a forced first person perspective  Duo and squad modes are also available if youre one of those weird gamers that has real friends Have fun listening for footsteps together and relish the fleeting moments of an intense firefights Best of luck feeding yourselves with that ever elusive chicken dinner
Spawn inLoot a bunch of housesEncounter nobody for 30 minutesGet sniped from a guy hiding in a bushGAME OVERRinse and repeatThat s it That s basically the entire game Maybe there will be more to it later on once the game gets closer to leaving early access but for now it s probably the most boring shooter on Steam at least in singleplayer There isn t ever anybody to shoot at until 25 minutes in when the play area gets smaller You are more likely to get struck by lightning and bitten by a cobra at the same time than to see another player Playing in squads of 3 or more is actually pretty fun encounters happen more often this way But if it s just you or you and 1 friend vs everybody it s a lot of running through farms and picking up guns inside houses in the hopes that you get the chance to shoot somethingIf you have 3 players in a squad then I can actually recommend this game If you are desperate then at least have a friend to play with but that still isn t good If you re by yourself then don t even think about buying this game
This is my one of my best friends  favorite games I like to play it with him even though it s not my favorite Maybe some of your best friends will love it too
Really good game but ofc it still have some issues The only thing that really bothers me is that the stats reset after pretty much every update and it doesn t count my wins   
Rubbish don t buy
The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  won t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing open
I love this game Yes its a bit rough around the edges but thats to be expected with an early eccess game As long as they fix all the promblems with the full release i highly recommend this game for all shooter fans
this game makes me clinically depressed
Worth It
 We wont add stuff like microtransactions untill the game is done  guys i promise we wont guys oh and game itself is a buggy unoptimized mess that is just boring as hell like all other battle royale games around and lets not forget about the stream sniping bans which made me kek pretty hard tbh like seriously dude literally banned people for killing streamers so yeah not worth the money
Playerunknown s Battlergrounds is a really fun game and is really really challenging as well The game can get really buggy and glitchy at times but keep in mind this game is titled as an  Early Access  game so just wait and see the developers fix bugs and optimize the game for the better bright future for that game indeed    EDIT  After patch 10 PUBG is officialy out of the beta I must say I enjoy the game a hundred times more than I did before They improved performance the game runs very smooth now and you don t need a beast to run it anymore I got 50  more fps than I had before the patch lots of bug fixes as was expected Overall very nice and fun would recommend it to anyone

No
Laggy game and the abundance of chinese idiots who apparently dont speak english
Added microtransactions to a Early Access game can no longer recommened
It s nice Great success Yakshimash
Good game If you kill a streamer you ll get banned for stream sniping thats my favorite feature of this game
This game is good Has a lot of potential but also has a lot of bugs and glitches I mean you can expect these things from an early access game But the strong point about the game is its FUN and absolutely better than any similar games like this And yeah it also gives off Hunger Games vibe I mean who wouldn t like this game
Probably the best online game in recent years This game even after three thousand hours will be interestingAnd I hope she doesn t die in the next few years
anyone ever meet hacker before  i play with my friends squad 4 of us got killed by headshot   kar98nice
The gameplay is good but until the game devs get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together I m not recommending this game 1 You can be banned on the words of a streamer because he felt like you streamsniped or  harrassed  him with ingame mechanics like honking a car2 The implementation of very very greedy microtransactions in an early access game with the flimsiest excuse ever  If the dolphins stopped selling jerseys for a year the fans would go crazy  Yes actual quote
Well made Updates consist and improvement constantly seen
Fantastic game To give an indepth review would take hoursI am usually an RPG guy  Oblivion Skyrim Fallout etc But this tickles everything just right despite no in game advancementHands down the most intense game I have ever played Every battle has my heartrate over 120 its crazy
This is the best early access game I have ever playedThis is H1Z1 s big brother this game is Battle Royale done right Even if it s only early access it feels so good and so finished It s a brilliant game with so much replayability Definitely recommend it it s still early access so expect lots of updates like vaulting more guns and new maps910 game
CHING CHONG wabba laammma ding dong
It s exactly like H1Z1 but way better I have been playing this game so much lately
This game is broken wait till full release
It s not funlike the first 5 hours pretty goodeverything after that like my first son disappointing
Game is really fun and awesome BUT only when it actually runs Game worked for about a week and then a update bricked it for me on my end Have gone through endless troubleshooting and the support hasnt been very helpful Game is awesome and I would recommend buying it however in my case it has been a little disappointing because the game does not launch for me
THIS IS JUST LIKE MINECRAFT LOVE IT
The most buggy piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I ve ever played
Run around for an eternity trying to loot lame generic weapons in a new game engine that looks really bad unless u on at least at gtx 1080 You can tell when someones close by as the game will slightly lag when youre in the vicinty of anohter player Sounds are extremenly un realistic as it seems you have super human senses and can hear footsteps in buildings 50  meters away from you Good arcade game for the young kids and those ultra cool streamer guys who can get everyone banned cause they whinge like little LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE es when they get legitimatly killed   use stream delays derpsIve had a chicken dinner  which is when I stopped playing Most empty win of a game ive ever experiencedGTA5 did a much better job of this battle royale mode ARK has a royale mode which LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all over this alsoSo this is my opinion  but I can see alot of ppl are enjoying it  each to their own Not for me though The game has potential to be modded to the eyeballs  so I might come back when that scene is thriving
Now the chinesse hackers seem to have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed off for a while this game isnt so bad The old map is awesome the new one is aids
Sa va dau la muie cu jocu vostru coaie ca eu merg in fata imi aluneca caracterul si mor coaie sa imi suge ti toata pula MUIE
I can t recommend this game in this current state This is what most of my friends told me it s fun but it s infuriating and frustratingI would like to adress a few issues that triggered me hard  1 Directional sound in this game is rubbish There s only left and right and sometimes in between You can t differentiate between up and down front and back  One time I got killed from above when I was hearing the shots right in front of me and I couldn t figure out where the guy was he was on a roof 15 meters away from me2 You will get rekt super hard there s no way to train your aim or to check how the bullet drops so if you re just starting just get used to dieing and try to die as often as possible by taking as many with you at the startThere are many good players that will 1 tap you in an instant while you unload the whole weapon in them3 The fact that you loot 20   30 minutes and after a while you die without having a chance to fight backThese are the things that annoy me So if you re having the same triggers like me you might want to think about this The game really needs to be optimised and I swear they really need to fix the SOUND
Game suck huge LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  been playing it for around 80 hours now since release and it barely improved People be hacking cheating and bugs literally everywhere When queuing with randoms for duos or squads its most of the time a huge pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE  since they can t or won t communicate with their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  headsets   And if they do  they will insult you in like 30  of the games you playing Player are camping no matter what it ain t about skill it s just about getting him first when they least expect it It s about luck especially while looting  getting the right AR ammo scopes   first aid kits and med kits and when there are about 20 people left getting the safe zone near your current area so your opponents have to move towards you where you can easily target them while the HAVE to move towards the zone where you wont take dmg Sometimes when landing people will run you over and kill you when you have no loot at all and you were just about to drop down to earth with your parachute The game as it is in the current state is terrible no fun whatsoever Until changes have been made to the entire system the game won t be enjoyable for the majority of player
Early access with microtransactions
It s good from watching videos but you gotta have a good pc I had too refund it
Badly optimized plenty of bugs  falling through the floor textures not loading half the time no wall  yes legit wallhack game menu crashing frequently and so on ingame shop with cases terrible UI etcI have witnessed all of that with less than 10 hours of gameplay not mentioning that this game is basically a H1Z1 v2 which was already a Arma 2 BR v2 on his own
this is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  men
class bit of quick fun for those that dont have all day to sit at a PC
Camping simulator 2017
Very good game i sugest gettin it
Great game loads of fun
I used to love  this game but its actually really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 1 You should be able to shoot trough barbed fences The amount of times i died because this wasn t posible is insane2 Momvement can be really buggy and just not look realistic3 Let us choose which map we want to play4 get us a quick join button after you die5 Nades are the most unrealistic thing ever6 Really bad hitboxes7 Vaulting doesnt work all the time Sometimes i have to press my spacebar 10 times to get my character to vault8 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing worse servers than EA9 Dying because i get stuck in 1 10 gamesFix you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cancerous game Dont go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing full release when you game isnt working how its suposed to
A lot of it is luck A lot of it relies on not laggingUnfortunately I have neither To fix the loading textures bug  or at least make it better download reshademe from the official website It worked for me  DI livestream PUBG most days I start beween 8pm and 9pm Eastern US Time and end at 10pm same time zone
This game is so trash optimized i m playing on a PC with i7 and 1070 and i still have some spooky LOVE LOVE LOVE  frame dropsSad af I can have a smooth gameplay
How an average game works 1 Drop somewhere 2 Find no loot3 Get killed by a person who has found the only pistol in the game
Pros  Fun gameplay intense battles Cons  The lack of content atm does not justify the price tag Game still feels very clunky and incomplete Optimization patches have been rolled out lately but overall the game still needs a lot of work Would definitely change the review to Positive once the game is launched in a better conditionUpdate  10 Release even though the game has some vast improvements it still feels unfinished with major bugs like random crashes server lags and rubber banding
It s basically Hunger Games with guns 710
gg dogs
This game is great except for the fact that the physics are all over the place The random bullet spray is a mess The circle RNG is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing terrible and there are random crashes on top of the game constantly closing host connections and kicking people out of games
One of the most challenging fps games I have ever played really demanding on your system but if you have a rig that can run it this game is a must have Hopefully they work more on optimizing it but as it stands this game is still terrific
ultra lit  i cant stop  
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  developed game it keeps crashing textures do not load choppy as hell The genre is good this particular game is one of the worst experiences I had in years
Great game i cant wait for the new maps
If you enjoy finding a pistol while the enemy chases you down with an AK after just dropping buy this game
This game includes also Running simulatorAutorun simulatorCamping simulatorFlying simulatorLanding simulatorShip simulatorCar simulatorPlane simulatorShooting simulatorSwimming simulator1110 IGN
Bug riddled artistically bland and generic microtransactions and muh lootboxesFun for a game or two with friends but I can t exactly recommend itThis game will last exactly as long as it takes someone else to do it better
Good game fun has some graphicalsound issues play well feel good
trashy poorly optimized early acess cashgrab with microtransactions and lootcratesplay this if you want to play walkinglooting simulator and then get one shot by random sniper guy that had more luck then you looting a kark rifle also the game is full of hackers
Start on islandPunch everyone in the faceWarp to planeParachute down instantlyLand with another personGet Kurt CobainedRepeat1110 game would die again
BEST GAME EVERY
Game is enjoyable but unless Playerunknown gets his LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together and stops letting streamers run his business this game deserves to die
Very good game for a decent price fun to play with friends or even alone sometimes dont want to spend money on crates  then dont no one is forcing you  
tHIS GAME MAKE ME ANGRY MEN
Fun when you re engaged but the game gets boring very quickly as you run across the whole map and only see 1 2 teams unless you re lucky If you dont have a problem with passive play this is a game for you but if you re aggressive you ll find it hard to find teams outside of the initial drop into a crowded town The hit detection is also horrible as you ll be aimed right on someone but hit the obstacle you re taking cover behind even if you re looking over it But other than them issues the game is pretty fun if you re playing with a friend or friends as you can keep eachother entertained while running 2 km to not find anyone So i have mixed feelings here but yeah why not go for it
Balant unoptimized bull wankUpdate  Still a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  overhyped game  
every few games theres some way you get stuck in the map i dont get why they cant just fix pochiki before they add a new island i mean valve makes better maps than you
Got my first win after 60 hours I only realized I was 60 hours in after that win though now 15 hours later I have 4 6 more wins and cannot stop having fun even with the occasional lag
this game got boring fortnites better
garbageOh look Another dev team with a broken early access title that arbitrarily decides that their game is done and out of early access Congrats on your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  blueballs
This game is amazing 330 hours plus played and no stopping me Tense exciting and fun For an EA game it s inredible
How do I refund my money spent on this game

Disliked
Go play a real game like Minecraft Hunger Games
So addictive
Niedopracowana gra za tyle kasy 
This game is so good and has the potential to easily become one of the most iconic   fresh breaths of air into the gaming industry  if it wasn t for the Developers behind itRight now the Devs have driven away from wanting to add new content into the game   optimise it to ensure that most people regardless of what sort of PC they have to be able to play opting instead to flooding the game with Micro Transactions and tailoring the experience purely to twitch users who only have to say  Please  to Staff Members in order to get players banned for something they haven t done Unless you are a popular streamer andor have quite a bit of money in the bank in order to suit yourself up in clothing that ll let you hide in pretty much every environment your really not gonna be able to enjoy this game in its entierity Until that attitude changes and the Devs start to realise that optimisation alongside core gameplay elements comes first   additional content comes later I can only say this Don t get itNot yet
NOT ENOUGH SPACE even when I press  z PRONE BLOCK on the flat surfaceNETWORK LAG DETECTED on a 1vs1 situationCONNECTION CLOSED when I tryna play some causal gamesHOST HAS CLOASED THE CONNECTION when I got 10 kills30 fps with a gtx 1080 pretty noice
Great game so far definately worth the money Many things still need to be fixed  mainly the lag and whatnot I would like to see a higher priority put on optimization over loot crates but it is what it is Just buy it you will not be disapointed
I bought this game not too long ago to join in with a group of friends already playing So far I have enjoyed everything about this game I love the beginning of the game dropping into the playing field and the chaos ensues from thereThere are huge differences playing in Solos Duos Squads and then each respective ques First Person mode which adds amazing amounts of different play into the game Having to actually see your enemies in you FOV is much different than just peeking around corners in Third PersonWish I would have heard about this game earlier would ve loved to pick up that set pre order cosmetic set
i eat manny chikin
this game is overrated trash cant wait for it to die
A
I m incredibly terrible at this game and incredibly hooked on it
1 get in plane2 Hear everyone screaming  China number one 3 jump out of said plane4 Land at house5 walk around corner and get merked by a guy with a shotgunoverall 1010 great game
nice game but it doesnt optimize yet
Bugs are top kek apart from that game is pretty gucci
Cheating is insane and devs don t give a damn They made their money off us and are probably moving on to their next project  or adding more cosmetics rather than bug fixes The creator would rather start LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  matches with other companies than actually finish this trash pile of a game but honestly why finish it  They made their millions and they are moving on and so am I
its a good game
it is a good game but pleace make it available for linux 
great gamebutstop banning people for no damn good reason
Garbage
gr8 g4me
I cannot in good conscience recommend this game Even with the devs being scumbags  or so I ve heard the community being cancer and poor performance aside the game itself is filled to the brim with  baloney  You got instakilled from god knows where  Too bad no kill cam so you ll never know how You get the drop on someone but they still kill you because they happened to find a better gun  Too bad better luck next time You start far outside the circle  Have fun running for seven minutes before dying a slow and boring deathI could go on but to sum up this game  it s 80  luck 15  camping and 5  skill If you have an extremely high  baloney  tolerance as I do then this game can be very fun about 5  of the time but the other 95  is either boring annoying or both at the same timePS  If you do decide to buy this game mute voice chat before you do anything else seriously people are loud and annoying
Too much campers
Let me start by saying this is not a game for everyone even if you do have a love survival type games i have over 195 hours into this game and things i have learend is that this is a game that you can be the best at and still stand a large chance of not winning PUBG is one of the fews games that tests your nerves and mind on one hand nothing is more fraustrating then being killed in the early put of a match but on another hand nothing is as tense and exelerating as being down to the final 5 10 players and definetly no feeling is as reward and exciting as winning a match there is days you will not want to touch this game and days you cannot stop playing with that aside i do love how the company is not rushing their product or killing their fan base with things such as micro transactions they are focused on updating and improving their game weekly i can honeslty give PUBG a 910 all around one of my favoriot games
Lacking in content originality and fun This 30 rip off is your basic battle royal game includes all the classic commodities that come with this cancerous genre  garbadge graphics repetitive progressionless gameplay and controls that for the majority of the time are a roll of the dice as to wheather they ll work or not With zero content unless you count the three  game modes   solo duo squad you could blaze through all that the game has to offer in the lesser half of an hour For a game that bit 30 out of my wallet it sure wants you to spend money like its a free to play The only thing this game rewards you with besides buyer s remorse and a headache is an odds against you loot crate system for useless and atrocious clothing options In final this game is not worth 30 it is not worth your time playing it into its brick wall of content and it is not a good game 110 for it works sometimes
servers are so bad can never log in because the servers are too busy stupid
it is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
played so many hours on this game and they cant even give me a key to the new map  BS and all the server lagsbugs and glitches that happen are getting out of hand i excpected more after PAYING for a game Fortnite anyone    
Full of lag frame drops and if you are in the US they update at prime hours because their player base is more important in other parts of the world
Great First shooter game
We will be playing this forever
quite laggy sometimes but overall a pretty fun game
The game is just great i love everything about it  The only thing that bothers me is sometimes the buildings dont load the textures and i cant enter them mybe it has something to do with my ram I have 8gigs of ram UPDATE fixed the non loading buildings bug
The reason you re seeing only bad reviews and not good ones is becuase the other millions of us are on the game having fun Not sitting in the reveiw section whining that the game is too intensive on the graphics or some crap1010 no other game like it Enjoy not playing bad reveiw nerds
Probably the Game of the Year for me Grab some buddies pray to the RNG gods and get ready for the most unique experience you will play for a FPS game For those complaining about micro transactions its optional and comestics only so there is no reason to cry about it
Im very sad to discover something that is going on with the Devs and how their greed hs blinded to simple truths This whole screen sniping thing I dont actually understand how a game where tags are not even available and matches are random how thats even possible unless you are incredibly lucky to get paired with a streamer and know with a hundred percent certainty that its them Its seems highly unlikely The fact that people are getting banned from the game due to complaints of popular streamer complaints its out right disgusting and the devs should be ashamed of themselves I m a very casual player and just like to get on every once in a while and play with my brother and bought the game because of watching a streamer I honestly think people who are banned should fill a class action lawsuit against bluehole if they feel they were banned without evidence To purchase a product for access and to have that taken away from you with no evidence has to be breaking a contract you make with the company upon purchasing the game that as long as you are not activly making hacks for the game or breaking any guidelines that can be proven with evidence and not just based on the words of someone because they didnt like someone honking their horn at them as they got ran over by a vehicle or some dumb LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like that that I have been reading everywhere What seemed like a good fun game to just jump into and play with your friends has quickly become tainted  Streamers are ruining the experience for everyone else and the devs should be ashamed for not standing with the community at large as a majority of players aren t streamers Another thing I find gme breaking that is absolute garbage is what is the point of even having grass  It would seem is all you have to do is turn your graphics down to get rid of grass and all thats left is a persons character sitting out in the open plane as day waiting to be shot I was shot by a guy 100 yards a way when I was on a hill in tall grass and since I have a high end graphics card I could barely see him He was at the firing range At first the game was just a jolly good time It was buggy hit detection sucked but it was always fun Now I am afraid to even get on because what if I get paired with a streamer and I run him over and he gets pissy and gets me banned because he is salty he died Then what  I m out 30  Oh and fix hand to hand combat It s a joke
great game get it get it now
So addicting and amazing
havent seen a game so bad in my entire life dont fall into the trap of giving player unknown the cucked sjw LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  your money most of the money is spent on LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  cosmetics rather than fixing the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game so they can milk more of your money all the developers they hired are all from south korea so they can save money but the developers only develop mobile games so they had no idea what they were doing and developed the most unoptimized piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on the planet you get banned for honking your horn when in the same game as a streamer yet they allow cheaters to roam free for months on end 99  of the cheaters are in china but they play on naeu servers instead but player unknown wont region lock them out because its  xenophobic  playerunknown just wants more money from the cheating LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s so he can buy nice gifts for his wifes son if you drink soy milk then you will love this game   otherwise your money is better spent buying flump necklaces
hard to get used to it
Game lags so hard when someone is in range but they don t show up until after I m dead Even a Beta should be playable
It is very hard For comparison do you kow that feeling when you prepare all your defences in Rainbow Six Siege but then as soon as you see an enemy they headshot well imagine that but if the preparing phase was 15 mins long   But somehow it is still super fun
Great and enjoyable alone or with friends
t will be a pretty good game if we could have more optimization coming up but without the low fps its a very nice and good game But a thumbs down for now
  gut gaem   110 wood recoment11
u never win
The game is fun as hell but there are some bugsglitches that you will encounter Sometimes when i fire on my enemies i think that the shot should have hit him but it doesnt dont know if its something with the hitboxes or the hit reg maybe its just me trying to think that im good at the game but well anyway its a thumbs up for me great game but i still like h1 its fun bcus i find h1 more fast phased pubg is a bit more slower phased than h1 theres more campers when the third ring hits BAM everyone camps while in h1 on the 4 5th ring i see people driving around trying to kill people wich i find very fun so what im telling you here is that dont listen to all of the haters that hates h1 sure they dont fix that many bugs and they only care about money but i got 100h on h1 and i havent encountered any bugsglitches yet believe it or not but thats true and i can promise you that so what game would i prefer the most  honestly i cant tell they are both fun ashell i love the spray mechanik in pubg i love the fast phase in h1 i like that you can jump out of cars without dying i cant decide they are both good games but depends on what is going to happen to both these games i might change my toughts in the future right now i like both games
After over 50 hours and never been 1st 1010 Would recommendEdit   today i got my first win lol
alot of people are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about getting banned for doing stuff that gives them an unfair advantage but if you just play the game and ejoy it for what it is you will have a blast its tons of fun
Very Good game Still are alot of bugs but the dev team is fixing them faster than Ive seen by anyone in a while Highly reccomend
good game       NEEDS OPTIMIZED   
300
You want a review of this game  Forget about it I m not going to tell you why this game is amazing or why it sparked the best sex I ve had in my entire life No I ll just tell you an experience I hadSo there I was jumping out of a cargo plane Racing toward the Earth in a desperate attempt to win myself dinner I didn t know Domino s was this serious in ChinaI land and run into a building that at one point must have been a home for a nice family I grabbed a hunting shotgun surely left by the former farmer and husband I pop two shells in and run to the children s bedroom where I found myself a revolver and ammo Little Susie must ve blown her little brains out with it I go into the kitchen and grab myself a machete something every kitchen wife needs in ChinaJust as I turn for the door in walks this drunken moron with a pistol He spots me and immediately turns around but not before I put a 12 gauge in his LOVE LOVE LOVE  To make sure he is dead I shot him in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Next house haas a few notable items laying on the floor including a shiny new M416 combat rifle With two boxes of 556 The residents must ve been gone and forgot their pieceI take off and head for the fields I spot another man with what appears to be a hunting rifle He shoots me and misses but my aim is better and I shoot him in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Dead on the ground he pleads for his life I cut himself a hole in his skull and relieved myself of some tension as well as some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Then I got shot in the face by some camper with an M24
This Game is Amazing Still requires alot of Bug Fixing But no matter its still fun to play with friends i hope the bring a ranked feature in the upcoming updates and lots of new maps Keep It Up Blue Hole
If you want a run n gun this isn t the right game for you  Great mix of strategy from straight survival to aggressive gunfights and technical skill  High learning curve but so addictive  No 2 rounds are the same
This is one of the greatest games I ve ever played I love the type of gameplay the map the ability to customize your weapons and all of those real life physics However I currently have an I7 4790K CPU and EVGA GTX 1080 and yet I can t run this game with  good  fps It s very badly optimized compared to games like H1Z1  KOTK or for example Counter Strike  Global Offensive But well it doesn t really matter because this game is amazing and I am in love with it It s 10 times better than H1Z1  KOTK or any other Battle Royale game I d say this game is totally worth the money if you have a good enough computer to atleast run it with 100 frames per second
Very good but hope it can add display of network latency and packet loss and the corner of screen
the multiplayer hardly works and it constantly crashes
First game spawned in and got loads of loot ran out into the red zone scared not knowing what it was heard a car behind me and ran into a shack the car rammed the shack breaking it into pieces and sending me miles 1010 would hide again
Very fun game but also a pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE  if you don t have an SSD and more than 3GB of vram I used to have a GTX 960 2GB and a standard 7200rpm hard drive then I spent about 400 on a GTX 1060 6GB and a 256gb ssd and I went from 40 50 fps on very low low settings to 70 80 fps on medium settings  both 1080p But I would recommend it 100  after some optimization or if you have a similar GPU  GTX 1060 6GB and CPU  i5 7600k OC 48ghz and any SSD or M2 drive
minecraft hunger games is better
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in awesome game but with bugs but i recommend 100 
you either get r a p e d  in the beginning because it s 100  luck based rather than skill then you sit and do LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all looking for people with around 30 alive then in the Top 10 you have no chance because everyone plays like a complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  people either lay down or crouch in bushes and jump out to kill you from behind if everyone on it wasn t a bunch of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  sucking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  then it could be a decent game
It s been over a year since PUBG was first released in early access but the servers are just unstable as they were a year ago The same game breaking glitches such as getting stuck in textures are still present The FPS is still just as bad even on low graphics on a medium tier PCBut hey now we have emotes and a 2nd  even LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ier map Yay
This game still has so many issues I cant recommend this game due to horrible combat horrible servers and horrible vehicle controls
m

Do not buy this game yet recent months influx of players have wrecked their servers and the company seems less than interested in fixing them as they try to push consoleEDIT as of 10 It was a lot of fun but if this is their 10 release I m done This game is trash filled with cheaters spilling over from the AS servers and the devs can t seem to figure out how put a ping lock on their serverssince that is so hard to do I doubt they ll make it functional anytime soon if ever At this point the game s only option is to go on sale as a cash grab before the servers crash one last time
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t game You run around 100 hours and then get your LOVE LOVE LOVE  wooped by a camper
finally got my hands on this  highly anticipated  game and I cannot even connect to play after countless tries FIX THIS BROKEN GAME YOU GREEDY DEVELOPERS
Before buying this game there is no hold ADS  It is only toggle ADS which is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a shooter game and you can t change it in the settings
Pubg is an excellent game it takes skill and patience play with homies as playing solo unless you re good  using this term relatively can get frustrating as you can spend 20 minutes surviving only to die in a few seconds Overall this game will be 1010 once finished considering my maybe naive trust in brendan greeneEdit  Apparently everyone decided to negatively review this game after a few bans because internet This is still an excellent game its early access still and I have yet to run into the bugs other people are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing about I have a radeon r9 390 paired with an i5 6500 and get 70 frames with a reshade on I was getting 80 90 before I started using reshade Yes there are drops but I blame that on my 8 gb of ram more than anything else I ve ran into many games eating my ram and it causes me to experience some issues this game is no different It s recommended for 16gb for a reason Ignore the bad reviews for the past two months for the most part Its definetly worth 30
never had such an intense love hate relationship with shotguns before
Best game I have ever played  It just sucks you in so easy especially when you get to the top 10
Lamo there are more hackers in this game than csgo

I used to love this game but now I wish that I never had brought itReasons 1 Developers had broken their promise of not selling in game content during the Early Access Only 4 month had past after early access release and they already lost honor to their own greed 2 Developers keep stuffing the game with ridiculous content For example ads all over the level They are ruining the atmosphere of their own game to advertise some stuff like online stores I mean ESL or they own tournament events on Gamescom 3 Game performance is terrible For example my 200 videocard GTX 960 can t handle the game on ultra low setting without lagging for 3 30 seconds just on landing Every second lost on landing is devastating for your survival chance because you need to arm yourself as fast as possible but instead you are lagging standing target for up to 30 secondsAnd its getting worse with every patch because developers are overloading video memory with textures of ad graffities and paid content like pink miniskirts 4 Major game bugs are left unfixed for more than 5 months for example invisible obstacles which could destroy your car when hit on5 During Gamescom tournament developers had shown themselfs from not to bright side The event had terrible score rules low quality operators performance and was overcrowded with streamers instead of good players Very very unprofessional as for my opinion I no longer believe that game will become anything good With every patch it s more game of ads and miniskirts and less about guns and tacticsThink twice before spending your time the game is very hard to learn and money on this game
Got instantly killed by a punch 2 seconds after landing57
Super fun requires a lot of skill and stratigies awesome with friends and solo and overall a great game especially for it being in early access

NAME 
Ban chinese from NA server  problem solved
Dont even have to leave a comment get the game you will not regret it
Very clunky and buggy even after months of full release
Installed the game and the setup patch failed Pretty lame for a game this massive
So upon 4 hours of playtime and a total of 12 match played I have witnessed at least 5 diffrent encounters with a hacker of some kind I ve seen people shooting near me and still killing me and people snapping directly on to my body before They have even seen me It s really hard to have fun playing solos because I don t want to ever get in a gun fight partially because of the fact that I m still new and because I afraid that the guy I m trying to go up against is going to shoot the wall next to me and still kill me How do poeple have fun ruining a great game for other people because they are bad at and need a very cheap and unfair advantage  I do not recommend this game in it s current state I hope the hacker issue gets fixed soon till then hold off on this purchase
Despite some performance issues PUBG is an excellent game I ve seen streamers play it and Didn t think it was my cup of tea but after trying it in open beta I quickly fell in love Despite sinking over 250 hours into it I still find every game to be exhilarating and unique in its own way Love the constant stream of updates too Top notch battle royale game
Love this game it has its bugs but everything else out does the bad
Unfortunately I can t in good conscience recommend this game any longerThe OCE server has been completely flooded by chinese players who wantonly use aimbot and wall hacks and get away with it game after game I have no idea how a game this big still lacks a proper anti cheat People like this essentially make top 10 impossible to win because there s ALWAYS 2 3 hackers at the end of the game We re not talking  oh I get beaten 1v1 so they re hacking  we re talking very obvious snap locking to heads massive multi kills that don t make sense or them shooting through wallsterrain from very far away in the death cam Please for the love of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing GOD region lock this game There needs to be region lock if this game is going to be playable into the future it s the one feature that it sorely needsA recent update has also included new crates the paid ones obviously being those that include any worth while loot 250 for a key just to open the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing thing in a fully paid gameOptimisation still sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE  after 10 though not quite as bad as before Bugs are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing abundant one particularly bad one caused be to die by falling as I went to vault over a stone block
Great game with friends People are upset at the microtransactions its for 30 days and to help host a tournament and some goes to charity it will be removed at the end of the month Would reccomend you have a decent rig to run this game althought I have seen people run it on lower end hardware Would reccomend it for sure 8510
Camera was extremely painful to use gameplay was boring and uninspiring would not recomend
Before you ask Yes I got my chicken dinnerThis game is a weird game The game is carried by the hype of videos and screenshots The game overall is fun you ll enjoy trekking through foreign lands trying to survive but deep inside the game is one that is a buggy mess of head scratching maniaThe movement is clunky janky and terrible You ll find yourself fighting to get into cars and out of cars you ll have a hard time going into the doors and fighting people The gun fighting in this game ranges from long range conflicts to just baboon bullet throwing When you re close up to someone all physics and gameplay is thrown out the window You can legitly shoot 5 rifle bullets at the chest of someone but due to POOR NETCODE and servers will miss every one  Even if there is a blood decal and die I found myself dying more to just silly movement then actual mistakes and yes i ve made some big mistakes where I say to myself   I Shouldnt have done that The game is ugly its unoptimized the community is bottom of the barrel because the game is so hyped everyone in the game is racist and crude You will be shut down for criticizing the game because you dont have a win The RNG will drive you mad as you look through houses finding nothing but crowbars and sickles you may just die due to the close force field because you just have bad luck End game if you do survive that long turns into a boring zzz sniper fest of just camping the hills The devs could easily fix this by changing the last closing circles into a city or maybe a farmland of some sort No I hope you like fighting on a hill with trees and bushesOne thing that confuses me is the dev saying he wants a nice realism esque game this is far from the truth The only real aspect is the ability to put random things on your gun while in reality all you need is a sniper scope for your gunThe game is fun its 30 bucks but it is over hyped beyond belief the devs keep digging themselves holes and you have streamers complaining about dying If this game was ever over 30 dollars i would strongly suggest not buying this game but 30 is pretty ok Just dont expect a game you ll have fun
Relly still no way to jump over things
Love this game Dont think selling crates warrants a thumbs down Just dont buy them
Can not open the game just a running writing please help me
So I really like the idea of this game but even after i got access to a faster wifi and waited for the game to get some performance updates it is still the laggiest game i have ever played would not recommend until it is fixed
great
good game very hard when you just start but you will get better if you keep playing
This is a really good game to chill out to and intens moments find a good friend to play with and you could play for hours
SWEET ignore bad reviews and buy  P
How about instead of releasing more micro transactions you actually fix and optimize your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game It s unplayable now and I have the clay building bug 100  of the time with no patch in sight Until you fix your game I wont support it
I SUPPORT LAWSUITS WITH NO BASE TO SUPPORT THEM
I have played this game for almost 80 hours and can say that this game is really enjoyable The game is not perfect by any means and has a lot of room for improvement but with that being said it has a charm to it that makes me come back to play it each time I have to agree with other people when they say that the game should be region locked not because I don t like players from other parts of the world but because It s more enjoyable when you can communicate with your squad in the same language the game plays well altough the FPS could be better and the servers tend to crash every once in a while other than that the game is fun and I m looking forward to see how the game improves I can definitely recommend to others to try it out
Fix all the reconnect errors and random crashes that make the game unplayable Game is extremely fun when it works
msin runnar int
Shttiest game i have ever played Worse than bad rats cant even change ADS to hold too much chinese hackers 0 tick replay system too much chinese hackers again damage system is retrded
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS GAME  I miss old LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing pubg when you actually had fun jumping up mountain the menu and the feeling of this gameNow this game is trash it has LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing vaulting system which sucks bad menu WEIRD LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING LEADERBOARD  And ofcourse the sound you can no longer hear steps  for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  sake fix this game   Bring back old PUBG 
What a nice game A time killer I could play it 247 Never gets bored  A very creative 3rdfirstperson shooter  D Zillion times better than H1Z1  D Good job dawg  3
This is one of thos games where you aren t certain if the hype is worth the 30 price tag but if your system is strong ennough I wouldd highly suggest PUBG it may take some time to get good at it but the game still gives me ann adrenaline rush when I reaeech the top 10  And I have 170 hours of play time so far
Great game gonna go over some pros and cons of everythingPros only 30no DLC  yetGreat for team PVPCons Lots of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t LOTS OF BULLLLL  Don t press F well driving everLooting feels like trash sometimes milly base is BARELY better then just looting a cityDLC is comingDon t kill streamers You will get it one day610 needs work lots of fun
Armour is still buggedBuildings are still buggedRendering is still buggedhackers and cheaters are rifenetcoding is basically just various forms of animal excrement sticky taped together with photocopied 1970 s pornography stapled to the messdevelopment team changes their promises and bans at a whimThe game is a meme  pass on it
The game only got buggier during the 3 months I ve played itBut the developers do no care about that instead of fixing horrifying bugs or the game s net code they spend their working time creating new costumes to sell for real moneyDon t buy this game Or try it to know what everyone s talking about and then refund it Don t give these LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s your money
Well this game is crackI just need one more gameyou have been warned
LOVE LOVE LOVE  this
U N O P T I M I Z E D
Buggy af but still good
Can t wait for optimization 10 fps ftwAMD a10 5800k8gb ddr3 ramAMD radion 6970
Before even coming close to fully polishing and optimizing   releases on xbox          turns out to be a disaster Optimization in terms of frames improve by quite a bit now a playable game BUT still crashes literally every other game essentiallyBug fixes hackers and plenty more still left uncontested   releases weapon skins Developers are money LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s to say the least cash grabs left and right not focused on the consumer having a good experience All in all Crash simulator
Better if you have friends to play with if you have no friends go and make some then come back and get this game
Terrible game Cancerous community runs terribly on ANY pc takes up wayyy to much time It is extremely overrated if you re thinking about purchasing it DON T BUY IT  You will hate the game after the first few hours and be extremely dissapointed in hoe the game runs its community and how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it actually is
Focus on finishing the game instead of offering payed content
Fun and exciting gameAlthough sometimes frustrating as you spend a lot of time looting only to get killed with one shot out of nowhereHas a lot of bugs but the developer is making frequent updates with a lot of fixes and improvements
I love this game yet I hate it so mcuh
Concepts and gameplay are awesome however still have major issues with  car physics Parachutes getting stuck Other than those 2 repeated issues the game is on its way to being one of the best shooters
Would not recommend this game until they fix alot of stuff Team matchmaking is bad 910 youll get someone without a mic and if you are a player with quite a few hours and high ranking youll get matched with someone with low ranking and 2 hours on random games Server is super laggy in the beginning of every game You can die from a random desync in around half your battles if you are playing aggressive There are quite a few videos online of people hitting shots but dying or a quick lag spike and instant death I have a 1080TI Ryzen 1800x and this game still runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on low settings More lag moments in this game than any other FPS I ve played It is still beta but has a long way to go
Overall it s a good game but there are still a few bugs I would like changed  I know it is still in alpha but it has been out for quite a while examples of these bugs could be  When trying to scope into your weapon close to a window then not only are you not scoped into your weapon but have this weird wide view of everything which I am personally not a fan of another bug  error I would like fixed is the weird frame drops randomly through the game I have quite a decent PC and have every setting except one on very low and these drops in FPS do not just happen to me so I assume this is game sidedHowever apart from these bugs I rate the game very highly
Sucks game
The game is currently drawing huge crowds
Game runs like a bag of mashed up a  holes stay away until its finished They also ban people for rediculous reasons
One of the best games so far
you are dead man if i have successful connected with server onceI think your server is worse than Ub
WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNERPros  Insanely fun to play  even more so with friends Great way to kill time  there are no competitive modes yet First Person Mode  because it creates more tension Fast Matchmaking Insane item prices in Steam Market  Sold my Ballistic mask for money then used it to buy Witcher 3  3Cons  Early Access  I was wary when buying this game because it s not yet  officially  released Bugs  Obviously this game has bugs and glitches hence the status  Early Access  Bluehole  The folks are great game developers but shtti game managers That s all I can say1110 would ask a friend for a loan to buy this game again xDPersonal Rant 
cmon then optimise it
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BUGED LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
You ve heard the news
sever suck always
Well what to say got my 100  solomatch  behind me  kinda bored of the game first few matches wowa kinda excited but now totale boredome something is missing  crates are kinda useless cauze no new optical gear what makes it worse the title  weekly randome crate   its always the same crates allweeks maybe it changes in future idkand guess what the cheaters and hackers make it no fun at all like in everygamepazifizim gets u mostly to top 10 kinda weird
Noice
   
Don t buy yet
Action packed fun to play with friends Definitely needs improvment  Early Access but when this game is fully released I could see it being one of the most popular games ever launched
Good game concept but the combat is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up in my opinion sometimes it works perfectly fine sometimes you are just oneshot or the enemy even though you have full euqipment  and sometimes enemies simply wont die even after 15 hits or u simply dont hit em even though you are clearly on point I dont recommend buying the game if i hadnt played more than 2 hours already i would have refunded but its too late now    I want my money back If you want to read more about the game just read the comments below this review forgot you can edit reviews
greatest game ever super fun if u like teaming  with friends and killen peps but even if u like soloing it great
In game main menu has been broken for over 2 months After weeks of trying to find an answer all i got was  I ts with the devs to fix  Absolute joke
best game 2017 is early access LUL
It s the same gameplay over and over It s buggy andI know it s an early release but right now not worth 30
Wtf i got banned and am unsure why  is this a permanent ban  did i just throw money away 
I d probably like this gameIF I COULD RUN IT
It s good game the best but the problem is the hacker and AFK killer
Hacking simulator 2k18Loot Manipulator 2k18Chinese rosetta stone
a great game the early access is coming along greatly
There is a plane in the game911 buy this game
Bull LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Chicken dinner10
dont buy this game nothing works proboly the guns are unbalanced and not shooting proboly and whit ervery updata there making this game worse and worse like the latest update who the hell need emots who fix the game and dont put useless feutures in god dame
Really fun game just like ur mama hahaha
Seeing PUBG getting from early access to a released version got my hopes up as the bugs in the beta version were pretty annoying but as it turns out the released version is way worse It has more bugs at least for me moders are still a problem and overall the devs don t listen to their community I regret paying 30 for that piece of u know what
im looking for peaple to play with anyone want to hit me up 
The game has potential However it s really not playable Far too many glitches still
overrated
It s a waiting game
Amazing game so tense and so much fun at the same time It s just a shame I am so rubbish at it
i can t run this game an error occurred while updating  app runninghaw can i fix this 
I love LOVE this gameBut they really need to region lock these damn servers Im tired of people coming into NA servers from other countries and making the game experience LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lag Oh and you know their ability to shoot through damn walls and teleport in and out of buildings It really makes us  my husband and I not want to play this game anymore And there has been ACTUAL harassment from these foreigners but since i cant see their names or who is talking i cant do anything about it Have had several gloating about being in a NA server just so they could get wins and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  things up for  American B itches  and wish they could kill us for real  not joking they actually said this So until the Devs get their heads out of their asses and stop messing with these damn  paying for cosmetics  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t and actually fix the game bugs and do what needs to be done with region locking i wont be playing this game very much If things get better i will change my review But as of now i will not recommend this game
Usually I m not salty but when I get 2nd placeI get really salty
Just don t
fun i guess I mean the times that the buildings actualy load in
top 7 teams and the game crashed  1010 POS
Great game especially with friends few bugs here and there but people forget its early access best battle royale game on steam
This game is fantastic it is better then its more cartoonish counterpart H1Z1 I don t know why people get upset about the microtransactions when it s only for cosmetic features and it goes to support the tournament  and or players Overall when they squash the bugs and optimize it a bit more it will be one of the best games on steam hands down
This game was the worst thing i think ive ever played lol
Good game need to fix some bugs
This is faced paced action with an engine that s the right level of detail If you want that crazy scanager rush of DayZ with the impending threat of other players and the ever shrinking safe zone this is the game for youI ve found duo to have the best squad play   and the first person mode is a must
Somehow this game has gotten worse performance wise Everytime i drop in the houses aren t loaded so i glitch through them Tab out of the game at your own risk it has crashed andor frozen the game for me about 50  of the time The lack of optimization makes this borderline unplayable for peeps with low mid range PCs I have issues on lowmedium settings on a rig that can run games such as Fallout 4 Killing Floor 2 7 Days to Die smoothly on max settingsSolo queueing for squad matches used to be incredibly fun but nowadays there are only 1 in 5 games where im playing with people who actually speak my languageOnce everything has loaded it can be a fun time but if you don t have a high end PC i d avoid this until you do Or maybe the devs will bother to optimize Pigs might flyEdit  Couple months later decided to give it another shot Halfway through the game my player froze solid2 minutes later got connection timed out 1010
Honked car got banned 911
region lock china plox
Feels so damn good to go home with a damn Chicken dinner
So bad
Good boy
This is for all the new people out their listen up This game is amazing if  you have ATLEAST  16GB RAMA GOOD STABLE HARD DRIVE NEWER CPU  I have Ryzen 1800x and at min a 4GB GPU otherwise you will have issues but please advise this game is worth doing to upgrades if you must have fun get that CHICKEN DINNER 
1010 would die outside of zone to get good loot again
YOU SHALL NOT PASS  the door1010
love it wish i got more then 30 fps but i have won like 50 times still would recommend 1010  3 3 3
Beautifull gameShould add ranked system so the game can be more competitive
    195000alluebat la taemal ladayaThe game does not work for me
Hard to recommend in its current state Not only is the game hard to run for  most people including my friends I also hear that all it takes to get banned is for someone to cuss or honk a car horn at a streamer Right Everything is so damn censored now a days to the point where you can t have any fun since someone will claim to feel offened and emotionally scarred Gameplay wise its a shame that low graphics settings give such a huge advantage The looting system lags and I feel that the hitboxes are a bit off Oh I know why ChInEsE pLaYeRs Please region lock them They account for 99  of the cheating in this games as stated by the man who created it and cause the lag in the game Id rate the game a 610 Beyond these things it is a fun game to play with friends I had said that I hoped some of these things improved upon version one release and they still have not been fixed
i think this game is super fun and rather dank 1011
As of this reveiw I don t reccomend this game It is very buggy glitchy unoptimised and hard to run I do understand it s in Early Access and will get better It is alot of fun and does have a steep learning curve Make sure you have a good graphics card and good cooling for it As for now I do love this game Personally I have alot of fun even though I have not won yet but it is still enjoyable Especially with friends its even better But I would wait for this game to get better and make a decision then I do also have to criticise Bluehole for saying they wouldn t add payed content but then later on adding it inAugust 31st 2017 Edit  Right now I think the game has gotten a bit better and I am enjoying it a lot better and am deciding to change my reccomendation I hope to see what they do in the future with the new map guns mechanicsDecember 18th 2017 Update  The game has been released on Xbox and I am sad to say there has not been much improvement to the PC version It is pretty much unplayable on console from what I have seen and I am dissappointed taht they decided to release it on console before even making the game beter on PC
Great game really addicting because you keep thinking I m gonna win the next one  and then don t and then play again I don t really have any critiques other than maybe a bigger variety of guns 
fun game give it a try ignore the negative microtransactions reviews they are just salty take it for what it is and enjoi
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game glitchy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fix this pile of turd
The game and the concept is greatI bought this a few months back because of the promises the developer made But just like politicians lie this developer lied and he chose to create a way to buy and sell clothing or  Crates  All in all if you tell us you re going to do something and then take a      on that promise well happy days Just like politicians doThe game in it self is fine and a huge success I enjoy playing it for the competitiveness and because I love winningBut simple based on the developers  Choice  Yes choice to make a tournement while the game is in Early access and riddled with bugs is beyond me In my head the developer has made alot of money and now aims for more shocker Money corruptsI understand some people chose to defend the game and feel mighty during so in their parents baseement but come on We deal with liars and cheaters everyday and while some get banned for joke reasons like  I was honking at a streamer  or whatever some people do get banned for cheating and wooI simply can t and won t endorse the game just like I m not voting for a politician who lies and runs away with the money
Very enjoyable
Over  n Under biotchhhh

Unless your a big time YouTuber or Streamer this game will not be focused around you Yes this is one of the best games I have ever played but I always find that there will be  Servers are to busy Please try again later  or  Connection Closed  and not just that  Lost Connection to Host  Personaly with a internet speed of 75mb download and 25mb upload also a ping of 5 to 10 at this current stage there sould not be any problem If you are thinking of live streaming this game like me and just starting out get a second rig like a check I5 laptop with a goood gpu because the coding they have used for this game will drop your FPS below 60 while streaming Just to give a base reason for a second rig mine is I7 7700k 2 1080gpu sli 32gb ram and not over heating to be the reason with a hydro twin fan water cooler and a 850w power supply to give it plenty of power So if you where to buy this game just wait till it comes out on xbox or ps4 and save yourself some hassle
If you don t put your user s gaming experience first optimize your product then good games can lose us
This is honestly the worst game I ve ever played
lovin it
Very Good Game To Play
Great idea for the game and I like the gameplay overall but it really runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Whole graphics on medium and im still running below 30 fps Every other game runs beautiful   arma 3 insurgency cs go day of infamy btut this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  So no I don t recommend right now
To PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS or not to PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS that is the question PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS  PUBG for short is an immersive imaginative and down right ingenious survival game and is absolutely worth your time and money I will now give you my unmatched expert high IQ opinion on whyPUBG overcomes the usual hurdle of boredom that is incestuous within this genre This is done by the wall mechanic or as I like to call it the Chad Cremator This wall comes honing in at regular time intervals and the Neaderthalithic Chads are not competent to move from the bathrooms they get stuck in While they were playing football and chasing girls I was studying the frying pan and eating chicken dinners This wall mechanic alone makes this game more interesting than anything similar on the marketThe downsides are that this game is Chads flavour of the month Seriously All you hear are Chads talking about the most recent sports game   Sigh  and Swedish kids shouting Kappa this and Kappa that all over the map while their sisters are swooning over my neckbeard and fashionable fedora This game is also sub sub sub sub optimized and cannot run on my potato laptop So I might as well knit my lovely Waifu a new sweater even though she always takes it off  the cheeky minx  All in all this game is with parting with your hard earned normie salaries if you can run it Go and show the Chads that the Incel army has arrivedREEEEEEEEE

Update update I hate it avoid it at all cost and go play Fortnite were the dev team listens to players and it always improving I hope this game dies like H1Z1
Pretty Good Game  
I like to go to school and learn important things like how to peek around corners
best 35 ever spent
is good game
Dear people who made this game you are by far the dumbest LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I have ever gotten to know that exist on this planet you make million of dollars but still incapable of making a actual good game You must surely have some braindamaged people in the office that runs that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  For whoever is looking to buy this game Dont It s a unfinished piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game with more bugs than a game from 1995
even though its rough around the edges as the early access label implies its absolutely worth playing and it s getting better  
fun Game
nsanlar servera balanamyor ama yapmclar oyuna kasa ekliyor early access oyunlara kasa ekleyen insanlardan bir ey beklemeyin
Great game overall when playing with friendsThe game shines when you play it as a co op strategy imo alone it can be almost boring810
This game is actually trash again How does it go from fixed to back to broken in such a quick moment  I have no idea but it did I adore this game in a sense for being such a good example of Battle Royale done right but when you not only begin charging microtransactions in an early access game let alone go back on your word about not doing it you don t deserve any more money Meanwhile the game is buggy and glitchy as hell Games crash frequently every patch brings a gamebreaking update in some way that doesn t get patched for a day and I ve played games where textures never fully loaded for a high of ten minutes meaning I couldn t loot let alone walk or see much since it lagged like hell And no I don t have a toaster  GTX 970 i7 6500U 8GB Ra A common fix is install PUBG on a flashdrive or SSD but I shouldn t have to do that to enjoy the game when they could optimize it properly     This worked for the time being if you still have issues running it
I would sugest to wait a bit It s poorly optimized and the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  buy it when they fix these problems
this game is such LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t needs tons of  work
basically h1z1 but this time it requires skill
The game is Improving bit by bit and lovin it
very very very bad like bad like bad bad dont buy it
Great game it s funny as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE lot of chinese trolling i like that person but sometimes chinese use cheat and that make me want uninstall this gameand fix the bug glitch or anythingThanks
This is fun and I mean VERY fun with a massive open world full of 100 players and a constant update community i give this game a big thumbs up with certain problems that may occur is only because the game is Early Accessand still this game has little bugs in it no matter what others say and if you disagree remeber this is EARLY ACCESS so dont be so corny over that and the game feels nice and is beloved by so many but reviews are people making small complaints or lies Dont listen to them for the game is amazing There is complications with the devs and how they ban peopel but there only doing it to make the game fair So buy it if not H1Z1 King of the Kill is a simular game made by the same devs but no longer being updated with wworse graphics as well Enjoy and ignore the haters
Game very fun and great with friends  Buy it for some fun and don t take it too seriously people going crazy over microtransactions Just spend your money where you want too
I got bored of winning Honestly I can see why this game is so popular Anyone can win a match honestly You can win with the slightest knowledge it s strange Eh it got boring after a while but It s still fun with friends now and again
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yeah
yeah  69 hours played so far yaaa
Team goes for air drop Friend asks for scope Team waits for friend Teammate gets killed Temmate slams headset down and walks away angry1010 Must buy
Great game most of the negative reviews are really reaching payed for crates are cosmetic only and a little too expensive for lackluster loot your chances of getting banned for  harrasing  a streamer are next to nothing long story short the game is great a ton of hours of gameplay for only 30 bucks and constant updates and improvements are awesome
THIS GAME IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ALREADY I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY HACKERS I HAVE SEEN IN EVERY GOD DAMN GAME   GPS AIMBOTS YOU NAME IT ITS THERE  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME
The game is buggy and crashes all the time and no matchmaking makes the game a clown fiesta would not reccomend
THIS GAME IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING INSANE this game does require some skill and also a good computer i dont think a i3 with a low end gpu would work i id try it out but with my pc i7 with 1070 runs perfectly do not mind the other comments it doesw say its early access so the game will have bugs in it not surprising at all so just ignore the hate this game gets its great but again has some flaus
 Sees PUBG on stream Looks really cool Buys PUBG thinking it ll be fun Gets into game loots for 30 minutes Runs for another 30 minutes Dies to guy prone in the grass Never shoots a single bullet
great game a lot of fun
This is my favorite game definetly recommend
Hackers   
Better than all Games  3 I love it so much   Thanks for making this Game
Dont waste your money on this roughly made piece of overhyped LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  those greedy Korean nitwits at Bluehole dont deserve it
it sucks
Came here to give this a thumbs up after seeing the negative reviews PUBG is some of the most fun I have had in more than 20 years of play PC Games I have played CS since the beta and PUBG reminds me of the fun I had as a kid in those first moments of discovering an FPS with your matesAll the negative reviews come from some strange sect of fundamentalist PCMR group who are all like  Boo hoo he broke a promise  Well wake up mate nobody is forcing you to buy the awesome yellow tracksuit pants or the dope purple skirt but if I had to choose between not paying for it and not having it and paying for it and having it I choose to invoke my rights as a capitalist pig and spend my hard earned cash on some fly digital sneakers so I can run around Erangel looking like a failed British rapper from the 90 sAnyway my first crate I opened and paid for a key I got a 15 pair of  digital sneakers so it seems you have a better chance of getting items than the disaster that is CSGO cratesHonestly for an EA game it is phenomenal and it isn t even that expensive compared to other AAA titles Let us just hope the developers don t lose their way
this game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sucks
I do like this game but you need a beast of a pc to play it Dont buy it unless you have a gtx 1080 ti with an i7 proccesor
Stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
Chinese hackers everywhere otherwise great game
Fortnites better
nice game ever
It is still in Early Access and I am writing this on the eighteenth of august 2017 It is extremely addictive and doesn t really have a  You diedlost so you get a penalty  It s just  Oh I died lets join another server Recently the servers have gotten REALLY bad laggy like they re being run on a Macbook Pro Though it is still fun and throw enough hardware and the lag on the servers gets fixed to a small extent
Great game But the devs should now prioritize their time and efforts on optimizing it
open bob good game
this is gud
Overall this is a very fun game to play alone or with friends but that doesnt mean there are not many bugsgliches and problems with this game such as the aweful graphic optimization and the fact that my game crashes 1 out 5 times I try to play not to mention that if your game doesnt crash before you get into a lobby you still have to deal with the various bugs and gliches this game is riddled with The fanbase for this game is already massive and thats because even though it has alot of glitches it is still a fun game I just hope PlayerUnknown fixes these issues before the games starts to lose players I will still give this game a thumbs up because it is still fun to play and at 30USD I find that a reasonable price I would recomend this game to a friend
This game is so overrated its laggy af the buildings load in like lego blocks and causes lag at inconvient times dont buy this game unless you have an expensive pc because its not optimized and runs exactly like arma 3
Frustrating exhilarating depressing and full of random derp moments definitely recommend for everyone
Feels like there is delay
Game keeps crashing for the last 30 min  Please fix this or I m asking for  refundGEFORCE GTX 180 ti
PUBG has grown to be my favorite game to play  Started off only watching streams and playing other games like CSGO but the streams convinced me to buy it and I could not be happier  Countless hours of never ending gameplay  I only wish the game was better optimized
                5      2           
This game is soo broken they got to fix it But the new map layout is pretty nice to be honest
manellis hacked the game we had a three man team with one enemy left with no other player in circle
Best game i have played in a long time looks like all the people moaning about it are people who stream snipe and don t have a good enough pc to run the game properly  
22
Very fun and well made game
Remove China and the game is good
This game should be removed from steam it s the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE est game ive ever played
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game it doesnt work to my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing awesome pc
This game is spectacular Even in its current unfinished state the game provides hours of fun and heart pounding action The gunplay is smooth the turrain is harsh and the feeling of suspense makes the player feel alive while knowing the fact that they could be killed at any given moment by anything or anyone One of my favorite games ever can not recommend this enough
stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE  devs
Even though I m almost at 400 hours played I still do NOT recommend this gamePUBG has a nack for doing absolutely nothing the community has askedWE DONT GIVE A      ABOUT WEAPON SKINSGive us map selection optimization and region locking Get it right or else this game will be dead in 2019
Really great game 
1010 would drop on school again
I played 10 hours so far no were near as much as others and this review comes from the point of view of somone who dies and never makes it to the top ten lol but its so much fun and i love this game
LandLootDieRepeat
rubbish game always server busy can not in game
The benchmark of all Battle Royale games
grrrr
My squad plays around by playing boat jousting or playing hot potato with a frag and we usually have better chances of winning than we do taking the game seriously1010 would kill for chicken dinners again
Devs need to stop banning people for reasonable LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Like seriously banning people for honking the horn that you guys put in the game is unreal Good game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  banning staff
i do enjoy the game but in its current state i would not recommend it theres a lot of network lag and the devs started releasing payed for cosmetics which was one of the things they said they would avoid until the full release of the game This is concerning because typically devs will start to focus primarily on skins and less on bringing the game closer to full release  turning the game into a microtransaction money farm Theres also a bug where you will lag out for almost half a second when you get shot which will often lead to you dying The looting system is pretty far from perfect as well
Well then PUBG personally i found about this game by youtube streamers and once i saw it i knew i had to get it I also read a review that said stream sniping bans are disgustingWell dear friend i need to tell you to understand that         targeting people just because they stream is not fair to the streamer to they ban people for it Not all streamers are good at this game If you liked a streamer who played this game and they were in your match and you targeted them and killed them for just being in your game Would that be fair Yes I do understand that this is a early access game and that it has bugs But i personally love itSo I hope if you buy this game you will like it too
I very much like this type of gameplay
Great game great concept still laggy cause early acces pumped for full game and custom modes
Best game
I genuinely enjoy playing a couple rounds on pubg but I m one of those people who get tired of playing after a couple of rounds But neither the less the game has great mechanics and it s definitely enjoyable to play with friends In my opinion though this game wasn t worth my 37 dollars but I still do not regret my purchase considering this is still a WIP game I ll be looking forward to the future updates and its official release
Great game just crying for new maps cuz recent one gets boring really fast
NOTE  1 Do not buy PC if you do not have a graphics card with at least 2 GB VRAM and a decent processor  you need a decent gaming PC for a smooth experience  I have an i5 6600 33ghz and a GTX 970 4GB and run the game well2 Devs have their ups and downs many factors to consider when reading other reviews3 TONS of games have microtransactions including CS GO which receives overwhelmingly positive reviews Don t listen to the negative reviews about micro transactions if that doesn t affect you You re probably here to buy the game for the gameplay anywayPoint of discussion 1  The game is not very optimized which is a given with the game being  EARLY ACCESS  Unless you have a PC that matches the minimum recommended specs you SHOULD NOT buy this game and instead should invest in a new PC or wait for more optimization patches The game has become smoother and runs much better than it did when it first came out already so there s no way to say it won t keep improving performance wise Keep in mind that many people will downvote the game because they can t run it and call it  poor optimization  A bad PC won t run a new game in 2017 that s a factPoint of discussion 2  The devs have been VERY transparent so far on updates and up until recently their updates have stuck to weekly and monthly patches on a schedule that have consistently improved the gameplay and performance of servers and clients They post updates to their twitter PUBATTLEGROUNDS for example and tweets are released for any delays or patch timings The devs have delayed patches before but for the most part they are honest about release times for patches and tell us exactly what to expect and when to expect itThe biggest problem with the game at the moment is that they have recently scrapped the weeklymonthly update system after almost 5 months This may mean that development has slowed or that it has become a harder task for them and requires more time Actually I lied The biggest complaint from most people right now is the micro transactions which were specifically stated wouldn t be in the game They have 2 free crates and 1 crate that requires a key for 250 While I understand that they went against their word on this which is justification for anger toward Bluehole most games already have microtransactions and they have become a common money grab for most titles It is not that big of a deal If you don t want to pay for crates don tOverall the devs seem to be mostly honest with the community about when and what is going to happen through social media such as twitter and appear to be trustworthy with keeping us updated about every change that will happen in the futurePoint of discussion 3  GameplayI ll keep this TL DR for the sake of not having a 5000 character review 1 Crate loot is worth the risk but is not overpowered to the point that it guarantees victories2 Guns feel smooth and responsive takes skill and practice to control and master3 RNG is a huge factor in the game that changes your experience in gameplay almost every game  ie different scope no sniper no meds no boosters no car across the map from circle4 Gunfights are thrilling and require tactical gameplay such as smokes grenades flanks and hitting shots5 Servers can have problems after patches but are usually resolved within the first 24 hrs of new patch6 Game is improving with every update7 It is a FUN GAME especially with your friends in a squad of 4  I personally don t have fun playing solos thoughOverall I recommend this game to anyone with a G O O D  P C that wants a game to enjoy with their F R I E N D S8510
One Punch Head shot  u

Rendering simulator
Best game 2017
its fun a combination of skill and luck and winning a game is satisfying
cant launch my gamedont tell me to this or that i already did it dammit fix my damn game or just give me my money back
is alrite
Really is an over hyped piece of trash Every game mechanic from shooting jumping and driving is done poorly making the gameplay atrocius But you ll still play it anyway because all your friends do
Cant recommend it makes me cringe how bad the game runs its been out longer than any other game in early access and still out of early access cant even make the game run good enought to say its  finished  Hitboxes are worse than how the game runs my final review   210
Fun game but much lagg so i hope it will get improved
So after several hundred hours I can finally leave a honest review about this gameI m still slightly miffed about the devs not following through with the agreement of no microtransactions duiring EA but that aside I very much enjoy PUBGWith each initial startdrop and lootspawn being different there is a huge RNG element to the game   but that s pretty much every game at this point I understand it needs to be part of it and I won t let it sway my opinion They ve come a long way since I started playing PUBG A new map new mechanics weapons bugfixes etc etc They ve come much further than other devs Not without mistakes mind you   such as the streamsniping banwave etc but that s expected It happens   we make mistakes and move onThe gameplay has become a lot more reliable Less and less am I being trapped in random objects unable to detatch my parachute flung from houses instantly killed I like the direction it has gone in and the developers work to improvce the game where possibleIt s enjoyable and the RNG means it s addictive You don t know how each round will go Once you ve got decent loot you have a chance to show your skills and capabilities   it s not all just RNG There s one thing that they still haven t 100  fixed and that will be because it s not an easy mechanic to just  fix  and that s vehicles I m still being flung around flipping over 8 times from a small bump at 20 KMh etc All in all it s good fun has variance but there is still room to improve I m hoping I get to see that happen
sobrang saya yong game na to bili na kayo guys xD
Could be a good game of its genre if dev focus more on actually developing the game rather than think of ways to milk the players money
This is just a good game
REGION LOCK CHINA                         _       REGION LOCK CHINA
The game was good itself Always remember CHINA NAMBAWAN
DISCLAIMER  This review is based off my experience for the first 3 hours It can change the more hours I put into itPLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a game I never paid attention to when it first got released in March I was more into playing games like Valve s Counter Strike  Global Offensive and Blizzard s Overwatch But most of my hours were spent in playing Elite  Dangerous which is still my main game But August 15th I decided to pick up a pre loaded card for 32 and I bought PUBG And what do I think in short  A awesome game with potentialTo begin with PUBG is a Battle Royale game If you ve read or watched the Hunger Games or played similar games like H1Z1 or sigh Minecraft s  Hunger Games  mode you ll know what to expect But if you aren t familar with these types of games in short it s a all out battle for life and death You have to collect armor and supplies to stay alive and weapons to defend your self That s simply put Everyone is your enemy unless you are playing duos or squads which let you work as a team with your friendThe gameplay is in my opinion well polished there aren t any broken game mechanics from what I have played through Everything is straight forward from looting items to opening doors it s all very smooth The graphics are impressive and the performance I get whilst running at ultra settings are 60 and above  I have a 6 core i7 and a GTX 1070 There s a lot to this game that I can t all put into a review you just need to watch videos yourself or take a chance and get it I was skeptical about this game like I was for CS GO and OW but after playing it for a bit it s an awesome gameIf you can take the 30 pricetag I would recommend to buy it The developer s are doing a great job with all of the updates and it has a lot of potential Or you could wait for the nearest sale and grab it Trust me it s worth it
Best sand box out there
BUY ITTTT
Very good yesyes you run you smash you shoot you scream out of rage when some random stupid motherfu  er smashes you with a shotgun  yes yesvery good
Mmhm where to start When I first bought this game I wasn t really passionate into it and didn t give much care The only reason I bought PUBG was because of how much attention it got but I was mainly playing CSGO so I didn t bother playing much However when I started getting better at the game I thought Holy Sh t this is pretty good I gave PUBG more attention until my friends eventually bought the game This is where the fun started I was fully into PUBG I swapped over from CSGO to PUBG but as everything the more experience you have with something the more flaws you find I have eventually gained enough hours to confidently write a review And so  PROS Great attention to detail  Scopes attachments bullet drop map scaling zeroing with weapon scopes etcEasy to learn controlsAlways updated devs  Always working on bringing out new content and fixing bugsVery competitive  Don t expect PUBG to die anytime soonNot too high level gapHackers are always dealt with  Once you see a hacker and report him he is gone for goodSuper satifying feeling when winning a gameInternet is not as a big factor  Where you could play in EU or Asia whilst in OCE and still have a good fighting chanceThe game is only at the early stages of its full release  PUBG as of now will only get betterFriends completely help and change the PUBG game  PUBG is 120  better and more fun with friendsYou can make a few bucks from PUBG  The more you play the more points you get With these points you could buy crates and open them or you could sell them for steam bucks As of now I have made 50 bucks just playing off PUBGCONS Game breaking bugs everywhere  Vehicles exploding randomly 2 bugs found in school where you could peak through the walls and even shoot enemies getting stuck randomly looting glitches etcDevs prioritise the wrong updates  Where they release new content without fixing the fundamentals of the gameBeast PC to run at constant high FPS  I have an i5 8gb RAM GTX 1060However I have the game set to VERY LOW as if I go higher such as high I achieve a good 80 fps but always stutters down to 20 fps every few seconds which essentially makes the game unplayable Probably due to RAMSh tty servers  I really mean it I have had the dumb main menu tell me how the servers are too busy and that I had to reconnect A few times it took me almost 8 minutes just to get into a dumb gameNo map picker  PUBG now has 2 maps however I feel like the latest map is not my style and compared to the first one I dislike it The devs however did not implement a map picker into the game and you are stuck in the inevitable void of wishing you get your preferred mapConclusion There are more PROS and CONS of which I have probably not listed but these are the ones which are most significant in the back of my head I could imagine PUBG as a really cool looking friend but the more you know her the more b tch slaps she increasingly gives you It has so much potential and I still am positive about PUBG but I have my faith in BlueHole and hopefully it will only get better from here onPS I absolutely suck and hate Fortnite but it s because I still haven t had much experience with it and I definitely recommend PUBG over Fortnite IMO
Hey do you want an unfun rage inducing bug filled LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  overpriced game with inconsistant weapons  You ve came to the right gameDo you want to be killed by asian hackers only to be called an xenophobe when you ask for a region lock PUBG is the game for you Now you can shoot someone with a level 1 vest 10 times  with a UMP only for them to 1 shot you with a Mini 14 Don t buy this game
I like the game and continually will support it however I highly go against condoning microtransactions especially the crate system that s been popping up recently Otherwise it s a decent game to play and I d only recommend to pay 20 dollars if possible
I never thought I d like a Battle Royale gameBut I was wrongThis game gives you all that you wantFUNI don t know what it is but there is something in this game that makes me keep coming backMaybe it s the ambiguity of knowledge about the presence of your enemies and suddenly realizing that they re right in fron of youHow you re gonna take them down what you re going to do next It s a STRAIGHT YES from me
PUBG is the best bad game i ve played in a while A big clunky buggy unpolished turd but it s still engaging to playHas pay to open crates with exclusive marketable cosmetics   microtransactions and market bullshttery in early access already this is gaming industry of today
I know they run on different engines but when games like Metal Gear Solid 5 run on high graphics flawlessly with almost no frame drops on my system I find it intensely unsatisfying that a game like PUBG suffers from massive frame drops with textures failing to load and unbearably long loadtimes that are so long that by the time I get into the game the airplane is already halfway across the map I have to question why this game has the balls to even do a cratekey microtransaction systemIn my opinion the most important part of a multiplayer experience is optimization and compatibility Games like Overwatch Rainbow 6 Counter Strike they are all amazingly compatible with a multitude of systems When people play games with a competitive nature the last thing they want to worry about is falling through the building when the building  they were attempting to land on failed to load in timeAnd before you ask yes I am intending on eventually upgrading my computer s graphics card amongst other things but it isn t currently on my top list of priorities I heard a lot of good things about PUBG a lot of my favourite Youtubers have played it and it looks very enjoyable when it runs right I was fortunate enough to have a halfway decent match in this game before I decided it was not woth it right now But PUBG has a lot of problems that they need to fix before I ll ever look into getting it again
I like walking
The game is okay But I m not as good as the hackers so I can t win
Has such big problems with lagging in and out of the inventory 3 times today been killed while looting because i couldnt get out the the inventory screen
This game is great compared to h1z1NO plug Less BUGS and It s a really balanced game
Great game The most fun I ve had in a gameAll the negative reviews even say its a great game but they are mad at the devs for testing the crate system a few months before the game is released THIS IS WHY WE CAN T HAVE NICE THINGSLike come on people why would you want them to test the crate system after launch  The game is EA this is WHEN YOU TEST THINGS
uh 
Rubberbanding occurs everywhere in this game
love this game it is soo good but there should be a open world free play game mode with out the cirle for playable area gettting smaller but apart from that i love it
Buggy laggy heavily luck based Until they fix one don t bother playing more frustrating than fun
Its kinda good and it kinda sucks I think It has a lot of potential but the current gameplay does get a little stale after a while So much looking at the floor so much getting sniped so much driving so much finding cool stuff and never getting to use it
Would be an ok game if not for the incredible amount of hackers ALso mic spammers made my head hurt Play fortnite its tons better
Hi Hi you Yes you over there Are you really bored with Fortnite and other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Last man standing  games  You are  Then I have some good news for you This game is perhaps the best  Last man standing  game you and your friends can find on Steam right nowBtw Dont play Fortnite
ddd
  
Awesome game love that they added cases greeat addition to an already awesome game keep up the good work
Way too much hype  Graphics are not the best movement is not smooth at all  Overpriced for what you get  Wait for a LOT more to be done before purchasing
I got 2nd place once and I probably never will againAlso Mom s spaghetti1010
Hackers bugs and lag galore The performance of this game engine only gets slightly better each patch and yet continues to get worse as time goes on
Super Fun Game
Good Game I like it  D
It s Battle RoyaleHunger Games gameplay is addictive scary and thrilling No experience is the same Highly reccomend duos or squads but solo can have its good moments Could do with better optimisation
1010 Game it made me kill alot of people
It s really good but not well optimaizdplz optimaiz
spectator simulator 2015
I ll give you the short and sweet version of my reviewGreat game improving steadily Bugs are present but nothing game breaking that I ve experiencedEven if you re terrible at the game  myself included it still manages to be fun more so when playing with a partnerteam
30100 Overhyped game
Jumped out of the plane parachuted onto the ground Another person landed in the same area i chased him for 2 minutes and then beat him to death with my fists 1010
This game is so boring
I d love to say something positive about the game there are so many things Yet I ve come here today to bash the microtransactions That was shady  AF  Limited time and very sketchy about informing you it costs real money so you get the crate and find out it costs 250 to open Ooo that s tricky bs there That kind of middle finger to the customer puts me way on the backburner for recomending this game I hear they lied about not doing that to start with then I see them turn right around and do it in a vile money grubbing manner Not cool There goes your positive ratings
Best battle royal game out there in my opinionIf u like battle royal games then I absolutely recommend this game
It s not as bad as the reviews suggest Yeah they released paid cosmetic crates early and there are loads of  hilarious bugs but it is fun Imo that s all that matters
Quite fun with friends buttclenching aloneNever stand still or your head will explode from a Kar98k shot
Ignore all the recent negative reviews The microtransactions do not affect the gameplay at all and the proceeds are going to a good cause The game is fantastic both solo and with friends Although the game can be buggy sometimes you got to remember it is still early access The game is updated and improved on a monthly basis and is not far away from a full releaseI ve never played a game so tense in my life Had many a mini heart attack playing this game The plane drop and the circle been different and random each time makes for an enjoyable and new experience every time you play a round causing you to apply different tactics and approaches each game1010 would recommend 
Everyone is claiming the game is terrible because of micro transactions the thing is the crates ARE COSMETIC ONLY theres no weapons and no armors and such A friend and I have had a blast playing this game I recommend this game to anymore who likes battle royale games
amazing game when your not a scrub
I really wanted to write a review on this game like  it was so good i didn t masturbate for a week  or  the gameplay is so good i didnt want to go outside But instead this is what i have to say THIS IS MY OPINION YOURS MAY DIFFERFor people who want to buy this game  Optimisation  This is been aweful since the beginning its a fine balance of keeping everyone happy improvements to carsbuildingseffects has been updated a few times But none to which i can see You can sit at 100 fps one moment and suddenly 40 30 20fps for a moment Lobby s  These ARE toxic no doubt about it you can unmute all chat for 3 seconds before someone is yelling the  N  word or cussing somebodys mother Furthermore the ammount of OBVIOUS under 18 s playing this game is unfathomable with thier whiney pre pubescent screechy  PICK ME UPPP IM DYYYYYYINGGGG  FPS  Many many D Syncs  and lagspikes are in effect in this game nomatter if your on Ryzen or a noice i7 7700k using a lovely little 4gb gfx card This is just a ball punch to the  e sports ready  vibe it has going on since day 1 Hackers  Yes There are alot of players even just 1  of them hacking is ALOT usually using ESP or some sort of AIMBOT And you WILL run into one at some point usually followed by a bunch of chinese jibberish     not all are chinese but its 95  of the time bro Vehicles   In this instance  Tricycles motorcycles you can drive down a straight road doing 50kph and suddenly get shot 100 feet in the air for NO reason  other vehicle glitches can be easily found on youtubeThere we go theres all the bad points out of the way now for the good points Lots of guns  continually reviewed and nerfed as all fps games do throughout thier life IMO  Snipers are a good choice along with a nice assault rifle however there are tonnes of combonations Communication  Instantly you want to  mute lobby  or atleast set it to  Team Only  The Ammount of racist kids on this is insane However if you do manage to find a decent group you then have to  get on the same page  in a pretty short ammount of time this may add to the intensity in team mode for a little bit more  pro  gameplay use discord and try to find a team you can  gel  withOverall 7510 EZ 9510 if bluehole spent  some  of the money from cratesskins to better optimise and give the PLAYERS what they wantSo would i reccommend this game  Yes merely because when you make it to the top 10 you can feel your heart Trust me on this one
One of the best games i ve ever played
Good Game So many complaing babies say how there is optional skins you have to pay for   wahhhh I dont get to have something wahhh   so many entiltled people complaing and leaving a negitive review an issue I heard is people getting banned honking near a streamer it being called harrasement actually complain about something that affects the game and not compleltly optional and unrelated to actual gameplay
one of the best game i ve ever played dont start playing because you cant stop
Loved this game to death and I won t be purchasing another copy or recommending this game until I get unbannedLiterally going against a few players that were apparently streamers  Stone valley or something stupid like that a buddy of mine in my group told me So I decided to attack them with a car while yelling  BEEP BEEP MOTHER F UCKERS  Killing him and his buddy Ever since I have been banned for harassment like wtf  So I spent 30 euros on a game and risk potential ban for a little horse play its not Like I was constantly going at them or saying racial slurs etc Really dumbEdit Going to keep the review negative but I got unbanned  3 Could be because of my review and it gaining tension but still was unjustified and ignorant reason for banning me for a little horse playI didn  exploit anything if honking the car horn and yelling  Beep Beep Mother LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er  to a streamer gets me banned that s extremely dumb They should definitely start looking into a better system instead of craddeling streamers ballsEdit again  Apparently I was banned for stream snipping I was in a game with a well known streamer  Rock or Stone valley  Something on those lines It was a group game and I was the only one alive and my friends were dead and by chance 1 of my friends was watching the streamer and realized I was in their game as when I killed someone my name popped up in the recent kills So he told me and me knowing well that I wasn t going to survive much longer with a shotgun and pistol with no health or armour got into a vehicle and charged straight at them while having my mic turned on  Intentionally  while honking and yelling into the mic   BEEP BEEP MOTHELOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ERS  I instantly killed both of them they were behind a couple of bushesI got banned reason was for harrasment and there was no timer indicating a suspensionTried contacing the developers with no response to this dayTo clear things up for whom ever reads this review I still strongly believe I did not deserve a ban or any punishment really as it was mere horseplay and just having fun
Running it on a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  box  graphics card and it runs smooth ish at around 40 50 FPS but keep in mind I m using a 650 ti boost which is beyond old and garbage other than the occasional lay it s Hella fun and was defs worth the money as long as they continue to improve the game and I upgrade to my 1050 it ll be he best
Amazing game  Hard as hell  This game will keep you entertained for hours
Ran over 5 people in one game with a car 1010
Ridiculously addictive game there are a number of fixes that need to be made which seem to generally get fixed1010 would play again
This game is fun and actually addicting once you get into it but the none recommendation is from the lies told to us directly from a resource page for the offical PUBG website Instead of working on the servers to fix the issues of hit detection loot spawn lag loot table spawn clunky vehicles that are more of a death trap when taken off road and countless other issues us  early access  players have been enduring just to support Bluehole they introduce microtransactions to the gameFigures on their sales show that they made over 100m with sales and can clearly fund their  tournament  that they re going on about All proceeds are going to Gamers  Outreach Program and that s all fine and dandy but why do you need more money from people that are supporting your game to fund this tournament when you clearly have more then enough in sales to cover costs to create said tournament  It s not like it s a damn super bowl with celebraties showing up for half time you need to payEvery announcement Bluehole makes is pretty much a step back from a previous commitment that they stated in an earlier interview or FAQ draft They say with great determination that this won t happen then mention they might think about it but not really act upon it until later and then they go full 180 on you These guys are like politicians and I wouldn t be surprised if they had a few of them adding in their 2 cents on the gameI do NOT recommend this game due to Bluehole being untrustworthy and unable to uphold their commitments they promised to us gamers If we do not make our voices heard and do something then what is keeping developers from being greedy just for a quick cash grab  Make the devs listen to us so games are actually created with gamers  enjoyment in mind instead of our money
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME   YETThis is not yet a 30 game  I am getting a lot of early game stuttering and lagging and the buildings take minutes to load once I am already on the ground  Which means that other players have a few minutes head start to load up and come and murder my lagging LOVE LOVE LOVE   This game has a lot of potential but it is so far unrealized  Wait until optimization issues are ironed out before buying this game
Good Game But Need Bigger Server ASAP
It s awesome
Great game to play with friends Althought the game can get very annoying when you loot for 20 minutes and then just run into a camping guy To be honest i ve gotten so mad at the game sometimes because of that so i rarely enjoy it anymore Don t get me wrong its absolutely awesome when you get great stuff and get to the fair gunfights Side is that you can actually earn some money out of the game by selling the crates you can acquire with battle points
Pretty fun though I only got it recently and haven t played too much of it Like most multiplayer games luck is a huge factor but if you can get over that you can get a kick out of it
Spawns in hacker teleports self to ground and turns on aim bot punches everyone dies 1010 IGN
Almost 200h in the gameBelieve me i have I seen a lot of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE So lets start best Battle Royalegreat mechanics gunsmovement etcwell sized mapa lot of teamwork envolved to win in squads or duoin general the game is very good bugs and banning people for finding them just dont kill a stremer you will be banned cz of   stream sniping  ofc microtransactions in an early acess cmmon dont be like valve and btw the loot is worst than cs go unoptimized i play at very low at 80 90 fps  i have a 980 and i 7 4 me looting is very bad i loot 5 buildings and i find all types of pistols  in poLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i JUST WAIT TO RELEASE
    UPDATE 06022018    Chinese hackers are ruining your game Fortnite never has these issues What s your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing excuse  I can t wait until a real company develops a new battle royale These issues have been going on for over a year H
cancer but fun at the same time
After 15 minutes looting you finally get in to action And at that moment you realise that you don t know how the weapons react Would have been  nice if there was a training mode or shooting rage so you can get used to the weapons instead of having to figure that out in combat Yeh ok at the start of the game  lobby there are weapons to try but not with all the extensions  scopes foregrips silencers ect  This game made me ragequit a couple of times already I hope they soon come with  Damage report system that tells where you hit him or he hit you how much dmg it did and what he was wearing And ofcourse after you die you have the option to see his point of view so for now after all the frustrating moments that i have encouterd so far i do not recommend it unless you do like to ragequit and cry in a cornerEraZer out  ragequit

This would be one of the best fps that I seen in a while  I like the concept of looting your gear and imangining that these people are being dropped on an island  or two in hopes of acheiving a grand prizeThe concept seems to be very similar to Hunger GamesGraphics   There is various settings for graphics  It can go from simple to way complex  If you want a good looking game you can do that but at a sacrifice  The  fairness  between higher graphic settings is different than those with lower graphic settings  The higher the settings the harder it is to see opponents  especially from afar  The lower the settings and you can see opponents trying to hide in places they think is covered in foliage  So in other words you want better graphics then you must make a sacrifice3rd person pov   Obviously with any 3rd person shooter people are going to try to peek around corners without having to reveal themselves to the enemy  But I tend to favor this kind of gameplay anyway for the reason that too much is being revealed when peeking normally anyway or others have an uncanny knack of killing you while taking a quick peak  which to me is unreal if someone takes a quick peak and gets killed while doing it1st person pov   Lots of people favor this mode  I don t for the reason above  I also like to know if my toon is fully behind cover  This view has dedicated servers now with the latest update  Beware some people may get  queezy  as there is a small motion while you run  which you do oftenBoth views look good though and have pretty good and consistent frame ratesA few drawbacks1  Looting can get tiresome  You may need to be an action junky to get over this so you can loot others when you kill them to save you some time and trouble with this aspect2  Physics for vehicles are a little off  You could be driving down a perfectly good looking road and suddenly your car will flip around as if you hit a ramp or an object  Doesn t happen often but when you just got a crate this might LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you off pretty severly3  There is no rankings in which to matched with  A match consists of the first 100 people that are in que4  Simple graphics will allow you to see opponents that probably would not be seen with better graphics5  Dev s are kind of sticklers with  rules  of the game  Put a car horn in the game and you may be banned if someone finds it irratating to themI don t know why they put them in in the first place6  There are a few glitches that can happen  And if utilized you may find a ban hammer on you  So if the walls of a building aren t fully rendered in don t go killing the people that you see that are running around in them7  Game is focused on longer ranged fights  The delay it takes to have shots register willmay get you a bit urkled  So close range is pretty much anyone s ballgame8  Headshots are too many  No resembelance of real life  About 13 of the kills  if not better will be done with headshotsGood things 1  Concepts are pretty darn good  Everyone enters in the same manner  Its all strategy and skill when the plane starts flying over the island for you to be dropped2  Crate system in place for new weapons  This is good because this allows weapons to be  tested  without actually having to use a dedicated server3  Various weapons with ammo4  Various equipment to gather  Helmet vest and panlolOverall I give this game a rating of 90 out of 100PS   Strong suggestion would be not to spend actual money for ingame stuff  If you are looking for a specific outfit odds are very much against you  I opened 50 crates and never got a rare item yet  So stay with the free crates as you may find yourself spending quite a few dollars to actually getting lucky  And if you wish to take a shortcut to get them you must spend real life money on the steam community sales to get them  And that might be very expensive  Check it out by following the tabs  community market PlayerUnknown s BattleGrounds  scroll down to find it   This is where you can see how  expensive  it might be for you to get something special  If I knew this I wouldn t have bothered spending the money and have learned a lesson in regards to this hint   some items go for 500 US     041718 added    This game is changing to gear more for the action junkies who want nothing but action  This means that the stealth individual will lose a lot of his ability to stealth around  They are heavily geared to making the game an Esport type game  This means that at current they are follying around with the time it takes for circles to change  faster and close  faster  For example a game might take 40 minutes to play has now been reduced to almost less than 30 minutes  Also the blue zone goes faster than you can run even in the later stages of the game  They are still tweeking all thisWith other games going for battle royal modes I would advise that you hold on to your money and wait for them  Unless you are going to be competing for something real or are general a pro with shooting that doesn t rely on stealth I would recommend you wait for another game to get popular Overall the developers of this game weren t planning on the long term of the game  And with all the battle royal games coming out soon they really needed to get their stuff together and get added content into the game along with any fixes it needed  Instead they added in their own latency effect made one map  2 more coming and a bunch of cosmetic items that are horribly expensive to get
Dont worry about all the negative reviews saying dont buy the game because of microtransactions that has no impact on the gameplay at all yes there are bugs its in early access so it s to be expected buy the game for your self and see dont let the negative reviews stop you and if you look at all the negitive reviews that are telling you to not buy the game its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you just look at there hours go up and up
Great game to play with friends and its good to play while bored make me laugh so hard1010

This game gives you cancer
People who complain about micro transactions are dumb The game is amazing Very fun I literally dont understand why people have a problem the company is not forcing you to buy cosmetic items And you can still unlock free crates with lots of rare items just by playing the game Keep up the good work
A very tense and fun game to play with friends and loved ones by your side
Adding microtransactions in a  Early Access  game is the most blatant money grab in recent history  But its to test the keys  Goyim  Yeah not even a 5 year old would believe this statement Game is fun greedy developer is ruining it Atleast control your greed till you have released your game
This game is the best battle royal game ever made
Microtransactions in early access please fck off
YE
Stop microtrasactions for full price games
this game is amazing people are talking about the microtransactions it is litterly one crate and it is all cosmetics and yes i know the developer went back on his word but it is still a great game so buy it  u will be glad you did
not bad at all

Walking Simulator  teleporting enemies  asian hackers kys
Update to my original review  which was positive My original review was done with the hopes that the developers would get their stride following their overwhelming success I hoped they would prioritize the bugs and hackers Instead they implemented fog added a new weapon and thats itIn the time I ve owned this game BlueBalls has become a 4B company and their development speed has slowed to a snail s paceThis is quickly turning into a prime example of why early access screws the consumer Pubg is as popular now as it will ever be   the amount of money that BlueBalls stands to make off Pubg by releasing it fully will be miniscule compared to what they could make if they say made another game and just leave pubg to rotI have been sorely disappointed with the development of this game Optimization is terrible there are so many bugs that you can go on youtube and find thousands of hilarious videos of people finding bugs in the game Hackers my god In the past month alone BlueBalls has banned an excess of 300000 accounts Let that sink in They have banned that many people and it still is completely unplayable from hackers This coming from a game that wants to become an esport lmfao I ve consistently ranked top 1000 in every ladder since the ladder systems first were implemented The hacking has never been worse than it is now Prior to about a month and a half ago I never accused anyone of cheating Now I can t go a single game without feeling like I was screwed because of a hackerDon t worry guys vault will MAYBE be in the game before releaseToo bad the servers will be empty cause people don t have time to deal with bugs and hackers waiting for a feature that should have been implemented 2 months agoPositives   A ton of fun to play with your friends  seriously the option to not queue with randoms in a competitive game and play at a disadvantage is something that every competitive game should consider  Lots of replayability  Twitch was fun to watchCons   Sells itself as a competitive game when you literally can t play two games in a row without running into a hacker  Months after release simple bugs are still in the game For example it took them a full month to fix the bug where NA players defaulted to Asia servers at the main menu  Cross continent gameplay  hackers galore  Every other game is either fog or rain What this means is that a game where there are 100 people before the first bullet is fired there will be less than 60 people in the game  because everyone leaves these games  Vehicle mechanics are hilariously bad  Armor needs to be normalized or removed entirely There will be game after game where you literally stop shooting people because you assume they can t possibly still be alive and then they shoot you in the back  Shotguns are completely unreliable   half the time I will shoot someone from 50 feet away and kill them instantly The other half of the time I will point blank someone in the throat and there will be zero hit recognition  The game is an FPS yet its shooting system is mediocre at best   flat out unplayable at worst  The garbage servers I won t even  Early access cash grabOld Review For the love of God   when is a AAA company going to make one of these games  Is the game fun      YeaShould you buy it to play with friends      Yea Is the combat garbage      AbsolutelyAre the servers complete dog sh t      Every dayWill half of your deaths be completely bogus with no rhyme or reason as to why you died     Yep
the game its salf is not bad bad the aiming is so hard thet i miss with shotgun  meaby bacause the aim is not like cs or rianbow six siage so my point is thet the aiming is not like athor fps shoters
But it s kinda Charity isn t it  I heard that they re gonna use for a  E Sprots  thingyyyyyeven though still it s a nice game
the amount of people jumping on the hate train for this game makes the trains in india look normal
The only updates this game recieves daily We are investigating server connection issues  Thank you for being patient with us as we get the game up and running as soon as possible
      UPDATE 10 RELEASE      Hacker every other game They dont aim down sights and insta lock onto your head track you through walls and snipe you from no where This game isnt fun anymore
as soon as the paid content showed up the server lag and server crashes came with it Using the money from mandatory keys to open crates to fund a prize pool instead of funding server connectivity and game development  Shameful
skits m8
It isnt acceptable that a none released game should ever have any sort of paid content till release Until that is removed have my no recommendation
Do they do refunds by any chance lol my computer cant run it and it was 30 Online it said i could run it but it takes too long to load and i lag when im in a car
Almost returned the game Played some more due to friends and favorite streamers and fell in love 100 hours in 3 weeks
Add loot boxes   weapon skins rather than optimizing assets in the game or fixing bugs OR cracking down on the problem with the amount of hackersDon t support the developer Don t buy this game
Player unknown battle grounds is a very fun and  frustrating game but blue hole don t care they add weapon skins but the true issue is bugs and some gun mechanics I would buy this game it s on sale or after some major bug fixes but still a very enjoyable expireience
My dog could make a better game
awsome game if i could play without it crashing
game is good most fun ive had with friends in awhile but the devs or main dude is not good streamers have been banned for finding glitches on stream they are going against everything they were saying theywould do from the beginning it makes me sad to see this game become h1z1 all over again
People complaining about crates which is cosmetic and there s me who jump in to get crates selling them and made profitgood game if you can made profit out of it
I have super mixed feelings about this game On one hand it is a very fun very tense battle of survival that is great when it gets down to the last few Just hiding on a hill waiting for people to duke it out is still as exciting as going in with your whole squad and whiping out a team of three I love the tense fights where action could happen out of nowhere The map is fun to explore and there is plenty of fun places to check out The devs are optimizing well I used to not be able to run this very well but now I can run it pretty smoothly with a few updates So now even a few potatos can run this which is niceOn the other hand it s buggy and experiences a lot of what other Early Access titles have Just go in expecting that The player base is toxic as hell Don t try to solo Don t try to join a duo with strangers Don t try to squad alone It s horrible and most people don t speak your language You might meet a nice kid or two or a cool person willing to grind with you but most often than not you get some person that doesn t know your language and they ruin your funIt s fun It s fun and challenging and getting that Chicken Dinner is really rewarding after slogging through a half an hour of tense gunfights But the playerbase is horrible it s a little buggy  to be expected of course and now the devs are dropping microtransactions on usI m really stuck between really loving it and really hating it and most of the time I m really hating it
REAL REVIEWFun game i usually play it to past time between other games Its a great way to keep things interesting Now im no pro player by any means i dont play alot of shooters and i have yet to win a game but ive come oh so close at least 3 times so with that said lemme give you what its likeFUN  the game is fun to play by yourself but joining a twitch party or even playing with your friends further the entertainment and can provide some good laughs or just good times in generalCOMPETITIVE  Weather its the coins your after the bragging rights or that number one spot  this game STAYS competitive Well its obvious with 100 people on the map at once but you get the pointCOMMUNITY  Turn down your mics in the lobby cause kids screaming in your ears and loud people crowd the starting lobby But somehow I ve been blessed with nothing but chill decent teammates which most had mic s which helped and made things kinda fun Also there is a HUGE following of this game now so hardly any wait times nowGROWTH  With the future content thats in store as this game makes its way to xbox this game just looks more and more exciting with a new map and possible cross platform gaming incomming This game looks and feels like it has a lot to offer in the future and will only get better with timeNow with the goods there are bads  most people fail to realize that this is an EARLY ACCESS GAME which means all the bugs and unwanted crashes are gonna happen But the only problems ive ever had with this game was server crowding one day and the wall glitch but I dropped out of that game in a heartbeat But other than that i cant really complainOh and the issue with the in game cash shop not a problem Clothes dont affect anythingBut all in all for an early access game this is awesome     Better than H1ZI love playing this game weather i have friends to play with or just solo n up by myselfTHIS IS ONE AWESOME GAME I RECOMMEND IT
After spending many hours on the test server as frustrating as the lag and rubber banding continued  continues to be I can see the direction toward a solid game forming on the horizon10 Launches very soon and hopefully the live servers can handle it I can t wait to experience all the changes in a responsive and polished environment with a few surprises and rewards left in for people who have already spent hours improvement to many issues from base game and earlier testsbright future and high level of support from developercore game is very solid and debatably skill based which actually makes for a nice balance of players  network issues everywhere expect that to get much worse upon live server launch hard to microscopically anaylse things when not playing on a server in my own region bluehole is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at communicating on time and clearly ghost changes post patch notes etcFor now I do recommend the final experience i had in the test build even with all of it s glaring network issues and other frustrating little things Looking forward to 10 release
Instead of balancing the game more adding in the ability to jump walls fixing the thousands of bugs that are so vastly prevalent to the majority of the fan base  and even heavily reported or updating the crash reporter to be useful These clowns are trying to go ESO and Barbie for money The concept was fantastic but the programmers are CLOWN SHOES
GTX 1070 Ryzen 5 SSD hdYou could salt the roads in Canada in the middle of December with all the tears from people losing their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  over the fact that their potatoes can t run pubbers at a decent FPSGame runs buttery smooth on my rig 80 fps everywhere with settings maxed 110 with everything set just right I ve not once had the game crash during normal play only a couple times on the test servers which can happen It s called a TEST server Almost every issue people have is hardware related Time to upgrade your Intel integrated graphics card into something real
I understand ther are some complaints about this game Truth be told I have had several moments where I was LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at the game and the devs However I feel it is important for us to understand there is no such thing as a perfect system While I am not too happy about the news of paid crates I cannot help but still be in love with this game I support the devs and support the title Being a grateful member of this community I have accepted to see this one through all the ups and downs I am sure it will have quite a few downs in the future but I believe in the devs and I belive in this game No game has offered me this much fun in years I just got my frist chicken dinner 4 hours ago and am still excited I think you guys should remember if you have nothing to do but to complain maybe this one isn t for you like you originally thought  however if you are like me you will see this one through no matter what and never stop playing Let s support our dev team more and believe in them in the end I think they will get this one down Please stop the hate comments they understand the problems and are well aware of the public oppinion They work hard as hell to ensure everyone is on a level playing field and can have an enjoyable and immersive experience Thank you to the devs thank you to my community that I cheerish so highly I love all of you guys we are family lets stick this one out and keep playing it will get the way it needs to be in some time  3
Paid boxes Eventhough I manage to earn a few bucks off this game
PUBG is so 2017
vmware IS NOT ALLOWED REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
this game has no ranking system at all therefore no matter your skill level  this being my first battle royale game it is impossible to get used to the feel of it because everytime you land in an area with any loot no matter what guide i follow i get 1 2 kills then get sniped landed at multiple places on multiple maps and just can t seem to catch on even after 36 hours would not recommend for anyone who wants to learn the feel of battle royale games
Fun game runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trash
This is worth 2699 With two current maps a new 4x4 and 8x8 kilometre map coming to the game soon there is a lot to do I wil admit being killed by hackers or people who use recoil macros is annoying but the hackers are being dealt with well and constantly being banned There aren t many bugs but when a new bug is found Bluehole are quick at patching these The game is balanced however it is hard to get used to the shooting style and looting since you need to know what ammo goes for what gun and what attachments do what It s heartbreaking to come second but relieving af when you get a chicken dinner Overall I recommend this for anyone who likes battle royale games as it adds a whole new experience to the scene however not everyone can run it which is sad but the game is always being optimised to run better
this game is very enjoyable yes i am trash at the game but it is very fun I dont have many hours but i plan on playing more Totally better than fortnite but does cost money and is more challenging
crashes at random moments on a high end pc
People saying the cash keys to open the LIMITED ADDITION CRATES is broken promises are morons   The cash from the keys is going to the tournement you idiots and you dont even need to open them you can sell them for 4 bucks a pop you MORONS LOL I dont understand people lol they are so dumb
Game is a lot of fun   I am hearing horror stories of the developers panderign to streamers  a la banning people for honking horns near them but I have not nor do I know anyone who has experienced this personally That being said i d be pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  too As far as microtransactions go  Yes they exist ingame no you don t have to participate There are 2 crates the  locked  one that requires the purchase of a key and one that you can open without making a purchase Additionally a percentage of the purchases go to charity so it beats the hell out of CSGO or Dota or Tf2 microtransactionsAnyways Great last man standing style game with random loot that ensures that no two matches are alike One of the few games that I legit enjoy solo or partied up
its good bad
I cannot play this game as it stands right nowIf I go to the options and try to change any settings while in game it crashes my desktopIt s a shame because it looks like a great game otherwiseRefunded until optimizedBefore you complain about my hardware just look at my profile
I ve died more flippping vehicles than getting shot This game is god s final work
I need to point out that th egame is hella fun with friends and even without them it is true that the microtransactions are a bit bad but if you don t need them then don t complainIn my little experience with the game I ve seen a ton of bugs and lack of optimization on the gamemy pc is very capable to run the game however I ve experiences texture bugs such as   The buildings don t load meaning that i can see through wall and can t enter buildings because the door doesn t load this last for 2 3 min every round I ve searched what s the reason and it turns out that the RAM  8gb is to low and that I need to get a SSD which sucks  sometimes my game crashes just by opening the inventory when I m falling from the plane or even when the game is about to endApart from this anoying glitches the game can be really fun and entretaining I myself recommend to wait until the game is a bit more optimized since it still hasa long way to go
Crates approach is fishy
alright game needs polish in areas just reveiwing for the badge
Wow
really good game already despite some performance issues but so far the devs have done a great job to improve things client and server sidepure adrenalineWhy are ppl crying about paid keys and crates  you get free crates which you can sell for good amounts on the steam marketplace there is no need to buy keys if you don t like em It s not as if the engine developers were suddenly creating models those are 2 different jobs So no introducing paid crates to the game doesn t  have to slow down other sections of development it might even help to hire more engine developers  p I almost clicked on  I received this product for free  as the stuff I have dropped so far has almost covered the costs
this game is absolutely terrible dont even think or even bother reading the people that give this game ratings of postive where to start wellPros  there is noneCONS  lagg compensation game is choppyclunky jumping is not the best thing  in this game its actually the worst rego is absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers are still broken game is broken game is buggy another cash grab game for another lot of devs too many cheaters i have seen so far the game is absolutely made poorly
Region Locking China is the solution Remove the china numba one crap Buggy version was better than the china numba one version lmao I don t suggest unless china numba one bug gets fixed
Overall garbage trash simple as that
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the hater s about microtransactions i ve been playing this game for fun because i enjoy it and ive just been selling my crates i ve gotten for free I ve made over 10 from crates when the game itself was only 27 and i ve had fun doing it Besides the microtransactions it s a great game with great gameplay and there s loads being added each month ranging from new weapons and new vehicles to the new maps they plan to add within the next few years It s a game a really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing good game Buy it
h1z1 is not goodPUBG is good amen ps not subway datway
Game runs great and it gets better with each update given These Negative votes are being slammed through because of the microtransactions that are in the game now Something you do NOT need and probably will be timely since it is only for the limited time skins for the Gamescom prize pool I play this game daily with groups of people and have a blast without any issues besides some stutter due to my graphics settings that i choose to deal with to make the game look good I have a pretty damn fun time
Great game yes yes
Not digging this trend of early access games charging for cosmetic loot boxes
Servers are too busy please try again later
they are adding those LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing microtransation LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  would not recommend
Cosmetics do not apply to PAID content Holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you cry babies does having a 400 dollar skirt give a player an advantage  No Paid content would be like not able to access a weapon or a map that inhibits the player from playing without playing No one is forcing you to buy loot crates and it doesn t stop you from playing the same game as everyone else Now go play the game sell the boxes and make some money
Low optimization Too bad EA games should be free
I absolutely love this game However I can t recommend it as it s current state is leading it in the wrong direction Greene and Bluehole were promising in the beginning but the game took off WAY too fast leading to a competitive esports championship of which Greene said is not a priority Now we have microtransactions in a game WHICH HAS NOT CAME OUT OF EARLY ACCESS and which GREENE SAID WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN EARLY ACCESS So why has it gone this way  My guess is they saw how much money they were making as the game s player base grew larger let greed take over and now want to milk their cow for all it s worth even if that means breaking promises and GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES HAD BEEN If the developers can straighten out their prioities then think about buying this game but for now hold off on this game as all you d be doing is pushing the entire gaming community one step back into the microtranaction and dlc era just as I thought we were about to leave it If we keep buying these games with microtansactions than whats next  Monthly subscriptions to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing pong
Optimize the game ffs
this game will have a good future
Best Battle Royale Game
If you can get your panties out of a wad about the microtransactions that don t affect the gameplay at all then you will like this game 1010
Worst RPG StoryLine ever tried to talk to some guy started hitting me with a pan
PUBG is an awesome and fun game and the microtransaction LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE torm does not change that You can get cosmetic items that mostly make you much more visible in game for 250 If you do not want them just dont buy them ez Paid Maps Weapons or even ghilliesuits in any crate would be a reason for such a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE torm but not some useless skins
This game is a ton of fun do not listen to the others just because of microtransactions Go by what the game is made for survival One little thing should not destroy a game if you don t like it then do not pay extra 1010 I d give this game you never know what will happen always different each time
Microtransactions
                                    HackersAdd 8 players squad as a regular mode
Its a good game but the amount of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s u come across that are hacking is unreal
It s a great game    everything that I wanted that DayZ wasn t Very polished for an Early Access game and content is consistently added Only issues are with the developer s communication with the playerbase They added microtransactions which they had promised they wouldn t For me it s not a problem because they re purely cosmetic It s an early access game they need to test stuff before it is released Of bigger issue to me is their constant coddling of streamers and handing out unfair bans Though is will never affect me as stream sniping and honking around streamers is a bit childish it s not banworthy and  PU has gone about this the wrong wayIt s a great game and if you re morally okay with supporting a developer that may break some promises and handle PR poorly you should buy it
This game is fun It is worth the money Don t let all the negative reviews fool you Microtransactions are for keys for purely cosmetic items that are ugly and still have no idea why people pay so much for some of this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on the marketplace I m just balancing out the scale a bit The first person mode is a god send The 6 core optimization that just happened is amazing Continuous updates I just hope it gets to a finished state before actual release
I m supposed to be preparing for the board exam But here I am Playing this game
Great mix between DayZ and H1Z1 micro transactions are needed to play the game and it gets updates every other day which takes money to keep doing  duh
This game is GREAT The people who complain that you can buy crates That are PURELY COSMETIC ITEMS for real money are just idiots A little thing more dont buy unless you know someone you can play with Alone the game can be boring but with friends LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  its fun af LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
1010 would forget to put on Full auto mode on uzi again
Ignore complaints about Microtransactions You don t have to buy anything at all for any reason You can still earn the same chests and items as before without buying a single thing And it s to fund Gamescom event the rest goes to charity
Broke LOVE LOVE LOVE  Game That Crashes More Than You Paid For It
So I would say I have experience in other MOBAs and compared to these  DotA2 LoL PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is a very good game The mechanics are so different to all the others some may consider the graphics very nice although I personally do not I can see the appeal some people won t and some people will That s how the cookie crumbles with this style I like the character roster but from a f2p standpoint I sense this game will be a bit dry to play The 5 avalible characters at least for this week of writing this review are kind of boring 2 I enjoy playing but then there is  punch guy    obligatory turret man and  minotaur  who I find to be extremely boring characters This will however change when the cycle of weekly  i assume weekly characters change Although I do believe the starter pack is extremely reasonable as you unlock 8 heroes  or whatever In conclusion from a f2p standpoint I think this game may get stale over time as it is hard to get coins quick but otherwise I love the mechanics and overall feel of the combat system of the game and believe it has great potential Only other criticism is that I think the launcher is very frustrating as you have to have steam open to play it as it is installed on steam and it confuses me a bit  although I am stupid
  
this game is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but fun all the same
Changing my review from bad to good As the cheatting level I experience per game has decreased a lot
PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds has taken the genre popularized by games like DayZ and boiled it down to only its best parts making for quick and accessible rounds of pure hassle free survival based action Even though its as rough around the edges its absolutely worth playing right now I will continue to play as it gets closer to a full launch and revisit this review with updated thoughts once its out of early access
its kinda bad for my anxiety tho
love the game really its great however i hope it doesnt turn into cs go with expensive cosmeticsi mean havent they made enough money EDIT Just heard the money from the crates and keys is going to charitys and tournament participantsalthought they did break the promise they are just harmless cosmetics
This game is a point and click shooter 90  of the time 1v1 fights are just you and the other dude just standing still Not much skill required
This game is in an unfinished unoptimized state right now which makes it difficult for weaker PCs to run this game properly I m talking graphics that aren t loading random stuttering or sudden crashes If you are in possession of a beastly PC you shouldn t have that much to worry about but some crashes will still occur nevertheless The Gameplay on it s own is really enjoyable and fun to me though but it is sometimes interupted by the things i mentioned above Right now with the game being in this current state I can unfortunately not recommend this game for the price they are charging for it I might change my mind later on though
Great Time KillerEarly Beta so far so goodA Lot of fun
Ah One of the Greats of this years Early Access The Quick Answer Q Is the game fun A ABSOLUTELY Bring friends to get the best experience thoughQ2 Should I buy it immediately  A2 Mmm Sure but you ought be cautious and know what your getting into Objectively looking at the game it is quite a mixed bag The Long Story  NOTE this is my first  battle royal esque  game so my view point when I might refer to H1Z1 or DAYZ may not be completely accurate However I have been following those games and watching gameplay for quite a while now so I should have a general ideaSo as many have countlessly stated this game can be very entertaining and rewarding when it wants to beWhether you are a team player or a lone wolf player there is something for everyone But do take into account that having friends to play with will enhance the experience a lot It can be hell to work with strangers in team matches Random matching can often end up with strangers screaming in their microphones for the mistakes you or someone in your team made be it on purpose or not Speaking of which there are people who don t have microphones By that point coordinating a must in team matches will become impossibleAlso by the very nature of the game it can get very aggressive in both gameplay and voice chat You ll be often greeted with politically infuriating sometimes hilarious statements being thrown about If you have seen any of the Asian Server gameplay  China NO1  and  Taiwan NO1  hilarious if your from neither will be the first thing you ll hear If you get easily offended by such things this game might not be for youTo strictly talk about the gameplay side I d say PUBG is a middleground between H1Z1 and DAYZ What I mean by this is that it doesn t take it self too seriously to the point it is rediculously realistic like DAYZ but at the same time is gritty enough that it doesn t feel too arcadey like H1Z1 Bullet ballistics are user friendly with a touch of reality enough to make you think twice before shooting  a target hundreds of meters away with an UZI Maps and vehicles are also well crafted and spaced that you have a feeling of open world but not overwhelmed at the same time Weapons are in variety and most are well balanced boiling down to personal taste than the actual specs Not claiming that there aren t some weapons you might want to switch out later but PUBG does leave a lot of room for strategy So even if you don t have the best gun doesn t automatically mean you are screwed  Overall its a good mix which I think is one of the reasons people are gravitating towards PUBGNow gameplay is one thing but being a great game is another Like I mentioned PUBG is kind of a mixed bag While the gameplay it self is great there are major issues with the game like optimization and server crashes Optimization has been greatly improved over the days but there is still much to be desired If you don t have the latest desktop packing some major computing power prepare to lower settings Even on Highend PCs there can be stuttering from time to time Not saying that it is completley game breaking but its something you might consdier if you like 60fps with all your gamesServers are something that worries me though I get that the number of PUBG players are growing rapidly but this issue with servers going down and people not being able to play is happening very often Its has been a problem since day one and we are still seeing it Bluehole the dev is not a small company  They have the capital They even have an mmo under their belt as well so its not even lack of experience Why they won t expand to a server size more capable is beyond meWhile I do recommend this game Please be cautious and think through before buying because you never know what will happen with an Early Access game The servers and optimization issues are likely being tolerated because it is still Early Access However if the problems persist through full release a lot of player base may abandon the game The devs won t care either because they already have your money and LOTS OF IT tooNow if your still convinced to buy it GET IT GET IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN And enjoy that chicken dinner while it last Cheers and good hunting  
Great fun when you have friends to play with if you like battle royal games Arguably the best of its genre Can be frustrating at times
For a game thats still in Alpha its almost a pleasant surprise that server stability is one of the biggest issues facing the game Desync is a bigger killer than any gun Servers and netcode can be upgraded and improved thankfully Its a pity that players have to butt heads with uncooperate internet tubes but Bluehole Studios have made an immersive and energizing game that improves upon nearly every aspect of the budding survival arena genre
Too much of this game is Client side bad FPSbuilding up to be quite the money grab easy hacks no clear development pipeline EA paid DLC  meh  servers  Bans seem a bit too common  read one offense bans Between a clearly immature inexperienced  Dev  and shoddy politics and business practices I gotta say NOright now Its popular because its popular not because its good      ok its pretty good but there needs to be some better direction and communication between the Devs and the users  specifically about the  planned features and what they are doing as a studio to better the game  as well as both parties accepting their responsibility for making a well developed game things like providing solid reliable mechanics and the community being vocal on feedback and the devs working dilligantly to work around that feddback This is EA after all its been touted as  EA done right   finally  they really need to prove it         I really do hope they fix their Development pipeline and start grinding the problems out instead of letting them become exhaggerated by the sheer magnitude of the game in of itself The sheer size of this game may yet be its down fall if the developer is not careful the straw that breaks the camels back as it was          Do I regret my purchase  No This game creates great  moments  and it s tense yet dull at the same time Kinda like chugging a redbull while upside down in a plane Nothing paticularly impossible but it has its merits I suppose Oh and gimme that Pan
This game is great much fun much wow much explody mucho intenso aka you ll prolly kys
The company has made enough cash off of the game and they are already begging for micro transactions and skin purchases on a game that isnt even finished These micro transactions are fueling the cheating even more as now cheaters can earn even more of a profit As a US player it is becoming increasingly frustrating to play squad when half of your team doesnt speak English  rather Mandarin Migration to other servers is becoming a problem for gameplay as well as the latency and lag makes my computer drop frames causing me to lose a heated match All because someone is in the wrong server The company refuses to fix these issues or even talk about them in full detail explaining what they will do in detail to fix them Gameplay is not enjoyable when you have wait constantly for the servers not to be full then get into a match just to have someone spawn their own stuff and kill you instantly using cheats Gameplay is not enjoyable when you are working with a squad and everyone else speaks a different language from you causing you not to be able to coordinate This game would be great and I would recommend it to people if Bluehole fixes all these issues Otherwise dont buy it
everyone hating on this game are sore losers who suck at the game i have only seen 1 forsure cheater out of several hours on the game i was a LEM in csgo so i am use to the cheaters and this game barely has any people LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing just suck at the game and can t get a chicken dinner
With 10 out the game made a major step in the right direction Hopefully it only gets better from here and we will see frequent updates to the game for a long timeOptimizations  especially for Erangel are still needed though and the  netcode  could also be improved including packet handling and server tick rate Other than that the game finally feels and plays like an FPS should  TPP is basically non existent for me with some frame pacing issues here and there
Soooo why would anyone play h1z1 anymore 
This game is great but still there is a lot of hackers and bugs so i think its gonna be fixed in next big update
PUBG team working very hard on this Great game I can t wait for final version 
I ve had some of the best multiplayer experiences with this game but it went to production release prematurely and because of that I am changing my review to a thumbs down The game feels broken which was okay in alphabeta Now it is just frustrating to play because of the constant server issues and bugs I don t even mind the cheating as much as I mind the sub par quality of the game performance

CHINESE HACKERS

supppppppper flippiin funnnnn sold my wife to buy it   
Connected Waiting for response Servers are too busy please try again later Lag detected Just a few sentences you will see very oftenAlso a bunch of cheaters glitchers wallhackers aimhackers  You name it the game will give it to you You can also buy crates with microtransactions in an early access game  Really 1010 would lag again
50  of players is hackers etcGame is not interesting people playing it only for the lootboxes aka crates to sell them on steam market and get money that s also explains why there s so much hackers
Hardcore FPS Probably the most fun you can have in video gaming if you have friedns if not mic up and be friendly All about team work Must buy
This game is plauged with hackers and crashes  It s come a long way from EA but this game is still really frustrating
THIS GAME IS A DRUGRegardless of the recent LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s crying over micro transactions PUBG is a very fun and exciting game to play I have way too much fun with this game and sometimes have to use the girlfriend as a foot rest as i spend lots of time playing the game late at night So far i have found nothing wrong with this game it s fast slow enticing and a DRUG Team work is amazing and the game provides players the scenario to be team leaders in your groups It s fun to see a game bring back teamwork so well wether it was the point of some of the gameplay or not it s one of the main points to why i play this game a lot I would reconmend this game to people who love intense gun fights close quaters or far You arent safe anywhere on this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hole of an island  What i would change is the physics and realism mostly the physics as some cars can spaz out harder than a COD playerSecondly this game could improve with future maps free to the community and none of this mainstream DLC LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Keep your game cooler than ice and give your growing fan base the respect of a true game developer shouldAlthough there is word of a desert map coming i think we all want to see a Jungle map with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all veiw distance and an Urban map for the campers to live in  p Good game overall and would love to see more maps and content
Can t even get past the nickname screen just keep getting error 30 well spentNow I understand the game is working progress but c mon
Great game and well poloshed for an early access game Ignore the negatvie reviews on microtransactions because as long as it isnt p2w then its fine with me
This game used to be really fun but I can t deal with the issues anymore It crashes constantly servers are always unreliable and the game is extremely buggy This is alpha bad To call this a 10 release is embarasing I really wish this game will be fixed but its just been unplayable since the latest updates They somehow made the game worse And instead of making the game better and optomising it and making improvements they decide that vaulting and a new map were a better way to improve the game Please fix your  esports ready  game and stop adding unnecessary things until you have a working game
Gets very repetitive real quick Even playing as a squad could be horrendous especially when other players dont have or refuses to use a mic  Scores take forever to accumulate But the worst is the overly constant Network lags and random game crashes WAAAAY TOO MANY SHOTGUNS and the center point of each map is way too predictable if you watch the pattern of the angle of plane when the match startsIMPROVEMENTS NEEDED A better score system  It takes way too much time to get your score high enough to get more clothingBetter building design Too many of the buildings are hard to find the stairs  takes too much time even if you do a quick 360 and many times its hard to get from upstairs back to the ground level  especially when you need to leave in a hurryBetter vehicles  What I mean by this is  again when you are in a hurry it is hard to get to right angle to pop up the option to enter a vehicle especially as a driver Its next to impossible to do so while under fireBetter vehicle rules on a team  When a team is shooting from within a vehicle friendly fire should be temporarily turned off
Way to many asians on EU NA servers etc this ruins the game kind of cause they dont know squat english Play with friends and its fun something has to be done about this invasion of Servers
BEST GAME I VE EVER PLAYED I would recommend that they add a team text chat thought because if you re playing squador dous no mics can t respond
super good game
Absolute madness Rate it though 4 starsEdit 2311   Yeah nah still good Not much hacking going on in OCE healthy competition The sooner 10 arrives proper the better Keep the faith these devs have a few tricks up their sleeve left
A week after it s release I explored my store que as always stumbling across this diamond in the rough At first glance i thought  survival rpg mmo cars and more ohhh MY I bought the game instantly without watching the trailer After i had an initial turn i passed the controls over the my fiends Not to impressed  mind you this was week one of release i bribed my mates with extra copies spending more than 150 on extra copies for them so i had teamates to play with For those out there who doubt love at first site well keep stronge in faith my friends because it does exist I saw this gem when she was just a baby and instantly took a leap of faith NOw look at the diamond she shines in glory today pubg all the way dave rn
at least better than fortnite
This Game has it all You can play tacticaly or run and gun Solo or with friends With the last patch you can now play in First person or classic third person With PUBG being in early access and tanking into account its early success you can count on alot of new content this is very good if you are loking to get the best bang for your buck So join us we are waiting
Solid 45
Don t let Walker drive
Highly addictive Very tense  I m pretty much the best driver in PUBG My mates always compliment me on my driving skills
You just gotta play to understand
Made 50 dollars playing this game money making simulator
This is a must have game people are butt hurt about boxes but they fix the game all the time and improve it every weekPros gun play is great teams are great report system is great its greatCONS lag sometimes  i cant find the sight i need need more loot
The devs are working like crazy to optimize the game  and make money of course I don t mind all the new crates partly because I always end up making money by selling new crates for crazy high prices but also because the team gets more money to work with and more money  better game PUBG has seriously been improved alot since the initial beta release and now feels and acts like a full game with a team of devs instead of a side project by one guy
OOO
PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes  approx 90 players alive after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die  approx 60 70 players alive After the 3rd4th blue circleYou start to believe that you can achieve the impossibleyou could possibly winyou ll taste the sweet fruits of victory 10 players remainingyou ve made it to top 10but you still want moreno more mistakes or joking around nowyou re close last 2 playersyou believe in thisyou can win But alasyou make an idiotic mistake You end as 2that moment will haunt you foreverThis is what will happen every game you ll feel rage anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is overuntil you start the next one Welcome to the battleground
i cant play it after installedhelppp
This is juicy
You have  8  extended quickdraw SR mag sniper rifle silencer but no SKS    and you killed by the guy with SKS with no attachments    but he can t loot you because of the zoneAnd next time you find SKS but the whole game you can t find ammo for it you just find SCAR M16 M416 and lots of 556    oh right you don t have a backpack too    or there is only UZI and lots of 9mm 1010and recoil of m249 should be fixed cause it is really OP
Shame about the microtransactions  otherwise great game
1010 steel pan base ball
 can we talk about how it takes 5 6 566 rounds 7 8 9mm rounds two chest kar 98k rounds but 3 4 punches to kill somone Are these little 120 pound women possessed by Mike Tyson  nuff said lmfao update  games still bad i try to enjoy it ya know worst combat ive seen yet
Highly recommend the game it feels good and looks good                 tips for buying  Must have a ssd and 8gb of ram or more one down fall game is poorly optimized and severs are abit slow but other wise a very good game        For me one of the best games on steam
Awesome game 99  of the bad reviews you re going to read are about the recent  limited time Introduction of paid keys for a charity event and to fund their pubg tournament They give absolutely nothing except cosmetic items that make no difference and usually end up putting you at a disadvantage because the coloring is so flamboyant on a lot of the rare setsYou start with 100 people dropping along a random predetermined path off a plane as it flys through an island You loot find meds weapons armor upgrades ectAfter the initial drop a random circle appears on the map that you have to get into in a certain amount of time or you will slowly die This circle gets progressively smaller as the game goes onOne personteam at the end is declared a winner and receives a chicken dinner There s no other game that gets my adrenaline pumping like pubg and there s nothing quite as satisfying in any other game as getting that chicken dinner

This game is excellent for an ALPHA the negative reviews are not really correct as the micro transaction are a temporary fund raising event for the tournaments and charities and 2 for a key is not really a big deal but all goes to a good cause with regular weekly and monthly updates this game gets better and better Already surpassing CSGO and H1Z1 in the top games available in this genre i definatly recommend this game to all
You thought BF and COD players are camping way too much Try this Campsimulator 2017  _ _
This game is amazing but poor preformance
I have played this game since it first hit in like April of 2017 and played way more than I should have This game has been broken since it came out and has not truely been corrected in a year Hackers run rampant servers are poor causing tremendous lag optimization is non existent The devs turned on the community as soon as they got their money and instead of turning around and fixing what was broken they came out with loot crates that you had to buy keys for I cannot recommend this game Although I will still end up playing from time to time I have not come to even enjoy this game even when winning it is such short lived You can win a game and the next game you enter you get killed by a hacker and the win escapes your mind If you want to spend your next year overly frustrated like I have in this past year then go ahead and pick up this game I pray I can edit this review in another 6 months to a year and say that the Devs came back and helped out
New Update  Bugs Bugs Bugs Bugs
Good game but isn t well optimised
ALPHA  its just a fun game adicting and fun there is bugs i might admit but i chuckle more then take it serious becuase i know it will get fixedFull Realese  Better graphics less lag extra map HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS
SO MUCH FUN the game plays great with very few minor bugs that need to be worked out VERY playable my friends and i came from miscreated and dayZ and end up playing this more than both i7 7700k and gtx 1080 plays this smoothly on ultra with good temps i recommend playing duo mode with a friend though its rough out there for a lone wolf910
good stuff honestly a great time you should be already playing
Great game I hope some great features get added Like add friend
Good game but everyone is lucky apart from me and its full of hackers but its much better than the strategy crap like civ 5
Ignore all the negative comments about micro transactions The  microtransactions  are all going to charity and towards the top teams of a tournament This will only promote the game and support it s playersThe game itself is great offering short playthroughs seem to be improving and fixing pre release issues along the wayIf you are on the fence and this style of game intriged you in the first place then it s what you were hoping for
this game need night mod
needs alot of workbut overall an really fun gameespecially when u have an full squadjust buy itand have fundont go all serious when playing
Right now game is not enjoyable except with some moments which ocurr once a weekCons  game is very laggy and unoptimized  just like Arma 3 what do i mean by that  i have a gaming pc and i can play battlefield 1 and Ghost Recon Wildlands with no lags at medium settings in both those games i am in controll of my movement and weapon But movements and weapon control are laggy in this game  no matter how skilled you are this game will make you feel like a noob who finds the best weapon and scope is in clear advantage of course if you manage to shot considering lags and poor weapon control  no matter how youtubers you have watched who recommend this game or make it look like super fun in the curent state it is not like i said you might have some fun moments once a week if thats all you want then go buy the game  you need to have a good gaming pc minimum requirements for this game will not help  currently this game has serious issues example  you reach the ground and you see houses are cartoonish you cannot ender in any of them to loot you have to wait by that time you probably will be killed by another guy who landed in an area closer but with less lags WHICH OF YOU GUYS HAVE PLAYED BATTLEFIELD 1 OPEN BETA  IT WAS AMAZING SMOOTH AND FUN GAMEPLAY NOW THINK OF THIS GAME AS THE OPOSSITE EXPERIENCETHE NUMBER OF PLAYERS PLAYING THIS GAME MEAN NOTHING if you think the number of players playing the game right now indicate that the game is fun dont believe that DOTA 2 has more players than this game are you going to play Dota 2 DONT GET ME WRONG  If this game gets optimized and is lag free and smooth like battlefield 1 then shoting experience is fun right now it is not Devs need to make this game enjoyable not only for very skilled players They need to spawn more assault riffles scopes and vehicles in the game In the future i will give another review if devs make this game playable considering what i observed above
doesnt really run very well graphics are nothing special overall it ll be fun in 2 3 years when the dev s work to make it better but for now i returned it Rich mans minecraft hunger games
solid game for friends to play better than king of the kill and the core game is fun but there are some bugs that surfaced in the new update that that aslo adds new content so stop crying
The people who have written the highest ranked negative reviews have like a median of 300 hours played lol910
fun gamefor a timeThe game is 95  BS 100000 hackers and people that can hear you tiptoeing a block away when they have someone shooting an AR next to both ears and a car chase going by Yes  realistic right   no  how about you shooting a guy with a pistol 3 times in the chest but wait two punches from apparently mike tyson drops you dead as he takes your loot that you could grab in the first 2sec of landing and walks away with over 50  health leftIt is fun but to a point They need to fix alot
I was gone for a few months and come back to the same old crappy game Before adding skins and what not fix your goddamn game
FIX THE SERVERS
its sex
 F        CK this game its so buggy  wow its almost as if this game is still in beta 
Actually it s a good game because there was no problem with refund  
Szar ne vegytek meg bugos fos pfujj hnyadk
This game is the worst Not worth a single penny for this game1 The game is under developed with limited content It comes with only 3 maps a few USABLE weapon  most of the weapon is trash2 The randomness of the loots 3 This game is full of bugs eg stuck in the wall sometimes couldnt loot item and more4 The sound is the worst 5 And of course microtransaction I have nothing against microtransaction but to pay a full price for a game the crates that we earned in game have to unlock with keys that have to be purchased    WTF 
How to buy guns

fuxking  motherfxcker  cheaters
This game ois pretty good but has a lot of bugs to fix
Fantastic You will not get an adrenaline rush like this in gaming
laggy afffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
I love this game it is SO much fun Unfortunately they broke one of the most solemn vows in the video game market They promised to keep away from microtransactions which they recently have added There is also now a crate system similar to that of CS GO s This keeps people buying keys over and over for their newest  gamescom  crate I love this game and I don t think the crates are too detrimental however I simply cannot respect developers that go back on their promises This is why I cannot recommend this game
I really wish people would stop hating this game based on the fact they introduced micro transactions Monthly updates they do listen to the community whether people choose to believe that or not if there is a problem with the game they tend to fix it within a few hours They add what we want yeah they added creates you can still unbox normal ones that are free and don t cost anything to open you don t have to buy them it s only clothesBut the game is amazing other than the vac wave after summer sales cs go was unplayable at ranks higher than lem due to the amount of hackers and nothing was being done instead of fixing lag and hit boxes valve added gloves and more ways to make money  Battlegrounds is the best of it s kind in battle arena genres evident by the sales and positive reviews I shouldn t have to go into why this game is amazing other people have already done that But stop saying you don t recommend this game because of the micro transactions that make no difference to the competitiveness and play of the game If people want to buy keys for clothes they will You don t have too it doesn t effect you you can still get the other creates for free
The micro transactions and loot system is ruining the game  I m not mad about their broken promise regarding the no microtransactions it s that it takes away from the fun  Playing the game to collect new and exciting loot is gone because you can just buy stuff now  Games need some kind of level up or loot system to give a sense of progression after a good play sesion  But alas they wanted more money so they added in microtransactions  This was after they promised they wouldn t  I wish there were a games company out there with an ounce of integrity
where is the oceanic serverin siberia  3 or 4 times to connect to a server per gameand then its like running around on a melted candle for 3 minutescollecting weapons etc floating in mid air
Optimization beyond LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Computer can run games like Witcher 3 at 60fps so I dont have a potatoGame often drops to a slideshow and is general unplayable Graphics suck so idk why
This game is so infuriating and hard AF  Apparently there is a boycott because of the introduction of microtransactions but i don t care about any of that mess  It s been awhile since I ve wanted to site down and play a multiplayer game and PUBG delivered on that front
I hate this game 1010But seriously I dream about this game in my sleep It s fantastic Nothing like it
Yeah oose oose oose ooose
I love this game but in all seriousness it really is getting worse and worse  Crashes  network lag detected  more and more hackers   every possible LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  aspect of multiplayer gaming you can think of is here in spades and only getting worse   Pre release    sure  The reality however is that this is no longer enjoyable to play
not good much bads
 Servers are too busy at the moment please try again later 
Game is great but servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and it s filled with hackers  
I m going to attempt to keep this review as short and concise as possiblePLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is funmost of the timeThis main problem with the game comes from the core gameplay and the skill you need to win Or lack thereof As you play PUBG you ll realize that to some extent the winner of the round is dependent on the loot RNG of the world and the circle This ruins the  harcore tactical shooter  vibe this game trys to give offWhen you aren t getting screwed over by a new zone that feels like it s 5 galaxies away from you you have to worry about the plethora of connection issues that plague the matches Sometimes randomly in the midst of a gunfight the game will pause and have to re connect to the servers While this not only may bone you over sometimes  giving your opponent more time to think of a way to kill you it s also insanely agitating to have to wait 10 seconds when I m about to lob a guy s head off with a shotgun or when I m running for my life being chased by a squad in a UAZ Overall the devs need to get this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fixedThis sounds like enough to ruin the game right  Well not so muchThe squad and duo gameplay of PUBG in my opinion can be some of the most fun co op ever The sheer amount of strategies you can implement with multiple people at your side is ridiculous Whether it s entering a warehouse tactfully with consequtive flash grenade throws from your friends or driving into the warehouse like a madman and attempting to spin your vehicle 360 degrees so your buddy in the backseat can whack an enemy with his crowbar it feels awesome if you succeedOverall if you have a mic a decent internet connection and good enough PC specs to play I have to recommend this game To me the squad and duo play makes up for the problems tenfold
215 hours currently playedThis game has only been getting better with updatesI highly recommend itThe most recent patch helped the optimization tremendouslyKey n Crate system doesn t bother me if it helps fund the production of this gameSOLID 910
This game is full of intense action and it s addicting to play It s extremely entertaining and I highly reccomend playing it
What a nice server lol
The only patches you get are from wanting to cut yourself from GAME BREAKING PATCHES KILL A GUY  LAYING ON THE GROUND TOO ONLY FIND HES THE ANTI CHRIST WHO RUBBERBANDS BACK AND KILL YOULegit so salty
NowIs this game good  Yes yes it isI played Arma3 and DayZ I m not a stranger to battle royale games so when a friend bought me this I went into it expecting much of the same I even waited a week before I even bothered installing itBoy do I wish I d given it a shot earlierThe game is all around fun It s quick intense gameplay that keeps you on your toes 247 You never know when a guy with a shotgun is gonna come bashing through your front door while you wait for the limit line to reach you so you can move on GAMEPLAY Gameplay is pretty straight forward You jump out of an airplane to choose your own spawn point This is the make or break moment as it s far more likely to die early on if you drop in a frequently dropped in zone where like 30 people are on a 1 sq mile block with 3 houses of loot in it Things get hairy and 2930 are most likely going to die in that place In this game getting kills is not the Priority name of the game Survival is Staying alive until you re the last man standing is the ultimate goal so it s important to differentiate between fights worth picking and to just stay low and let the convoy of friends pass you by rather than hope you can pick them off one by one without them seeing you You ll find progressively better gear as the battleground shrinks in on itself and sometimes if you re lucky you ll drop in a place that s smack dab where the game is gonna end leaving you with a playground full of epic loot that ll leave you stacked and ready before anyone elseThere are 3 versions of the game Not counting custom which are solo duo and squad 4  GRAPHICS Graphics are not exactly something to cheer about They re  adequate  but definitely could be a lot better Due to it being an early access game sadly this also means that there are bugs and texture glitches relatively often but unless you literally get PTSD attacks or something from seeing slightly faulty graphics and serrated edges on building corners from time to time it won t bother you at all PROS   A mediocre community Why is this a pro you might ask  Because voice chat is entirely optional and there is no such thing as text chatlog  Intense fast paced combat that ll have you sweating bullets for hours   Fair hit boxes and no wall clipping Can t shoot through walls in certain situations etc  Outrageously fun with friends Goes up at least 5 stars extra if played with friends  Smooth clear voice chat built into the game And of course there s perimeter conversation as well  No game breaking bugs that I ve seen thus far  Highly customizable weapons and clothing for a personal  build   MASSIVE map with up to 100 players in it  Low price  30 for a really damned good game  Fast and simple entrance to games The longest I ve ever waited from queue to joining was 3 seconds  Over 5 million copies sold and an extremely active game with an average of 280000 people playing on the regular and over 450000 at peak hours Source  Steam Charts CONS   Poor sub standard graphics  Infrequent but catastrophic server connection losses  Very rude and obnoxious community Well at least it seems that way I guess the trolls and idiots spamming slurping noises are more vocal and active than the more serious and mature gamer  Developer promised no microtransactions till the game is done which was honestly a pure 24 karat s    nugget of lies  Loot is RNG based  You might land at a building with no weapons in it at all while the guy next door comes over to say hello neighbor with an AK47 a pump action shotgun and a level 2 police vest FINAL WORD Like I said above  is the game good  Yes yes it is but it has some definite issues which is not really the game itself that s the problem but the slightly unscrupulous developers Go down the negative and even some of the positive reviews and you ll see the lies coming from the devs mentioned over and over and over again specifically the whole lie about microtransactions not happening till after the game was finished and released The devs also claim that they want to use the money from the microtransactions to fund an Esports event for the game except the game revenue that they earned on it is so high they could easily fund a massive esports event to rival Riot Games  League of Legends championships with the utmost ease An estimated 100mi was earned on the game so farI recommend the GAME itself definitely but if the devs do not clean up their act and stop spewing lies to try and convince people to buy their game with empty promises  I m going to rapidly change this review to a negativeIt s so unfortunate too The game is simply astonishingly fantastic
addicting game but sometimes laggy i recomend 110  mony worth
This game is good and it is alot of fun but the only bad thing is that i have and ok computer that runs very well and i can barely play this game I can play games like ark and stuff but if i open my invotory in this game i lag for a solid 10 seconds if i walk up a hill i lag for like 5 seconds When i drop out of the plane the houses dont render in and i have to lay down while my team is dieing just so i can render in the few houses next to me Granted i have supper LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  internet and I m okay with the render stuff i can deal with it But when I open my invtory to put on a scope i dont want to have to sit there for like 10 seconds doing nothing and not being able to help my team just to put on a stupid red dot Over all this game is good but at the same time you need a really good computerinternet to be able to play it
You wanna have a good time with your friends  Then this game is for you You can kill people You can kill teammates  very important You can get rekt by a screaming 11 year old kid You can stunt with the motorcycleAnd much more But the only problem is you got no friends and if you do they will still not buy the game because they think it s to expensive   cough cough  this is not towards my friends at allBut for real get the game It s a ton of fun
For everyone mad about microtransactions GET OVER IT DONT BUY IT IF YOU DONT AGREE WITH ITBut if you want this game to last more then a couple years then let us have our microtransactions so we can support blueball entertainment with providing us servers and content Microtransactions are only for cosmectics So even after we have them the kids that cant aim and say this game is bad will still be here
The developers of this game plan to introduce a SCGO style of micro transaction making you acquire crates and pay for keys It s a terrible system IMO PUBG has recently shown what crates can contain and some of the items are more than cosmetic and will  give you an advantage early on against other players A good example would be the ability to acquire a faceplate protecting you against headshots
I bought this game  really expensive for what I usually spend and it has turned out to run absolutely awful I am v disappointed with it as it has meant the game has essentially become unplayable Every time I drop in nothing loads and the game crashes  I have an MSI gaming laptop this game needs to be optimised or the price needs to be lower
Wow i didnt played for a month Now with the latest update with the stupid microtransactions i got huge lags i got  network lag detected  i nees several attempts to load the game it freezes when i open the inventoryWasted moneyUpdate   It looks like this piece of crap came out Great I tried the second map on the testservers  boring  I played this game  over 280h in early access Now i totally run out of mood for it
best game in the history
This game is good so far i recommend it but theres a issue why it keeps uninstalled by itself The day I finish it installed it all restarted again I mean it says to install again pls fix this sooner  thank you
How to make a game less optized thn ark survival evolved
This is love
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED   STILL LOVE THIS GAME with all the bugs in it
Game has had a couple updates to clear up bugs and help smooth out the graphics Its far from perfect but its alot better then before
PUBG 10 is absolutely amazing lots of bug fixes optimized well maps are very nice
mikmak
1210
it s really bad optimized even with a good computer it s almost imposible to play
Getting 2nd place in this game hurts more than rejected by your crush
Putting in microtransactions and and a crate system before the game is even properly released this game will have a gloomy futureedit  the devs even promised that they wont put these in until a full release
BADDDDD LOVE LOVE LOVE 
dont get this game its the most LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game ive ever played download last man standing its a free version of this game
nae nae
The game has legit issues instead of using all that money they ve gottenand fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game they release micro transactions when this game is not even nearly complete Valve has to get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together too many early release games are pulling this stunt and we re letting them get away with it
The concept for this game is great   after all what about a 100 man battle royal doesn t sound somewhat appealing  Unfortunately there are too many issues I have with the game at this point that I can t really recommend it or at least for now For starters my greatest qualm I have with this title are servers as many would also comploain about It doesn t matter what kind of Google Fibre or Gigaclear connection you have it isn t going to make the servers hosting this game any more responsive as there have been far too many times in which a  Network Lag Detected  error is displayed in game half way through a firefight ultimately resulting in your death Rubberbanding is also another derived issue from this as even after the supposed update where they  addressed  this issue the improvement was only marginal as with most optimisation and bug fixing updates How many times now have they said they ve fixed the problem where open doors can appear closed  It doesn t even matter as it still keeps happeningSimilarly the first 40 deaths in a 100 man game are the period where connection issues are at their finest It is obvious that the servers cannot support that many players with how evident the issues of rubberbanding and funky client side hit detection are It obviously doesn t become a perfect experience after this point but at least it retains playability I don t understand how the devs can t see the easy fix before them   they just need to decrease the max population in each match to be at most 60 players This would easily combat some of frustrations with the game but would mean that more servers would need to be purchased to support this though of course how could the devs afford such luxuries with how little they are making   especially with microtransactions on their way Further I have massive stability concerns for the game beyond what was outlined above as even with a beefy PC having a GTX 1070 amongst other great hardware there was a time where I couldn t even play the game due to constant crashing It got so bad at one point that 15 minutes into every game I got some kind of crash message kicking me out of the match I had to leave it for a month before things got any better as reinstalling it seemed to do nothing but a few weeks after that I started having the same problem This wasn t even the worst part about the crashes either as when I first got the game a couple months back crashes would completely render my desktop unusable with the only fix being to sign out of my account or restart my entire PC  this happened every damn day  At least that s one thing the devs managed to fix by nowEven though there are still so many more bones I have to pick here I ll keep this  short  by only touching on one final point That point is the damned chainlink fences My heart goes out to anyone who has experienced the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  nature of these things that act as pseudo one way barriers for bullets Recounting one encounter I had I had fired 3 SKS shots at some guy on the otherside of one of these death traps who was unarmoured   enough to kill him easily   and not a single shot hit Now it wouldn t be so bad if it ended there but the game decided to flip the bird off at me when this player saw the oppertunity to fire on full auto made through the fence without a single round being blocked by the fence This was even an isolated case either as I encountered this again when  at point blank mind you I had a double barreled shotty shooting at someone on the otherside of the fence Surprise surprise every pellet was blocked by the fence while I got mowed down by him through the very same fenceSimply don t buy this game at the moment if you want a fair reliable or even somewhat enjoyable experience that isn t riddled with bugs and glitches Before the devs decide to fix more crap than they add don t offer them money to keep wasting on useless additions like the VSS  I know that the weapon is controversial in being argued as both good and terrible I find it terrible or Groza  A weapon that took more development hours than the combined time of the weapon being used by this games community I know it s hypocritical to keep playing it after these issues have surfaced but you never know I might be a masochist Just don t make the same mistakes that I have by getting this game impatiently
Great super fun game I ve played a ton of video games FPS es and all and it s very refreshing to play a new kind of game There s tons of complaints about micro transactions here but just so people know the crates are pretty much purely cosmetic so far I d agree it s a problem if the crates and their contents affected the gameplay but so far they do not The crates items are just like TF2 hats CSGO skins League of Legends skins etc etc etc Also there s already free ingame cosmetic crates in place that every player gets every 700 2800 points so idk what the angers about Anyway misinformed anger aside this game is really enjoyable even in its Early Access stage and I recommend picking it up
I like the game it has heart wrenching moments and always leaves me on edge  D
This game I d say is hands down the best game in the  battle royale  categoryIt has great graphics and a realistic feel and tops all the other battle royale games It s main competator is probably H1Z1 which has slowly started to go down hill and is getting worse and worse I didn t say Fortnite because the idea is the same but both play out extremly differentNow some of you may be wondering  if it s such a good game why don t you have a lot of hours on it   The thing is this is for my preferance it isn t a game where I would sit down and play for 7 hours straight as I do with others The reason behind this is it can get quite repeatative and I sometimes get mad when I die in top 5 even though this happens I still keep coming back to it and that is a sign of a good gameI m glad that the game is 2999 because if it were 5999 I would think it was a poor choise of money Not saying it s a bad game but just wanted to put that out I feel like this game is more of a  don t know what to play  type So more of a side game In conclusion if your looking for a battle royale game and don t like the wacky and unrealistic feel of Fortnite then this is hands down the most superior game The graphics and surroundings are great for what it is  a mainly battle based game Keep in mind that if your computer isn t the best then you might not want to gamble the money on it I would just go to Fortnite until you can get a better computerGreat game overall pleased good work PUBG Corporation
NEED Practice Mode
Pretty fun
This game is good for people who like slow paced  to some degree tird person survival shooters On your fight to stay alive till the end you are met with many a foe you eed to tactically kill to gain supremacyAs it is in early acces i cant make too much of a fus about graphic quality and mechanicsI would wait till this game is porperly realeased before investing money into it
good game solo gets boring but squad and duo very fun with a team
An incomplete game that costs 30 has now announced very unorignial flawed and expensive microtransactions Because creating an indie game that raked in more than 180 million in 5 months isn t enough
not worth 30
the game is pretty good actually the microtransactions people s are talking about is not a big deal since it s just cosmetics  no pay to win stuffi have a super low end rig got fps drops everywhere hope they optimize more for minimum spec user
What a bunch of whining children  on these most recent reviews They cant play for one day and crucify the game The devs test out their microtransaction system  its alpha testing phase no crap and even donate the proceeds to a tourney and charity This is game is A and is only getting better with time This is an ALPHA game things will go wrong if you can t handle this wait until full release and STOP  female dog ing
Overall fun game to play with friends dont know wy there is a whole fuss about microtransactions So far its only for apparel
Its pretty okay to be honestAbsolutely fine
ignore the crybabies with their negative reviews The gameplay is very fun  especially with the new first person mode the updates are good they listen to feedback The only negative i can think of is the performance if you dont have the latest hardware you could experience some FPS drop but they are constantly working on it
 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimization Releasing microtransactions in early access after promising they wouldn t Pushing updates out after 1 day on test servers with known gamebreaking bugs Banning innocent players for stream sniping Loves to su
Enjoyed playing this game over the past few months however it s become very repetitive and I find myself no longer engaged when playing it
I like the game but not the broken promises by the devs or the game being turned into a cash cow before full releaseNOT TO FREAKING MENTION IT HAS TONS OF BUGS  lag low fps rate etc etc etc
Great Fun AddictiveMicrotransactions do not bother me despite the controversy over them It does not directly effect the gameplay and everything remains fair play If you dont like the transactions for clothing items which IMO adds nothing but style points Than ignore itPeople say the devs broke there promise and they might have i dont know But its not as if consumers cannot trust them to continue to update and improve the game What more trust do you need anyhow other than expecting improvements  It nots like anyone who writes a review here is directly effected by the developers choice to introduce the transactions despite what they mentioned before UNLESS you just HAVE TO FEEL COMPELLED to buy 50USD in keys for crates than sure dont play the game than and save your moneyBuy this game and play it with you re friends Its alot more fun that way 30 USD is more than worth the fun and playtime I put into this game and if your a fan of survival FPS This is for you
Remember to put the pan behind your A to protect it from bullets keep it safe  
Because a description of the thumbs up is mandatory
Who s idea was it to have the map shrink at a rate faster than you run and have intervals of 2 minutes between that  I played 3 games 2 of which I was constantly running to stay inside the blue circle The 3rd match I got beat down with fists as I walked into a house that hadn t loaded yet and I couldn t see what was going on  bearing in mind I have the game on the lowest settings and my computer isn t bad as it can run other games at quite high settings with 60fps Obviously this is early access and I can forgive the performance issues However the constant running in order to stay in a blue circle just wasn t fun
Coming from Hearthstone experience this game seemed so familiar right away Turn 1 UMP9 vs Bare Hands on the other player instant win So good
good game get snipd every second lol xd
Well made Battle Royale game very fun if playing with friends I would like to see some level system added to this game tho
good game xD
It s good but gets boring after quite a few rounds also devs lieing is not okay  
Yeah Microtransactions n LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
amazing game and i cant wait to see where it goes
Am pleb at the PUBGs but get good giggle n bamboozley from it Teach me how to aim and shewt Gabe
PLAYER UNKNOWN S BATTLE GROUND REVIEWWHY IT IS SO DAMM GOODi quite like the fact that its not limited what you are able to do with this game for youtube and twitch sake you are able to double dip beacuse this game wants you to see and share the over all experince its not one of those LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  games that does it for the money beacuse PUBG is really caring about the players if you have a problom just submit it and the operators of the game will fix it also ive only had one problom with this game and that is when you tab out of the game and then go in again your mice is unsyncronized so you have to press a inch below the thing you wanna click but all in all its really good experience it got that battle royale and H1Z1 system but in ultra realistic quality i really look forward to the full game i pre viewed all the goodies thats about to be added in the closest future and i could only recommend this a 100 percent but i would like to see smaller maps for newbs so we have a little play grounds for children  ish  beacuse i also came in late and really just got 1 kill after alot of hours but then i learned to get more and my record is 4 ive gotten that 5 times now and its pretty fun i could recommend it to eny1 and ive recommended it to some people already
U NEED FIX THIS GAME BEFORE U SELL SOME CHEST  NEED MORE OPTIMIZED LAG ISSUE AND RENDERING ISSUE
Negative reviews are over micro transactions that give you no advantage in the game I think i have about 80 hours and ive enjoyed every second of it If you enjoy battle royale its the best option righjt now
This game is honestly a smoking pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Inbetween the brokeness of the game the desync and the hackers its just too much If there were just hackers it d probably be an alright game or if it was just the fact that vehicles hit invisible walls and then make you triple somersault to your death then it d be an alright game But its the fact that we have a broken game dysnc that makes instances like jumping over a railing to avoid death and then dying because the guy shot the railing you d just been at or the hackers who in extreme instances headshot you from across the map or more commonly snap to you and blow you away with any gun when they aren t even looking at you Don t get me wrong its a fun game But with all these outstanding issues there is no way that I can continue to play this absolutely garbage tier game We deserve a game with the complexity of PUBG but with the performance of Fornite Perhaps someday we ll get that game this is most definitely not it
i love it 
I ve got about 75 hours into the game but I m liking it The incredible tension during the final 3 circles the absolute limitless ways to play and the map detail all make it vey enjoyable Sometimes there s a delay in joining a server but it s never been for very long  for me anyway on North American server I m happy with the 3900 I spent for PUBG
I love this game i have nothing else to say  D
decent game but DO NOT BUY the developers are untrustworthy and already trying to make as much money as they can without any official releasse in sight devs promised no microtransactions until the game had released unfixed bugs and glitches are expected but they also run the servers through the cheapest hosting company dont trust the developers until a full game is released
Fantastisc Battle Royale game
Every other review that came out today   Wh people can pay money to get skins  You can get skins by just playing and none of the skins give you a large advantage as the starting gear is relatively camoflauged anyway and the game itself is a great rush and perfect for a student like me allowing to play a round and then going back to studies without a feel of dissaray and urge to return I large recommend
The latest Update screw the game I gt 50mbps internet speed and I was ensure with no other appliacation or device using my wifi but it show i beeing detected for having a bad internet speed I was like wtf and the message hold my screen for a while and i decide to leave the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game due to I surrounded with couple of player and there was no point for waiting the screen back to normal game mode Please fix your update it wasnt helping me at all
Don t listen to all the recent negative reviews made by mindless idiots The game is good In fact it s been my favorite game since BO1 on the Xbox 360 The game play is so solid you can either play passively aggressive or something in the middle It s up to youThe flooding of recent negative reviews is due to Bluehole releasing Micro Transactions  MT after stating they wouldn t until the game fully released But to my understanding these MT aren t to be pocketed by PU the money is to be put directly into the development of the game we play and enjoyIt s not even like these MT change anything about the game either It s an assortment of different clothing Not advantageous weaponry Not overpowered armor Simple clothing for those who like to play dress upThese fools are attempting to kill a game because they re mad Bluehole made an addition for the game and the game only whether or not they broke a promiseNow if they do include weapons or anything similar to the crates I will be changing my view on this game and the company as a whole but so far clothing doesn t effect my thoughts on this amazing game
I don t get why people down vote this game just because of small micro transactions that just affects character apparel and nothing else The best fun with this game is if you are playing with friends solo is good if you want fast battlepoints for buying in game crates 1110 would buy again
FIXXXXEEEE THE GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I GIVE A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  FOR EMOTES
Fun but LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  microtransaction in a bugged early access game
The devs promised there will be no microtransactions until the game is finishedbanning people for stream sniping without real proof
This is a great game that gets better every single week At least since the introduction of first person only servers this is my most fun to play game right nowAlso thanks Bluehole for trying to keep this game clean and banning stream snipers glitch abusers and other cheaters F ck them
This is a truly great  albeit sometimes frustrating game  The devs have shown a commitment to improving and enhancing the experience It is a great feeling to get yoru first victory  Hoping that the exit from early access will bring better optimization and more consistent server performance but those things are expected in early access Great game great to play with friends
great game fun and intense especially when playing in a group and first person don t mind the negative reviews their all about microtransactions for skins has nothing to do with the game shrug
Good game to screw around in as well as be tactical and serious Would buy again
broken promise of introducing microtransactions
This game is outstanding One of the best early access games I have played yet It has a Hunger Games type feel to it and is super addicting to play 1010 would recommend to everyone
This Game Depends on ping soooo much and there is no middleastern servers i always suffer and hell sometimes i can t even open doors once a server is placed in Dubai or the Middle East I will edit this review An Update Still there are no Middle eastern server and the official game is just bad in everything servers aren t working guns are slow graphics are so vibrant yes they did improve the FPS but the game feels like its running on a heavy load and it just doesn t feel smooth With the new crapy servers i can t open Doors or pick up anything before pressing F 25 Times
30 is a good price for this game I enjoy it have had a great time playing with my friendsAs it currently stands the developers have decided to focus on microtransations before they even have a smooth bug free experience The microtransactions introduced involve unlocking crates that you must purchase with in game currency  BP that is gained from competingwinning games you cannot open these crates unless you purchase a key  currently 250 If you re a player who doesn t want to spend 250 for a one shot gamble of getting a vanity item that may or may not help or hinder other players  ability to spot you across the battlefield there s currently no tangible achievements for winning gamesI feel like Bluehole and Playerunknown have a good thing here they are the first mover in a genre that they get to define from here on out If they carry on the way they re currently heading and neglect to reward their players for playing rather than solely locking content behind paywalls I cannot recommend this game we re not even out of Early Access and they re already getting greedy I m losing faith that Bluehole and Playerunknown have what it takes to build a great relationship with their communityGive it a go if you have some friends to play with or wait for the next clone that does it better and offers freemium content similar to the Overwatch loot boxes
left Early access while provding better performance new map and more fun for friends and I
Best game I have played in a while
It s really fun with friends and is a really polished game even at this stage  I would ve written this sooner but I m not one to leave reviews usually  EDIT   Now that they re introducing keys and are planning on removing free crates all together after specifically stating that there wouldn t be any paid content until the game s release I can no longer recommend this game Sure the gameplay is fun but they re using the game as a cash grab It s unfortunate but it s happening
This is the fined tuned version of H1Z1 King Of The Kill and is getting better by the second as the fan base explodes and more updates come out this wll surly be a hell of a game As an update to this review PUBG should win a steam award for not only being a great game but also that it toppled CSGO and many other valve games in a few days of release
very fun gameplay style
Disregarding bugs of an ovious early access game I love this This game has me comming back to play it over and over iregardless of how much i loose or get annoyed The crate system is fine with me since it has two sides and honestly cosmetics mean nothing Thats how a game continues past the launch day as well as testing is what earlyu acess is for So everyone else stop your whining nothing is hurting you or forcig you to buy
gd game m8
Im only writing this becuase of the overwhelming amount of people buthurt about microtransactions If the devs introducing microtransactions is all you care about then dont get the game Saying that this game is really fun to play and definitly worth your money
Connected Waiting for response
who the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  puts burst fire on a kriss vector  dumb feature010
Despite some problems lags and bugs  Note that this still is only Early access and they update it every week or so this is one of the best games I ve played so far Because of how passionate I am for playing this game I even wrote this review and I never write any reviews I most surely recommend this game to anyone that likes big action and a few stressful moments in the end of the  round    Keep up the good work and work on those updates we all need we support this game and you developers   
Good gamemany bugs
You will spend half of your precious time trying to connect to the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game servers PUBG is the most played game currently and the dev can t afford a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing OK server to rent Blue Balls for the win
Good at beginning but startng to really doubt thier abilities with the server issues they have right now If you have this high volume of players you ought to be able to support the servers

I recently get always kicked out of the game When I have good loot and it is about mid game I get kicked out for no apparent reason This issue needs to be resolved As a matter of fact I deinstalled this crap LOVE LOVE LOVE  game becuase of it I have played it for about 108h And before the  great 10  I never got kicked out LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  BLUEHOLE  AND LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOU BATTLEROYAL GOD
cheater report simulator
Nice creates Dont buy this game is full of lags You will lose money and your nervus But here is creates    die from cancer pls 
8 man squads are a fun step in the right direction
1 They break a promise 2 I cannot play the game because of lag
Ever get that feeling someone is watching  well when that feeling goes away you get shot in this game 1010 would get spooked again
Such an amazingly addicting game
Game was alright before release Many promises were made regarding modability that are clearly never going to be delivered Then the swarm of hackers from a certain region arrived and I totally gave up
Honestly the gun mechanics of this game is insane and doesnt need more developmentone of the main problems that i encounter on the daily is the buggy UIAs for cheaters i very rarely encounter those as FPP has lessThis game is really going somewhere with the developments and new stuff they add
Is ultimately a very very fun game I don t have many hours but I just can t stop myself from thinking about playing it It is great to find some friends to play with and really makes the game that much better I think that 30 could be an iffy price to pay but if it goes on sale it is a must buy
es fun
this game crashes whole LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing time LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  developer LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers
dont buy if u dont have the newest and best pc parts there are coz playerunknowns doesnt give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about people who cant afford new GPUs
The game is fun But stop with the bad microtransactions
My pc may not be able to run it but I still get all the winner winner chicken dinners    cool emoji
The game is going to be H1Z1

So they want to test micro transactions in alpha game by selling key for  2 euros  That s a scam We payed for alpha version 30 euros and now they re trying to make more money from crates  before finishing game Bad move really bad move They didn t listen to community so now they ll suffer from bad reviews which will cause lower saleWhy so greedy 
It was a great game to start with but then devs decided to follow nexon blizzard and valve s path of cash destruction Its sad to see gacha system even in a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  gun game  looking at you overwatch Tera devs should know if they need more money they can start selling swimsuit dlcs I was happy about the loot crate system rewarding players for continuously playing but the random paid loot crate that has been infesting the game these days will never stop TLDR play if you have 3 other friends to play with otherwise its just another battle arena game like h1z1
realy nice game  
great game keep up the good work Bluehole
Great game very addictive a bit harder to aim at first  till now need more hours of practice
   bluehole you son of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  your shabby servers i want to get my money back
the game is fun  there are many babies on here complaining about a totally optional feature that doesnt break the game balance and are only down voting because the have some sort of moral justice code that must be fufillled even though it dosent effect there game play thiey will have u belive this is the worst game guilty of the worst crimes all while they sit back and log on every day and have funTHE GAME IS FUN
I dont recommend simply for the reason the devs broke there promise of no paid content till the game completed
Nice microtransactions This game is turning into trash with this Why not fix the issues with the lag the optimization and the hacking  Maybe balance the guns make it better Quit trying to take everyones money LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  your micro transactions
Everything about this game sucks Everything The performance The netcode The foundercompany The terrible movement the UI the vehicles the bullet penetration system etcPeople only play this because there is no alternative  aside from a cartoony game with minecraft eque build systemIts a frustrating existance
Ok before you let all the recent negative reviews deture you from trying this game I d like to clarify some things about the game and the devs decision to add microtransactions Yes it s an early access title so as expected there are issues however they not only add new content every month but they fix bugs and issues that are reoccurring every patch I personally admire the direction this game is going and how the devs are using early access to listen to the community and what they want with the game and how to fix it The devs also don t plan to keep the game in early access for years much like many indie titles we ve seen in the past and have been keeping to a set release schedule  does change sometimes for a couple days occasionally if the update isn t finished as well as an official release date that they will try to hit to the best of their ability To knock the game and the devs only on the basis of adding a temporary   1   2 months micro transaction to help them fund a tournament as well as support charity is wrong While I don t support the decision entirely as they did promise to not add micro transaction untill the official release the game content and the devs on this game are golden Like I said the case is temporary and they won t be releasing any more paid contents until release this allows them to test systems for the release of the microtransaction system Plus this is purely cosmetic and doesn t change gameplay much if at all If you don t like the paid content dont buy it don t leave a bad review complaining about a minor temporary addition that goes back on one promise made the game is still good and improving and the devs are loyal to the community The devs will hear your cries with or without the reviews In conclusion I disagree with the addition of the microtransactions partially as they did go back on a promise and many indie titles before now have caused many gamers pain from crashing the hype train and mistrust between the devs and community can ruin a game However adding the groundwork now and testing the pay system will allow the games paid cosmetics and such to be better at launch and it is only temporary to fund a gathering for the gamers who love the game and would like to compete with others who are also passionate about the game Plus some funds will go to charity the two combined reasons slightly outweigh the negative in my eyes
seems like streamers are gods and connet be killed otherwise youll be banned last week i couldnt play because of that
I do not recommend this game at this time On top of all the issues that have made it a real hassle just to play The net lag makes it so half your shots that hit don t actually do damage since on his end it has you missing after they fix these issues i will gladly give it 55 but as it stands now 25
This game is an actual piece of crap This is an excuse for a game In reality what you get is a great lag simulator with non rendering graphics and a piece of crap dev support This game is crap DO NOT BUY THIS it is a waste of money and time
Had such a simple yet enjoyable game only to get ruined Way to go creator now if someone else comes out with some thing sort of the same every gamer on here will jump ship fix your bugs then introduce new things don t introduce new material that is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Also respect this community as we will turn a blind eye to you pretty quickly
Excellent BR game  possibly THE best BR game out there and a FANTASTIC development team Is the game buggy  Yes are the errors slowly being fixed yes and most importantly above all the game is really fun I d say give it a shot ignore the haters and find out why this game has been so successful thus far
I attempted to play this game on 3 occasions In 2 games I was subjected to extreme lag   rubber banding on the 3rd game I was discconected from the serverThere is no option to see server ping or packet loss I suspect the reason being is that severs are 1500ms    packet loss is at least 50  at all timesThe developers are purported to be attempting a fix for this   this rreview may change on completion of these changes Nov 2017 Update  Review remains negative the game is plauged by haxors now and basic game fundemintals including ping latency indication are still not avalibleThe devs have also allowed players to use custom skins and reshade mods which have killed this game as a competitive platform
If you buy the game make sure you dont kill any streamers or else you wont be playing muchAlso the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  And instead of fixing it they introduce new weps
haha lol
WInner Winner Chicken Dinner
   
Having 400 hrs in this game means I m not tottaly crazy about this game but I have a decent opinion about it    Personally I don t agree with the ones who compare it to Fortnite Even if it s still a BR game Fortnite has a more arcade ish feeling to it whether you like to admit it or not PUBG on the other hand is more realistical  not completely and you get to put much more effort into playing it    I enjoy it a lot even though it has some major issues like  Constant lack of working anti cheat  the servers aren t full of hackers as some say but there are enough of them Servers aren t always working at full potential which means you have to refresh UI everytime you disconnect from a game and after new updates is common for them not to work at all Vehicles are pretty messed up especially motorcycles   3 seaters too and I think they should try to fix the interactions between minor objects such as poles or lights because you can stack the vehicle in them and they would take continuos damage which leads to the vehicle exploding and you dying  this type of death also brings a lot of rage and usage of alt f4   About minor problems there are things like  Visual bugs where you see weapons combined or can t aim if someone s proned behind you Dying immediately if you exit a boat even if it doesn t touch you Taking lots of falling damage if your parachute messes up in some kind of building   I think these were all the cons to it but it would take a lot to tell you the pros about it and even if this game has some problems the fact that the developers listen to user feedback makes PUBG one of the best games out there 100  reccomended it to all my friends
Game needs alot of fixes and the important ones arent being delt with some people just cant play this game properly because of performance issuesUnless you dont have more than 16 GB or Ram  or an SSD i do NOT recomend this gameFar beyond the  System requirements  of the game presented on store page
broken promises
Absolutely love this game In my opinion this offers better realism and intense gameplay done better than Arma DayZ and H1Z1   Amazing active community well done to BlueHole
This is definetly a great game i suggest you buy only bad thing is that if u dont have a 1060 graphics card or above u will only be able to run this game at 30 fps at medium settings
Install Fortnite its free and this is a pile of dumps
I was eating nandos while playing this
Monthly update Adds paid crates Games iz broken as hell I was It was PlayablePure disrespect for a community Plz hire some beta  testers before launching update which breaks game Pure LAG
Review after 150 hours Let me start by this I dont get why people so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hate the  microtransaction  thing Most of them are like  Your promise was lie  First I was little angry too but after devs explained it I am fine with it To be honest who the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  would thought that the game will become so popular and literally nothing goes to devs pockets Other thing is that people are constantly crying that instead of cosmetics they want new stuff There is new update every week and BIG update every month and if you didnt get the memo   Dev team is really small like super small for this big gameIf this is not enough for you to stop crying go play other  great  early access games  where devs promised LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of content and it never happened  COUGH   COUGH    Ark DayZ H1Z1 Conan and other  COUGH   COUGH And now the actual reviewPros   Really great game to play solo or with friends  If you have any  It is fairly competitive or you can go full casual and just enjoy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing around  Guns have really amazing sound and every single gun feels good  For me its pro for some no BUT cars physics is really funny  Stay away from motorbike if you dont want to risk dying  Really big gun arsenal  You can choose where you want to land  You dont need to kill anyone to be in top 10 or you can go nuts and kill everyone  Difference in armor or helmet not that big if you play smart  You can win without even shooting once  REALLY hard  Updates   Weekly smaller one Monthly bigger oneCons   Poor optimization You can run the game really good on low details but really bad on Hight so dont expect stunning graphics  It can get repetitive sometimes  Circle can LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you up really hard sometimes and you need to run 70  of the match  Really frustrating and if there is open field in late game and you are unlucky you have 80  chance to lose  ALWAYS Have some smokes  Push back lag on start of the game sometimes It goes away around mid gameNeutral stuff   Shotguns   Never fight shotgun in close combat It is really frustrating to get 1 shot sometimes  You can get easily between 2 enemies so watch out  Sometimes you will get 1 shot by sniper in head   If you want challenge try playing with crossbow It 1 shots to head every helmet in game
Early Access so theres obviously  gonna be bugs here and there optimization is meh  Improving on each update Gun mechanics are great  imo Car physics are OK  updated car physics yesterday Overall though i recommend this game heavily direct upgrade from h1z1 KOTK despite how early access it is compared to h1 First person mode servers are amazing optimized to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  first person servers have terrible optimization however they are beta sooo game attracts campers and first person mode  is meant to fix that Recommended
Was almost an enjoyable game I played it once with a friend that I had bought through my steam wallet He made fun of me and called me a neck beard I then tried to purchase his love by buying one of the new crates however I only got slacks He will never return my calls now010 would not waste my money on this game now that you have to spend 250 for a pair of virtual pantsActual gameplay is pretty solid Would rate obiwan out of highgroundStop making people spend money on crates filled with trash you made enough by selling the game for 40
Personally I find most of the  hate reviews  telling people to not buy this game sad to see Regardless of if they said they wouldn t add micro transactions or not doesn t matter They re a business and will attempt to make as much money  as they can And most forget to mention that the vast majority of content is free and they aren t forcing you to buy anything nor is it a pay to win scheme They ve been great about transparency over developement of the game and very good about keeping up with updates for the game So for me I ll keep playing and recommend you buy it if you enjoy this type of game If you like to complain about the minor issues then avoid as this is an early access game still being developed
I cover the specs but the optimization cant get past 30 40 fps
micro transactions
Blueballs entertainment has got the worst developer team in existance They cant fix LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  youre game is broken as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and now you even dare to make the statement that you can t push out weekly patches because it is too much work 
I wasn t going to review the game but the recent LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that has happened is kind of forcing me to want to share my opinion For starters I think the gameplay itself is a blast However with every new update there seems to be more and more issues First there was server lag that plagued most of the user base Now there is constant stuttering and frame drops The door and sound bugs aren t exactly every person s dream either Normally I would just assume it was just my computer since I would consider mine about a mid range pc But with all the complaints on reddit and watching one of my friends have the same problems on a pc much much better than mine it s getting harder and harder to justify recommending the game to someone And as the cherry on top the fact that the developers are going back on their word about microtransactions and dropping the ban hammer so willy nilly is making me lose way more respect for the company itself If they can fix the most recent issues and create a more community centric model for their company I will gladly eat my words and start recommending the game again
the game is fun but even strong machines struggle to run it and im not certain the devs are up to the task im almost certain they arent   try it before buying family share or something
every update they break the game where its unplayable but i still like this game and  would play it once they fix it
Last night I found out that my wife is going out of town all weekend Spent this morning messaging people and planning an all weekend pubg fest and then I see this I m about to start ugly crying at my desk Sending thoughts and prayers for a quick recovery
Fun as all hell Don t listen to the haters they whine over whatevers popular to whine about at the moment Used to be microtransactions now it s hackers Wha wha wha cry babies
This game can be very funIt is a slow pace and a fast pace game at the same time You can go very far by doing nothing or you can die early by trying to do to muchDuo is my jam thats all i playi recomend this game to anyone who just wants to have funEdit  About to Win Network lagg Detected Then i get a timeout and don t win this happens way to often when i am doing well Its not my internet 375mbps max and it drops to 315 averageA  lot of hackers right now
would shotgun people in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for loot crates
Even if you have a great PC this game refuses to run smoothly  FPS drops and raises constantly textures fail to load as you parachute to the floor I would say that the game isnt optimized or is running on a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game engine One of my most enraging gaming experiencesMy specs  8gb GTX1070 GPU 8gb RAM 330GHz quad core i5 550 Watt power supplyLet me know if you think it may be my specs
Every patch shatters performance especially the latest FPP patch The game verges on unplayable due to this reasons include  Network lag detected   because I dont have a SSD to install the game on while waiting for textures to load in considerable frame drop while looting engaging in a firefight and even running around Not to mention the fact that they have lost all trust by including microtransactions in this update  breaking a promise made during development
I very much enjoy this game Even with the bugs the team is qucik to manage them With the slot machines are fine let people pay what they want too if you are gonna complain about that then just dont let people do what they want if you don t wanna buy it then don t but over all its a great game to play very addicting over 200 hours on it I got every penny back from what i spent on this game
RRRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLL
Not optimized at all Git gud If you want to play a good survival game play DayZ
i mean its pubg go in with thinking about the game as  pubg  and you wont be disappoint
120 Rounds  0 Wins1010 would lose again
its very good BUY IT
Its good plus there constantly optimizing it fixing bugs and adding few features etc better than H1 imo
Its the best game of its kind but that is only because there really arnt many games like it on the market its a great step into the genre Similar to the rise of hero fps shooters following Overwatch following the success of the royale genre i can gaurentee that several battle royale games will follow pubg starting already with Fortnite The game is very fun especially when playing with friends but its extremely inconsistent laggy desync and a fair number of hackscheaters  but not often enough to ruin the experience If you like competitive fps games id reccomend but keep in mind it needs tons of more polish and development time to really be CONSISTENTLY fun and enjoyable From the pace that the developers have set i cant foresee this game every being polished to the point of a game like Overwatch or even Fortnite but hey i could be wrong It s more likely that another developer will take the battle royale genre and do it right like Blizzard did with a Hero shooter  PUBG is the team fortress to Overwatch and that next game im looking forward too
Awesome choice over csgoAlso a note for people with slow internet bandwidth THE UPDATES THIS GAME RECEIVES ARE HUMONGOUS
Fantastic game butM I C R O T R A N S A C T I O N S S H I T    S E R V E R S C H I N E S E    V P N     S C A M S T R E A M E R    B A N S U E I N G    U N R E A L      R O F L  refund and never buy this trash
this game is great alot of fun and addicting but you need a very good pc to run i have a gtx 1070 i5 6400 8gb ram and sometimes it drops to 20 30 fps on meduim seetings but most time 45 60 fps  alot of glitches i know its early access but still for the price worth it but kust rememver you need a extremly goood pc to run bye
Devs actually listen to community but the game community is full of controversy the reality  One of the best games to be released in a long time plenty of bugs and badly optimised but if you have a PC that can cope it s the best game out at the moment
i highley reccomend this game u may rage but it is fun when u win
Awful Was better in Early Access I ve played the game twice since it released and its progressively gotten worse compared to early access
it is very entertaining
I will say this  If I can spend hours on end playing a game that is not full releaseyou know it will be a hit
 Start Game Find good equipment Drive buggy around for 20 minutes looking for people Run out of gas Get out of buggy and immediately get sniped Smash keyboard Repeat
I really think thios game is great and it got a good future ahead of it But i wish the game was more optomized I got a good pc but i only run it at 80fps when i should be getting around 140 150 So thats the only downside i have about the game Also that fps is at low settings But overall i love the game and can t wait for the future of it
so fun guys if youre  gamers so buy it 30  its nothing for this game
THIS GAME IS FUNI AM HAVING FUN
Go into a house for looting even though you are pretty well equiped get the worst jumpscare you have experienced in your life because there was somebody else laying down and started shooting at you so you start jumping and shooting like a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  monkey and then die Rinse and repeat 1010 would die again
fun game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimization LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game srsly
It s pretty fun It actually requires a pretty decent CPU but not too powerful of video card The game allows for a lot of different playstyles you can drop somewhere that there is a lot of people or you can be more steathy and make it close to the end a lot of times I would prefer if it was a bit more unrealistic like CS with movement and shooting since I like a more agressive playstyle but it is still fun
blue circle escape simulator
Step  1 after you landed find a weaponstep 2 You see one with rare Mini skirt  Purple for 400step 3 Kill one throw away all your clothesstep 4 take Mini skirt  Purple And now you can run around like a rich mudder fu ker 1010

this game is utter cancer game doesnt work properly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
one of the best  games out therebut if microtransactions come its gonna be the biggest LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out there
Finally a battle royale game that is looking like it s going to be a finished product and even though it s not yet this game is one of my favourite online multiplayer games that i ve ever played I ve never experienced the heart pounding thrill in a game like you get when you re one of the last few alive at the end and even when you loose  most likely a lot you will just want to jump straight into a new game If you dont want a game that may be a bit buggy then wait for the final product but I could not recommend this game highly enough
Microtransactions are for vanity items that affect gameplay in no way A portion of proceeds are going to charity as well don t let microstransactions dissuade you if you are interested in the game These people just want to find something to get riled up and offended about

Microtransactions in an early access game
its kind of good
Meh It s over hyped with streamers and twitch
Too much hacker and cheater
GET LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ED LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Best Early Access game I have ever played and one of the most thrilling and fun gaming experiences a person can ask for I have quite a few frustrating but fun early access games under my belt and when I bought this I thought this would be a rough ride out the gate it was fairly polished and has only gotten better since then They have announced free maps and have largely been pushing out quality patches with some big monthly improvements as well The game can be thrilling in a solo run because it is you against all the other players on the map It is constant tense moments a ton of failure and then that sweet chicken dinner The game really shines in duos or squads  if you don t have a good group I would suggest at least going to discord channels to find people instead of randoms Playing with buddies in the game makes the game more dynamic and flat out fun You can play cover better to revive a dead teammate and can actually pull off flanks with cover fire to get the enemy out of position Once again frustration and failure all lead to that euphoric clutch kill that earns your team a chicken dinner The communitylike most large shooter communities it is toxic On reviews it is lets whine about the latest  drama  or lets be surprised it is a company that makes money and is selling cosmetics that offer zero in game advantage Most of them don t talk about the actual game they just leave a negative review because the company hurt their feefees Half the time they even say great game yea no LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it is a great game the rest of the review should be about that an how quick it is being polished and adding content not this other nonsense Finally if you buy this game and have a heartrate monitor use it for the final circles and be amazed at how amped the game can get you as a player Not many games can tell you right at the start of every match you will most likely lose and still be considered this much fun
Looks like something from a decade ago Still runs like absolute dogsh itIt s an early access title Still they ve increased the games pricing from 20 to 30 bucks after the hype
Love everything about this game Until they put the final circle in cities like WTF     I lost because the sudden death circle killed me while the camper in the house didn t have to fire a single shot stupid update if a circle is in a city I will automatically be leaving the match 910  1 for the final circle city update
Great game  It has its bugs but they are working those out  Definitely worth the buy in price
Good game made unplayable by cheaters high server ping and glitchs
Just addictive  I have never been interested in 1st person shooting but the realism in the 1st person mode is amazing  I am terrible and just don t care  Good times
BANNED and didnt even cheat
The idea is great but LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  me this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing terrible Always lagg high ping creating an 8 man game mode but you gotta play it with randoms XD Needs alot of improvement
Very good game Lots of hours Much fun
It is a ok game I don t understand all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it is getting same as I don t understand why Fortnite is getting gloryfied for  But meh I give it a  underapriciated but gloryfied 10
PUBG   Fortnite
h1z1 still cant have spectating you can jump out a car and take no damage and you cant do anything while you reload PUBG 9001  better than LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  h1
This early access game is a lot of fun to me I don t care about the crates drama BS let idiots buy cosmetics and finance the game while you enjoy other new content PR by Bluehole has been disastrous but it s not a big deal to me either THIS GAME IS GREATNah the biggest issue I have for now is that it runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  The recommended hardware  on Steam is completely inaccurate and you need a high end pc to get to  60 fps at all time But wow look at this elitist right here I play at 30fps and it s fine  you might say   No it s not fine If you want to do good in most games but especially in a shooter you need 60 fps or more Heck below 60 even gives me headachesI planned to refund this game after testing the framerate and this is exactly what I did However I m almost certain the majority of the playerbase doesn t have the pc to runs the game smoothly and I m also almost certain most didn t refund And this is making me sadIf you want to do good in this game and IF YOU DON T HAVE STEADY FPS REFUND IT They need to optimize the game before you buy it Not the overway around   don t buy now and hope they optimize later
Most fun I ve had in a long time Heart races unexplainably fast when it s just you and the last guy left It s a beautifull game but is a bit unoptemized New content with constant updates to game The only early access game I will buyJust buy the game You ll have fun
You need a key to open a crateNice promise devs
Maybe the best BR game there is great fun with friends
This game is reccomended 45 this game is enjoyable with friends or notif you want to enjoy dont care dying in this game just enjoy and kill somebody LOL this game is worth IT when you just know how to enjoy
After almost 100h of gameplay I can sum it upPositives  best battle royale on the market highly recommended for cooperation looks nice on ultra but not as good as it looks in steam videosscreenshots weapon customization and user interface is very intuitive  big and nicly done mapNegatives   unstable random drops freezes and connection issues  bad optimalization   SLI not supported  user interface in main manu  graphics options should be more adjustable  for example  DX version  based on luck30 is enought for this game It will give you much fun and satisfaction especially when played with friends But get ready for typical earle access isues PUBG has very big potential and if developed good can take this franchise to the top
Defiantely a game offers a challange and rasies the heart rate works really well with friends
Great game by all means Easy combat easy menu fast in   out games good graphics FUN Needs more content maybe or at least more weapons to make it less repetative  loot box things are coming Why  Nine times out of ten we switch to diffrent pants or gear when we find it and even if there are new hair styles they will just be covered by a helmet while mid match  Needs some more optimization for better frame rates on diffrent kinds of PCs  Gotta fix the mouse modding so people can t shoot the m16 faster on single fire than full auto  Guy emptys a 40 round clip in three seconds hitting every hit while others cant hit the broad side of a barn at timesSmall nitpick  Why are Chinese and Russians on NA servers  Had a dude screaming  FAK O FAK O CHINA NUMBA WAN  in the plane before the game at least three timesRating 7510   Needs more umff and less languages on NA serversEDIT  For some reason the servers keep getting worse lag wise I don t know how or why but it started after the newist patch Also I did find out about the promise for microtranactions to be later when the game was release which is a big fat lie Score is now lowered to a 610 and I do not recommend the game due to lies
This game is like Hunger Games meets 7 Days to Die You feel like you re getting really good until something comes along at an alotted time and pushes your butt in 1110 though Amazing idea
Care more about streamers than the players
The Asians are so bad xD
Amazing Battle Royale game Great for a challenge and a really fun game to play I thought it would get boring evertime I died and went into a new game but once you win it s all worth it even if you re on a losing streak it s a game that gets your heart racing everytime
This game is ridiculously fun I haven t been this addicted to a game since middle school
2  skill based98  RNG based
This is my third time editing my review of PUBG The other versions have both been negative but these days the future of PUBG has started to look better A lot of glitches have been fixed and the whole game is just feeling betterAs an example the new weapon skins have added some nice extra content also new scopes and the SLR are pretty niceAt the moment i can already recommend to try the game because its not so broken anymoreThere are still some moments when it feels like the enemy you are shooting at doesnt take any damage but it is just sometimesSo my opinion on PUBG atm is pretty nice its not fortnite
Pretty fun in my experienceMostly fun when you play with friends whom are good at the gameCan decribe it in one word  Meh  Some people might like it more than me though like my friend who s a broccoli Have fun playing Female dog
I m following the trendThe game is stupidly funny
ok i love playing this game to death BUT this game is so broken i have a 960m not a great card i know but this game can t even open up sometimes the game freezes constantly textures don t even rendered when i hit the ground causing me to  die from other players becuase i can t open a damn door  and the crashes oh for the love of god the crashes if i had a dollar for everytime this game has crashed on me i would have 20  30 dollars and everytime it crashes i have to hard restart or shut down my laptop just to get out of the game and now you re talking about micotrasactions gtf out of here  Please I love this game hell this was my first survival game that i ever played but for the people who made this game please FIX YOU LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME i m getting furious having to shut my laptop down everying LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing time
very good addictive game love it
Fine
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you developers because you have made millions and millions off of sales alone and instead of adding optimization and bug patches you add skins and microtransactions a thing you said you wouldn t even do
PLAYERUNKNOWN S CAMPGROUNDS Still fun besides the bs camping Literally can t kill anyone when they re all in house s corners in 3rd person
Game is fun but i can t support it when they lie to the comsumer Expectionally over one of the most hated things in modern gaming being microtranstions
Landed found pants died 1010 would play again
If you got a buddy go school and win
hate early access
This Game Is Really Fun To Play But One Thing They Dont Mention Is That It Is Better With a SSD i Dont Have Ones And I Experince Many Issues Like Textures Not Loading In And Having To Press TAB Which Freezes My Game Its Not My RAM Or Anything Else Other Then That Amazing Game Has Alot Of Potentional
It will be a very good game but I have serious issues with the game thet cauzed my death sometimesI am talking about not rendering houses for the first half minute or not rendering rocks while you are driving or swimming in one place
By far my most favorite game to date The concept of always pushing players towards each other with the moving zomes is brillant Really fast paced pvp with a large amount of players what more could you ask for 2 thumbs up
Alright so this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed now so don t even bother
Sexually arousing
Great Game Definetly Worth 30
So this is a critical moment for PUBG theyre introducing microtransactions to open up in game reward creates They will either take the route of trying to suck their players dry or theyll realize theyre being dumb and stop it As for the game itself I cant help but same its fun can get a little old after a bit though but I go back for a game or 2 every few days
I r8 88 m8s
microtransactions inspired by their micro urethras
One of the most fun games there is Play in a massively huge map gear up and try to get to  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  at the number one spotThe only downside to the game is that you  in my opinion don t get awarded enough for winning And also there should be more unique   different custom items to get in drops  45
can anyone LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HELP ME i  dont get it my fps is always so low less than 20 its umplayable and i did everything ppl said to do and it slighlty worked but its my fps is still less than 40 i bought this game with so much exictement but i cant even play it please help me
Pros   External bullet ballistics   Highly addictive gameplayCons   Cheaters A lot of them  Cash grab business model Adding weapon skins instead of fixing bugs and preventing cheatingI can t recommend this game Close but no cigar
I like it They seem to know what they re doing A bit more casual than the ARMA mod but still has a lot of promise
I don t like being lied to still a good game but brace yourselves for dishonest devs
Awesome its a game about shooting and the middle of the map is a school coincidence  i dont think so i love it
 Let s take the main road it s safer  Killed 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t game not worth the money At all
A guy drove right into me and the jeep exploded We both died Middle East  10
I had high hopes in the developers thought they would honestly be better than the big companies and not f    with their playerbase After selling 5 million copies that cost 30 each they get greedy and implement microtransactions to milk people for even more money breaking their promise not to do so during Early Access Can t recommend it now
 Gambling is good because it works 
this game is amazing one second your driving a car next second the car blows up and everyone in it dies 1010 would not drive a car againbut in all honesty this game is amazing
Oh boy this one is one I didn t expect to be writing When I first bought this game about two weeks ago everything seemed great Death wasn t painful or annoying and the game despite it s incredibly potato tier optimization that strangles hardware that s been released less than 6 months ago was overall really fun for me and my friends and all seemed well but then everything seemed to change once that incident with the streamers happened so let s get into the nitty gritty of it  For the most part let s be clear here don t under any circumstances stir up a hornet s nest with a streamer To quote Total Biscuit  The reason PUBG devs are intervening on the streamer s behalf in  sniping  cases is simple Streamers are the main reason they were  are  successful Their priority is  to  coddle their gravy train protect streamers instead of tell them  use the tools you have yourself to fix this yourself In short  Streamers   Anything that negatively affects streamers   Next I paid for that  free  case system Did I specifically even think about that while purchasing it  Oh hell no Did I still pay to be able to use it as part of the game  Yes The fact that all free crates are going to be taken away and replaced with paid crateskeys in a game I paid 30 sheckles for is complete bullcrap and equivilent to me taking my car to the dealership for maitenence and getting it back only to find that all the cupholders have been locked with a coinslot with the shop s response to my outrage being  Just return your bottles for cash then use them to pay to open the cupholders     Some could say  Well hey the cupholders are completely optional and the car still works so don t complain  but I did indeed pay for the things so I should be able to use them shouldn t I Oh and I m not kidding about that last line  I wish I was everyone s favorite head dev litterally told people bothering him about that to just sell the low tier crates you earn from  presumably winning or getting a certain place or better to buy a key Yes those crates that you sell to get a single cent from after valve tax Given that the average key is apparently going to cost 250 USD a piece that means you ll need atleast 250  1 crates  that  1 being the one you open crates to get a  single  cosmetic piece out of 5 for a full set of whatever Doing some math here let s pretend you have to get in the top 50  or about half way through the match to get a crate With the average match being about 30 minutes or so you ll need to live for atleast 15 ish to get a crate 15 minutes x 251 crates  3765 minutes or about 6275 hours for a single random cosmetic item for the lowest tier Multiply that by 5 for a full set  assuming you have the luck of a god to win exactly one unique piece in that exact set in a rigged crate system and you get a whopping 31375 hours for a single set I shouldn t need to explain the nonsense of that in a free to play game let alone one I spent 30 USD onIn short  Taking things I paid for away and putting them behind another paywall  trash  Next let s talk about the optimization or lack thereof Sure I get it it s an early accesssteam direct game but when the minimum settings lower frames more than  mostly maximum settings do and the game is derived from another gameengine that s been on the market for several years now there s a problem Oh and it s not even a constant low fps it flops between highs and lows more than a certain uncomfortably short appendage that is held near and dear to meOne last thing on this  The game eats ram like a fat man in an  all you can eat  buffee so more is better All on in all it s utterlly dissapointing that a game with as much promise and as legitimately fun to play as this one is dragged down by yet another dev who sees money signs instead of faces in his fanbase all because he s hit the popularity lotto Mark my words it won t last forever
Seems like a lot of people is mad because they have introduced micro transactions about skins For me that have played this game alot don t really care about skins If you want to pay extra 250 dollars for key buy the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing key if you dont want the key dont buy the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing key dont blame the hard working gamedevelopers for both keep their jobs or the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing company for just answering the free market This isnt even a game where you need any skins if you want to choose skins without micro transactions and refuse to pay move to LA and suck some Political correct LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
999  miramar worst map ever hope they fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
tried everything   doesn t run for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i d wait until they patch this game more to buy it   they don t seem too bothered about fixing it for people who re having major issues with it like myself the game is almost unplayable due to the intense lag spikes buildings not rendering lag spikes during combat etc others may not have these issues but i d say just wait game is great but ruined by the bugs
This game is really fun The only problem is that I have low fps when playing and sometimes the houses don t load in at the beginning of the game But besides that I think I would recommend this game to all my friends
I wish i could give this game a hard dislike bluehole is trying to own the battle royale franchise The lawsuit against epic games is completely crazy and I will not put any more time into a game with such a horrid company running it
Overall the game is fun you might die a bit of times until you get used to it and more experience but again overall fun Most of the negatives I seen for this game is mainly about the new microtransaction thingy which doesn t seem to bother me becuase I just like playing the game don t care for the looks of my character Also the performance I ve seen that people don t like the performance especially people with lower end specs but the game is being patched monthly with better optimization new weapons and nerfing and buffering This game is pretty good game bound to be out done by a future game but probably not for quite some years Overall its not a Twitch trend it s gonna be around for a while so I recommend getting it 810 Peak Best when playing with friendsAlso I look forward to the new maps
i think it will be better if mid low spec pc can play this game too
a good game overall but tey dont explain anything i died 3th coz i didnt know that if there are 3 players left alive the zone kills you in like 6 sec they need to do a toturial 
Great game very addictive and fun This game is not for your average COD playersThe game takes immense startegyLuck in order to get those chicken dinners
Remove the fog it makes this game incredibly boring and 30 or more minutes of waiting and then randomly dying I just dc from all fog games because it takes out the fun of the game
Buggy runs poor and everytime I have to hard reset my laptop which leads to more corrupted files
What the heck   can t land the parachute  stuck in air for 20 straight seconds   gets slightly hit by car  loses 80  of health  hits a car doors with a pan from the outside  player inside loses health  hides behind wall in time  still gets hit by enemy  on death cam it shoots right next to the player  joins in 3 man match and gets greeted by 4 man squad in the middle of the game  how fair is that  not always can view my deathcam  make it so it shows straight away when player dies perhapsAnd you call this a full released game what a joke I hope Europa comes out soon and will present what real battleground looks like
Apart from the fact that the game gets boring after a few hours because there s only one mode   it runs like poop on my high end gaming laptop I can run any other game on the market on the highest settings but this gamestart up is slow loading is slow freezing is commonplace Nothing worse than having to stand around 3 5 minutes for buildings to load so you can go inside and loot them You re either going to die before the buildings load or you re going to be significantly behind everyone else Now I realize not everyone experiences these problems For some the game runs perfectly However with the massive amounts of money the devs are making off this game they should have the resources to fix these issues which a decent chunk of their playerbase appears to be dealing with When new modes are introduced and issues like the ones above are fixed   I ll change my review So till the game is optimized I do not recommend PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS
PLAYERUKNOWS BATTLEGROUNDS is a phenomenal game The Graphics are perfect the servers are even better It has been so fun to play
PUBG   H1Z1   DayZ
Love it very stratigic keeps you on you re toes an makes you hungry for that chicken dinner lol 1010 an it s only in ALPHA right 
DSYNC and server issues plauge this game Every month they say they have fixed an issue with performance and evry month t seems to get worse Nothing fun about blasting someone with a shotgun and point blank with no armor and watching blood fly everywhere then get two tapped by a pistol Check your dmg stats after and they say you did 0 dmg For the game to be  that far behind where you can see two shots connect then die and do no dmg to the other player that is a huge issue So instead of fixing it Bluewhole decides to start throwing things at there player base like skins and new maps and weapons Which is fine if all they er attempting to do is make some money But it looks to me like they are traveling down the same road as H1Z1 under the guise that they are different because they activly tweet out at the community and  listen  to them Look on the PUBG forum more then half of the comments are people asking for them to fix the server and DSYNC issues yet we get skins and maps For a game that is supposed to be fully released by the end of the year they are way off
The most buggy attrocity of a game I ve ever spent my time on It is absolutely awful you can barely qeueue one match without dying from glitches cheaters RNG circle LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t where you run along the road for 4km and don t find a single vehicle and are damned by the circle and car spawns from the moment you drop out of the plane It seems to have only gotten worse since launch and the dev s are now LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s who ban people for jack and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and jack left town Also microtransactions you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fake wanna be american AAA dev s
vss  okhand 
PlayerUnkown s Battlegrounds is a fantastic early access game I bought from day 1 On day 1 I bought it for myself along with 5 other copy s for my friends who I reguarly game with but who are a bit iffy about purchasing early access games due to being supporters of Day Z and Ark  Survival EvolvedI have played for 1755 hrs on record at the time of this review and have had loads of fun in the game It is a very skill based game with luck and zone positioning being key in winning any game Finding that rare sniper rifle or silencer can really get you excited for the win The constant fear of not knowing where or how many people are nearby makes the gameplay in PlayerUnnknown s Battlegrounds a worthy experienceHowever I cannot support an early access game or in my opinion any game that locks content behind the anti consumer paywall that is the microtransaction crate system I myself have spent over 150 USD on multiple copys of this game as I thought it was a great early access experience to be enjoyed by my friends and I It is very dissapointing to see this game still in early access breaking its promise to not include DLC content until full release DO NOT PAY FOR REAL MONEY KEYS Especially on a game still in development
banAssboy1Assboy3 1000 
iss lyyysssss
I team killed my friend because we were doing as joke no ban plz
First day playing its 5 24 am very addictive 910 boys
Better than Car 1 Z 1 1010 Probably one of the most addicting game out Rn
This game was fun until all this drama showing how unprofessional PU and Bluehole is regarding PR and obvious favoritism of streamers Also this game sold 5M copies on early access and still feel the need to have microtransactions in the form of locked cratesLiking this game less and less not because of the game itself but because of the devs that obviously don t care about doing things fairly and just throwing around bans without real proof and not willing to show what  proof  they have to anyoneOptimization is still bad
PanWinm4 pffffakm pfffm24 pfffffffawm its not evil funny It will not do any damage if you have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE en pandoes it work in real life 1110pans
why this game has always LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing update every days
FIX YOUR SERVERS SPECIALLY ASIAI LIVE IN ASIA BUT ITS LAGGY AF
This game is bad and here is the list of what you get from buying it  early game lag  hackers  China number one  unloaded texture  random weapon spawn bug  unable to pick up weapon eventhough you clearly stand over it  server always busyIf all of these are fixed than I would gladly recommend it
sick game especially FPP mode  P
I jsut don t know why i can t get in the game can you just fix your server please
Despite all those recent bad reviews I bought the game Haven t came across with any hackers nor bugs Actually it s pretty fun to play with your friends
Put change name just available once
Good gameplay if you can run it Lots of lag and still many bugs to work on for a released game
I would LOOOVVVVEE TO PLAY PUBG but I m unable to there is this bug where I d be stuck on the loading screen and unable to join the game sometimes I can hear me on the game and I can control it but I was still on the loading screen so please fix this bug and I can enjoy PUBG  So far I ve only gotten in 2 games
Ban all Chinese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s please Or make a new server and lock all chinese players to it   all you hear is  ciao ni ma  or  china numba wan  in auto matchmaking squad or duo and on the spawn island   half of the times I get killed by a guy named  jiang  or  xiao  or  chinano1  from more than 1km away with an AK EVERYONE IS HACKING  they can shoot you when you are behind a cover It s the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers too but these LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s make it worse with their 2000ms ping  i have been teamkilled several times in squad with random Chinese because they want my loot but they don t know how to ask for it
this game is actually terrible has too many bugs doesnt load doesnt work it s a hunk a junk
Great
Here it comes the micro transactions They promised there will be no microtransactions until the game is finished but yet here we are the microtransactions during Early Access in a game that already costs 30We trusted you and you failed usValue promises above all elsePS Game is dope btw RIP H1Z1
It s not H1Z1
awesome and getting better
adsf
great game always a different round when you play
This game makes me happy
Oops looks like these developers made the classic mistake of implementing microtransactions Another game getting review bombed because you keep shoving this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  down our throats
If you are not a big Twitch streamer or a YouTuber don t buy this game You will be treated like a s  t by the developersadmins I will review this game again after few monthsPros   unique playstyle  most adrenaline I got out of any game ever  funny moments with random people  voice chat included  relatively frequent patchesCons   slightly repetitive after while  bugs lags not much content  yes it s EA  admins banning people without evidence  developers broke promise of finishing the game before microtransactions
It s great there is some bugs and glitches and is a tiny bit clunky but I have had so much fun even in solo its more fun with friends but i would give this a good 810 would reccomend must buy 2017Edit the net code is worse the added microtransactios are bs and the ammount of banning is rediculouse also you can report user names come on really its a game where you fight to the death why are you conserned about user names Fix your damm game pleaseEdit full release and the performance is better but the game has crashed more for me and it lags alot more aswell
Never gave a bad review the first bad review LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  earned so much money the server is not optimized 3 times a day black heart developersPlease return the money to me
Originally i recommended this game as it was good but since the recent updates the game as managed to pick up quite a few bugs and optimization issues
Even as an early access game PUBG has been at least to me one of the best multiplayer experiences I ve seen to date While the game isn t ideally optimized for people that don t have slower computers or those with lower end graphics processors I m sure it will continue to get better as time goes on Even at 30 I consider this game an excellent purchase and would highly recommend it to a friend
every kill is skillevery death is hax
Good game  D
The game is fun but the devs are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  They don t care about the community and will enforce a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the rules of this game A random in your squad TK s your 2 friends and tries killing you  You get banned for killing him in retaliation Kill a player that s out in the middle of an open field after he shoots his gun  Get banned because that player was a big streamer and he cried  stream sniping  for dying Try to appeal your case to the devs  Get told that you shouldn t have done what you did and then get banned from their discord chat so that you remain silenced The devs are a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing joke
That moment when the servers are too busy feelsbadman
Very good game for more than 2 playersIt has some lag spickes but i think in the future this will be fixed
PUBG Is Quite Funbut the new mode is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  RETARD U Drop down on plane it cant even land the follow properly once we land down we died keep died and lose the match  this is so confuseing I Recommend to set a respawn place   so we wont died so easily or what  
Very addictive game 1010
This game is trash after so many months the developers are doing nothing to improve this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Frequent trashy server game crashing half way nice path to killing the game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bluehole Do u even play ur game        and still has time to work on the phone version
I really enjoy this game  but microtransactions during Early Access in a game that already costs 30 
   UPDATE 09082017   I was really pleased to see their response and apologies regarding their microtransactions All good everyone makes mistakes acknowledging them and doing better in the future is what it is all about So I went to play and encountered a bug which led me to another poor experience with this gameI put in a support ticket on 08142017 because my charachter was 5k BP in debt due to a UI bug So every game since and to this day  I am just earning payments to BP debt for past who knows how many games IE after a game I go from  53kBP to  51kBP how lame Their support basically let me know they cannot help me or adjust my BP and I have to deal with it So again to let people know  this game is fun but beware I still am leaving this game marked negatively due to poor support                             I don t normally take the time I should to review games but the audacity to introduce microtransactions with the game having many bugs currently which is expected in alpha state and completely go against their word of NOT introducing microtransactions in early access This is the type of behavior that makes sick after they got so much support from the community when the game had more bugs than it does now It is a real shame because I actually enjoy this game and will probably still end up playing it but I hope this review displays the distrust I have for these guys now and think it is extremely poor taste to request more money from us when they already have 100 million plus in revenue of support for a buggy ALPHA GAME HOLY   How about some FREE limited of time crates to show appreciation for putting up with all the bugs and poor server performance for monthsFAQ which also states no microtransactions prior to launchhttp forumsplaybattlegroundscomtopic25335 faqInterview with MR PLAYERUNKNOWN himselfhttp wwwgamasutracomviewnews297434quotSkin_economy_is_a_good_thingquot_says_Playerunknowns_Battlegrounds_creatorphp PS I love the idea of cosmetic microtransactions to support charities but you can fund your own tournament at this point The microtransactions may just the first thing they go back on their word and they are showing some serious greedSincerlyDissapointed
UPDATE  Looked into how much PUBG made so far well over 100M  US currency  ON AN EARLY ACCESS GAME        THEN THEY WANT MICROTRANSACTIONS FU PUBG or MICROSOFT since it is going to console by next yearI like the came so far but it definitely has its issues First I would have to say knowing that they are in early access and still going to impliment a microtransaction feature is STUPID You will only lose your original fan base and keep the ones that either don t mind paying to get their  cool stuff  then they LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  when they spent 250 on some bogus stuff Next seems like for the first 30 seconds of landing you have to deal with major lag  noticeable if you go into a housebuilding and try to interact with objects within that period  Last thing it is defintely way to easy to camp your way to top 10 and then pop out of the house to kill the final dude that probably  had to run around the whole game to get into the  safe zone  I know this because I myself have been on both sides of the spectrum Pros  best battle royal to date  IMO  100 players is the perfect amount to make it face paced but doesnt feel like you are in a huge warCons  Camping Simulator Waaaaaay too many pistolshotguns Not enough M16 AKM M24 etcConclusion  Ill still end up playing this game because GTA V has gone to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and CSGO has gotten old so ill play this til another game comes out or if the microtransactions LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on the game BEST OF LUCK PUBG   PUBG Players hopefully they do the right thing
Running Simulator1010
Very Good Game Fun With Friends
 Once Gamescom is complete on August 27th the Gamescom Invitational Crate will be no longer available and removed from the game We will then return to the free to open system  Game is freaking awesome People talking about Microtransactions during EA    ReadIt s an EA game they are testing the system before launch
REMEMBER EVERY REVIEW YOU READ FROM ANYONE IS AN EARLY ACCESS REVIEWBANNING I haven t had any issues with being banned from killing or even honking at a streamer as the player  gottkoenig dokapp  put in his reviewOne player  Weather Report   put it like this in his review and yes his tag is Weather Report   posted Sept 29  4 58pm In PLAYERUNKNOWN S BANNINGGROUNDS one player  you must find a way to make it to the end of a 100 man battle royale located in modern day Detroit without getting banned for killing streamers whether they are streaming or not Additionally if you choose to kill the guy that is team killing your squad you also get banned for team killing Get used to it hater Okay so I have as of writing this review 2771 hours of game time That s nearly 12 days I have friends that have double the time put into this game  Sir Reclaimer    3702 hours  Dr_Goodbeer    4813 hours and  stonaboy    5756 hours  non of them have experienced anyhting like that or have been banned In the time I have played I have never ran into any of these problems that  Weather Report  states expect one Before the actual in game reporting system was implemented I had a teammate kill me because of jealousy yes jealousy Oh and looting the building next to his that was appearently his building WTF  Anyways since the new reporting system was put in plaece I haven t had an issue I played agaisnt DrDisrepect the popular mustach mullet wearing streamer It was me vs DrDisrepect and two of his buddies I killed one of them and DrDisrepect and his last friend rushed me and killed me I didn t even know it was DrDisrepect until he had killed me I then went to his stream right after and saw my deathI was never accused of stream sniping nor have I been worried about it I honeslty think some of the people that were banned for stream sniping were actually doing just that and are now mad at the system for working I do also think that some may have been wrongfully banned But I have feeling that  Weather Report  is hiding something something that he hasn t told us that s making him so angry toward PUBG If banning for stream sniping is such a huge issue then why haven t any of my friend or myself delt with itNow there are some people out there that are being banned and accusing Bluehole for banning them for stream snipping without any actaul proof that that s happening Here is an example of a player doing just that at least he admits later he was wrong  Bat of Sealand  review   posted Sept 28  7 32am updated Oct 12  12 56am Apearently i am a stream sniper Someone who hasnt used twitch since 2011 I can t wait until this game dies then you can enjoy it without getting false bans because a streamer is awfulEdit  I later found out it was because of crashing when joining games still its a bad auto ban system and they need to improve it I have crashed many times while in the menu start of the game and while in game I haven t been banned for crashing but not every auto banning system is perfect Look at some of the AAA titles out there Of course most game developers understand that an auto banning system makes mistakes and they usually unban players after furthure review I do feel sorry for  Bat of Sealand  and i hope that he get is ban liftedOPTIMIZATION Sure the game has some optimization issues but the game is early access It has gotten better over time but think about this for a second If the devs of PUBG didn t add new things to the game like guns cosmetics and systems or even upgraded a few things like the mini map and banning system and focused soly on optimization so that it wouldn t take as much to run the game do you really think as many people would have continued to play NO some of the same people complaining about little stuff still would have complained that there is nothing new in the game REMEMBER THIS IS EARLY ACCESS and this team started off small and only gained traction later on so they need a little more time to develope the game I have a feeling there are some people out there with the minimum specs thinking that they will play the game just fine Medium graphic settings at 60fps well that s not the case Also go take a look at the October 3rd post for the Developers They clearly state what s been going on with the severs and it makes a whole lot of sense It s essentially the same thing that happend to Sony and thier PSN when the PS3 came out Sony wasn t expecting to get millions apon millions of new players on thier servers Samething goes for PUBG the Devs were not expecting the game to be a SMASH A HIT amoung players Their servers were intionally ment for 1 million players Since then the game has sold over 10 million copies probably more than that now So just remember that Bluehole is on it and they are working hard and that Microsoft is pressuring them to develope an Xbox version of the game as well PRICE One reviewer  NekoApocalypse  stated that he payed  FULL PRICE  for the game What do you mean full price Is there a half price option  It s a product and the company creating and selling it can determine the price You chose if you want to pay that price and if people don t buy the price goes down It s a nice ballenced system But I think that the 2999 price tag isn t bad at all seeing how much work they are putting into this game now  NekoApocalypse  does say and I quote   posted Spet 28  9 31am updated Spet 28  10 30am For those who do not understand what I m talking about I m a Chinese player and seemingly Bluehole get parterned up with some  game accelerator  software and put an ad ON THE LOBBY SCREEN  Basically a VPN software that makes you connect to the game fasterIt says  The only official accelerator of the game The ad appears only if you connect from China so it wouldn t be a problem for players elsewhere but why did Bluehole even approved this  They are already charging full price for an early access game and now they put ads in it What kind of developer do this  End qutoeDid you think that maybe the program used was a bit expensive for bluehole so they thought a small ad wouldn t be a huge deal seeing that PUBG is actually half the price of the usual fully devolped retail game As long as the ad doesn t appear in the middle of the game and get me killed I m fine with that MY LAST THOUGHTS My point is that I don t think people should be complaining as much as they are The game has mixed reviews because of people not looking at the bigger picture There are over 10 million of us all saying what we want to see next what we want to see upgraded added refined and Bluehole can t keep up but they are trying so hard It seems like some of us have become selfish and it s sickening I don t agree with everything that Bluehole has done but I have a feeling that its for the best even if I dont fully understand it yet I 100  recommend this game REMEMBER you won t always get your favorite gun you won t always get a kill you won t always make it to the top 10 and you sure as hell ARE NOT going to get a WINNER WINNER CHECKEN DINNER everytime But that s the fun part the challenge the excitement running out into the frey with a crossbow and frying pan and trying your hardest to get that kill the Chicken Dinner against all odds  and when you do you feel like a BEAST Reviews quoted by me are listed as  top hepful reviews 
BUGS  MANY BUGS
Bluehole screwed this game before it s final by doing microtransaction in Early AccessEdit  UPDATE 10 please put Early Access tag backREVIEW UPDATES 110 games you will killed by a cheaterI mean in 1 game you will be killing yourself because the server are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is going south pretty fast Starting with microtransaction in an EA game to banning random people from the game for 1 FULL WEEK for  streamsniping  without having any real evidence Just go read PUBATTLEGROUNDS reddit and you ll understand all these recent and justified downvotes As long as they don t fix their  I m superior you re a peasant  attitude they won t succeed any further They turned into an ignorant moneygrabbing  NoMan s Sky  like company
very laggy gameplay can t do anything but w8 until u die and repeat
First time writting a reviewThis game started out amazing with mass amount of potential and I couldn t stop playingBut now the devs are breaking promises attempting to cash in with microtransations which was promised not to happen during early access and yet its about to be introducedAlso it appears that the modsdevs are now banning players with no hard evidence This is something I strongly advice for any new gamer to this game please becareful a simple accidental team kill can get you banned no matter what  suggested by the devs don t queue with match making on Makes no sense if you wish to play a duo or squad game with some randoms and maybe make some new online friendsKilling a streamer can get you banned for  stream sniping I am sure other bans and broken promises will happen down the road but for now I can not recomand this gameBut with some hope I hope the devs will come back down to earth see the mistakes they are making and correct them in time before things get worse

It s one of those online games that i can see myself playing long term with hundreds of hours of playtime I think the game is amazing and it s some of the most fun i ve had in an online game in a long time Battle Royale is an amazing concept for a video game and this game does it the best Those rounds where you make it to the top 10 you feel this kind of tension that you have never felt in another game it s a great feeling and winning a game is even better There are some servers issues they need to sort out i wish the game was better optimised it doesn t want to use more than 50  of my cpu for some reason and they need to fix some the small gameplay issues like the driving physics The gunplay feels great the sound effects are on point i really like the map they created and i m keen on other maps released in the future It s one of the best coop games you can play too it s alot of fun with friends It s one of those games that defines the word cooperative because you need to cooperate with your friends in order to survive and win it s very well done
410 buggy asf and decide 2 add dlc
Play Dota 2 instead It is less buggy than this piece of trash
lag game
It s alright game played it a bit but not muchIt s fun once a week I guessAlready getting microtransactions so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that XD
promised no microtransactions before finishing the game now offering microtransactions before the game is finished  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bluehole
I used to love this game It was great balanced and fear inducing Now its a glitchy mess where sometimes you can t move but others can I have been killed on multiple occasions because I was unable to move I will not be playing again until they fix the broken and laggy movement and the unfair kills due to not being able to control my own god damn character If they don t I won t be recommending to others ever
Lagging in Asia server Indians and Nepalese don t buyYou will regret I can t get a refundBecause I was afk
If you don t have the money to waste DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I know its early access and you should expect fps lag and crashes thats all good and all but for people that have trouble saving money its not worth the 30 as of now you WILL DE SEED lots of times it will get you killed If you have the money to waste go for it but if not Do not buy this gameUpdate 2018    desync for days LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
This game crashes way to much to the point where it pisses you off
This game isn t any different from any other game in the genre   poorly optimized with janky game mechanics bad servers and soon to be added microtransactions
The developers of PUBG just announced they ll be doing a paid crate system after leaving Early Accesss Everyone should be disgusted by this In a game where you need to survive by blending in and staying hidden paid cosmetics matter If there s clothing that really mimics the colors of trees and buildings and this clothing can only be found in crates that s pay to win and that affects the entire playerbase by putting those that pay at an advantageI used to like this game a lot Now this is scummy Stay away if you hate predatory gambling boxes
This is one of the best games I have played in ages It is non stop exceitement from the second you look at the map to determine your landing zone til you are either killed which is most likely or you are the last man standing I have around 125 hours on record and will keep coming back for more for as long as I can tell The developers are also constantly making improvements All in all it s the best 20 bucks I have ever spent Give it a try and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do 1010
Rly you trolling that game so muchI dont want skins youd LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I just want to play which cannot fall down every single game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
AMAZING GAMEEEE
It Is A Really Fun Game But It is Very laggy and glitchyThe Only Problem i have with this game is that my graphics dont load and i have to wait about 5 minuits every game
dude this game is pretty good i can see why it s so hyped especially with friends this is an incredibly tactical experience and just a clowny ripfest
New Review I changed my Mind with this game besides the Money making part which sucks a little but they have to make money i guess    Always Remember to vote with your Wallet if noone buys the Keys they will disappear The Game is still buggy and crashes with the new Updates but they fixed the frames  GTX 970  AMD 8350 on 44GHZ running on Medium High at around 60fps Gameplay is nice especially in a GroupOld Review  The Publisher is going to make Money with Skins instead of pushing the bad Engine forward 
I really LOVE this game and enjoy playing it with my friends but with the update that recently released we can t even reach the main menu It keeps on saying that I lost connection while my WiFi works fine and this problem is not just for me but my friend too and his WiFi is way better than mine Please fix
best game of the year  D
Fix your pig servers you please iam so triggered right now m8
To everyone that complaining out the micro transactions that are on there way GET THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  OVER IT Welcome to a stone age where games are like this Go and play csgo oh wait same thing You dont need to spend money Its there as an option Not a necessary
Gameplay wise battlegrounds is an amazing gamehowever the devs have recently went back on what they told the community in the early development stages of the gameThey stated that the in game cratescosmetics will be free and can be earned with the ingame curreny that you aquire from playing the gameThis past week bluehole did a complete 180 and announced that the new cosmetics can be obtained by a new type of crate they are intruducing that can be purchased for 250 eachThis shows that the devs have little respect for the the community and are cashing outon top of all this their PR is a nightmare and this terrible gambleing style cash grab needs to come to a stopIf you want this game to head in the right direction vote with your wallet and do not purchase the game and if you doPlease do not contribute to the problemdo not buy any of these crates
Started being little jews and added microtransactions Still going to play the game just don t support the practice
Too many cheaters O sorry Modders
I ll say it I m addicted Thanks a lot friends  you know who you are
MUH SLIPPERY SLOPE DEVS AREN T GONNA FINISH THE GAME MUH REDDIT HNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG Sharts pants 
I found this game fun to play   it s fast paced  there s shenanigans  and it s a different type of shooter for a change It gets somewhat old after time   and I hope for the future the devs release new maps modes and other content to keep it fresh
Game had potential but microtransations will be game breaking
I win all the time so now I have a lot of chickens thanks
if you want to get lag spikes everygame you play then this is the game for you
lol people complaing about micro transactions as if leaving a negative review and suggesting other people to leave negative reviews with you is going to convince them Solid game overall definitely get it when you can you wont regret a single moment playing this
game is great amazing acutally but once again devs only care about is the  and thus micro transaction came to play really devs  FCKING REALLY H1Z1 has done this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off with that sht how about you finish the game first you can tell why I gave this game a thumbs down
PAYERUNRESTRICTED s Battleground for my Walletwhich loot crate does the Optimization patch come in
I can t reccomend a game from a studio that went to town with the sale then decided to do a 180 with their decisions and jam the CSGO microtransaction model in an indie game that ALSO isn t a F2P title
The developers are dumb and gonna ship this game  Titanic  style
GTFO of here with the RNG loot crates  This is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t  I wish I had never bought this game now  PLAYERUNKNOWN is no better than EA at this point
The game is funHard core 3rd person or FPS takes good PC 
They are adding microtransactions Because greed
Additing buggy angering all and all great game
good game  
Best game on Steam worth it
I honestly couldn t care less about the crate system Lots of game have it What I absolutely detest is lying to your customers This is an Early Access game We bought a product based on what was promised and when the devs blatantly lie to their customers and switch out the product we were promised with another right in front of our faces it makes me hate the company It sets a bad precedent and makes them believe that they can keep getting away with lying Don t buy this game if you still havn t until the devs and ESPECIALLY PU get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together Stop screwing your customers with pity stories about glass paned doors and blatant lies And holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PU get a PR manage and stfu You are shooting yourself in the foot everytime you open your god damn mouth
i am changing my review from bad  was only bad because they put crates in but the crates are optional cosmetic only so who cares really great game i am very bad and still always want to come back for more
Great gameA bit laggy but hopefully will get better in 10
It s a fun and entertaining gameHiding clothing purely behind a paywall is greedy  I ll change my review if they change their intentions to something less greedy like the ability to buy the ingame currency but you still earn it playing matchesLootboxes are so hot right now
Perfect one more game i can say has been worth the experience not very many of those happening lately
Finally optimized Pretty goodLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off
LOVE LOVE LOVE  dis gamw
I thought this was a sandwich making simulator when I purchased this product After installing and launching the game client I was very surprised this simulator did not contain bacon or mayo HOW THE HELL CAN I MAKE A BLT WITHOUT BACON OR MAYO
If you like slow paced games filled with noobs and getting shot without knowing where the shots came from and totally broken game mechanics then this game is for you Crap game filled with campers
MT before the release  SHAME ON YOU PU
Microtransactions in a payed early access game is where i draw the line Dusgusting
The gameplay is decent and the game if you can last the initial few minutes is fun If you want a survival arena game this is a good game to geti have had a few software issues that put a damper on the game because the buildings dont render correctly which makes it so i can t operate doors while other players still can
Cosmetics too expensive
Game is really fun playing it solo even better with friends
Makes alot of fun and gives heavy thrillsIn those few moments it s not lagging crashing or losing connectionNOT RECOMMENDET for users without high end PC
I been playing this game for about 300 hours so far and all I can say is that is very addictivePeople have been complaining about micro transactions but really Just don t use that feature and enjoy the game because after all that little crate with crapy costumes is not going to make you a better player not that I am but just sayingThere are a few things I love and completely dislike about this gameLOVE  its very addictive and overall huge improvements from when it was releasedDISLIKE  Team freaking KILLS   stop that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  there are so many trolls when doing auto matching it s sad and not having the option to report them its even worse I feel there should be a limit set to like 10 team kills per week or month and then you can t do auto matching  STAY POSITIVE AND PLAY CLEAN
Top game
Paid crate keys negate any good this game has and shows what the developers thing of the promises they make to us Rating this a no go for money grabing developers
Would be a great game if these dev s listened to the people But instead they just focus on everything we dont need like Emotes and weapon skins
Really cool gameI d say very few bugs considering it s Early AccessLots of content added and more to comeThe game fun and all the games are very different and always something funny happensThe adrenaline this game provides is pretty unique go for it it s really worth the price 
Don t let greed kill this game
Game is good but you never know when a patch comes and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE es you overpreviosly this would happen and fix my game but not anymoreThe only thing that fixes the game for me isBattlEye Launcher when it comes with this message 18 15 30  Starting BattlEye Service18 15 33  Launching game18 18 05  Note  File blocks can be ignored if they don t cause problems with the game18 18 05   INFO  Blocked loading of file   C  Windows System32 tprb 5154 nsibdll and this is random when it starts for me but i usally can just launche a game then try to play untill this guys launches then the game runs as its best for me

Lovely game even though it is in its beta phase Very addictive And the team options are also greatsometimes it crashes tho but overall it is an awesome gameMust try
Seriously no Kill Cam  wtf 
Released on my birthday and is a amazing game even though im early access definetly recomended by me
I m lovin it
Useless devs who are trying to sue people for doing Battle Royale better Sold their souls for lootboxes supported cheaters to boost their skin onomy and the game is still a messWell done on nuking a great idea Brendan Greene you cockend
Awesome game Best game I have played since CS 16 The rush you get from the final 20 is awesome 330 hours in and still loving it Sure it can be frustating and there are still bugs but they are working to fix it  
Very gud game i need more maps savage
Its the PUBG of the dark souls of PUBG games
If you like this kind of game better play Last Man Standing FOR FREE PUBG actually steals 30 from your money for not even giving you the simplest options The game has no field of view no VSync no FPS counter no quickslots for items and many more things that are standard for almost every game The game is lacking the most simple options like allowing the player to choose if he want to toggle or hold aiming and crouching All of this are options provided by Last Man Standing as F2P Game On top of that it s a lot easier to obtain skins and cosmetic items in a F2P game than in PUBGPUBG actually costs money and provides you just a buggy game full of cluttered inventory frame drops and lack of options that should be standard for every shooter game in the universe no matter how lazy the developers actually are The only thing I liked about PUBG is that the map is actually really big and provides a lot variety which increases the fun for the playerUPDATE  At this point they added a FOV slider but also introduced microtransactions which make this review even more negative than it used to be
Not a bad game slightly better than h1z1 not my favorite game but isn t bad
great game but really needs optimized both in UI and in game I get dissapointed when i get a box and it dosent open then the UI crashes and you lose a peace of gear that you thought you had very stupid in game you know what you need to do you just need to do it
Freaking awesome
Amazing Game xdd
Best game ive played since halo 3
  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING    M I C R O T R A N S A C T I O N S  UPDATE  From negative to positiveLet me be absolutely clear   I still have an awful taste in my mouth from the scummy microtransations that Bluehole has implemented into PUBG It still saddens me to see a product that I ve been supporting from practically the beginning decide to take that pathHowever I d be lying if I said that PUBG isn t a fun game I ve certainly gotten my money s worth out of it Make sure you play this with friends If you restrict yourself to solos this game is gonna get old for you fast
This game is a lovehate relationship at its finest I get mad every game but I still always come back for moreNever had any issues on my end Better than H1Z1 You know you want this game GET THIS GAME
They released an uncompleted game full of bugs and unoptimizations Don t bother
Hackers started to fk up the game 
This game is like H1Z1 without zombies But this game has better graphics and better game mechanics
get it
excellent game full of intense and adrenaline rushing situations deserves a thumbs up
i have a few words for thisthis is by far the best game ever produced by human handsthis is without saying the community the community is trash so if your looking to get a game to be buddy buddy with a crap ton of people this is not the game for you if however you are a self centered scoundrel wanting to blow off steam and ruin it for everone else welcome to the community that in every way shape and form embodies a person such as yourselfall in all a very nice game indeed
Its Marvalos
Honestly this is my favorite game I have played in a very long time It is seperate from every other ordinary game out there right now and always keeps you invested in the game no pay to win just play to have funI would recommend this to anyone
This game is great for lots of people
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS hot topic on game forums live streams and social mediaFirst things first  for the people unfamilair with this game PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS  PUBG for short is a Battle Royale game  And with that i don t mean Clash Royale every player you meet is a threat for you andor your team every decision you make can be the diffrence between life and death and there can only be one player or team to get that infamous  chicken dinner  that we all want so badlyAs already known by most people this game is still an  Early Acess  game Where most games stay in that state there is hope for PUBG The developers launch weekly and monthly updates and a full release date is set to be around end 4Q 2017 with new content and the  Where i m personally the most hyped for a vaulting system it has been a pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE  to get over walls and fencesWhen it comes to gameplay PUBG runs smoothly on my current system with everything on high and shadows on medium but even the most beefiest pc will have some framedrops as the game isn t fully optimized yet The shooting feels rather nice the attachment system is a blast and the car physics are just hilarious as most players will crash their car andor turn it upside down frustrating at times hilarious at some points but overall they are ok The beginning of a match where you fly over the island by plane is a nice touch as you can choose where you want to land the big city with lots of loot but also lots of people or that small village with less risk less reward  the choice is yours I also like the reward system where each game gives you BP  Battle points you can buy crates that contain lots of cosmetica that gives you a small capacity boost one piece more then the other Crates get more expensive with each purchase but luckily the prices get resetted each mondayThe only downsides i have is that only Twitch Prime members can make custom lobbies  everyone can join and i personally don t like the Third Person aspect of the game luckily there will be First Person lobbies soon so i will gladly wait for those you can already find some custom First Person lobbies only  if they aren t full or private And please for the love of god  TURN YOUR VOICE CHAT TO TEAM ONLY Unless you like getting LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in the ear while everyone is waiting for the game to start i recommand you don t put your voice chat on  all Overall PUBG does everything better then it s rival H1Z1 KOTK even dou some people stay loyal with H1Z1 so will i do the same with PUBG the feeling of adrealine rushing through you as the thoughts of getting shot from every angle makes it only better This game is best enjoyed with friends but it s still a good timewaster when playing alone EDIT it seems most people complain about the servers being LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  In response to that i have a few things to say  Are you sure you are playing on the correct server  I know there is a recent bug that changes your region to the asia server Is it maybe your internet router or Ethernet portWLAN card that is causing any lag  Do realise that Bluehole is only an indie developer with their game having atleast more then 1 million players everyday with even a peak of 2 million sometimes for an indie company i think they do a good job and that they always try their best to fix there serversI also heard that the people in Asia apperently gets add in game not that this effects the rest of the world but i do hope that everything gets fixed so that our friends in Asia can also enjoy this gDDRThese are my current specs when writing this review  Gigabyte GTX 1050 TI 4GB DDR5 Intel Core i5 7400 300 GHz 16 GB DDR4 RAM
The game is literally buggier than h1z1 For around the first 30 seconds the match starts the textures dont loadThe cars are probs the most buggiest thing i have ever seen in a game basically impossible to drive them and you get the most LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t deaths everParachuting is terrible aswell literally times i lose half my health because it glitchesSolo is also boring as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE You can legit go 5 10 miutes without finding a single arPros  Fun with friends
its a drug
Absolute AIDS
Welp i ve been playing this game for a while now and I have to say that it is one of the funnest games I have every played  It is a great survival game What I love is that to win you have to be strategic If you aren t you wont win I have my sound turned way up just so I can hear footsteps I would definitly recomend this game 1010 would pan someone in the face again
You ll come across way more treehuggers in this game than in real life 1010
stick to making mods nibba
This game is worth 30 dollars buy
So I am going  to tell you improvements and my feelings since times when game has been releasedI bought this game 3 4 months after this game came out I played so much on zero versions Since then developers have made VERY SURPRISING WORK ON THIS 2017 s GEM Yes Happy new year 2018 guys XD Now when 10 came out game s performance has surprisingly IMPROVED FPS are more stable and playability is much better Keep up developers you made excellent work already Really worth those money
det saarn set fe nok
This game  is amazing 1010
Addicting AF Great blend of tactics and action Q ing solo gets old but if you have a bunch of friends who can duo or squad with you the game is fantastic Alot of fun Alot of laughs And some chicken dinner on top
EPIC FUN WITH HOMIES
this game like a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    never play it 
Best battle royal and survivor game i ve ever played
fast fun and intense
At current stage the game is barely playable Pretty much if you want to have a bearablegood gaming experience you ll have to optimise the game yourself follow tutorials on youtube and changing settings on your PC Not worth it
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME SERVER LAG LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME 
Very bad Optimized Game
Of course this is a great game if you have the computer to survive the low FPS and random lagUnfortunately my potato can t handle this game So once optimizing the game is done it could be good
Love the game Keep up the hard work fixing bugs and server issues
I don t understand the hype around this game I can forgive bugs and poor optimisation because it s an early access game but it s far too expensive for what you actually get
This is the most frustrating rage inducing awesome and wonderful gameImagine 10 games like this 3x you ll be killed pretty much instantly by someone who found a weapon before you did3x you ll get killed by a camper in a shed after you just spent 20min looting2x you ll make it to the Top 10 where you then proceed to make a stupid mistake and die1x you ll crash due to an out of memory exception1x you ll win
Inital impression is good Gameplay is smooth enough for an early access game Being a fan of H1Z1 this game has a lot more flow to it makes it easier to get around and shows the right amount of difficulty for the the player to enjoy Great game to play with your friends not so great for your heart rate by yourself 1010
amazing game get it
Game might be poorly optimzied but hey atleast their  UPDATES aren t unlike daybreak giving us more skins and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  overall I could recommend this games asking price but hey if you can wait for a sale
The game is very fun but it appears that you have no anti cheat or one that s worth a crap I would recomend cause it is fun but you all need to fix this one thing
The game is fun But here is the catchThe servers are complete garbage I can only assume they left them as is and try to  optimize  to the servers However it seems to be darts and a dartboard for these devs I do not care if the game is  alpha   beta  whatever Those tags mean very little in todays gaming market Every game seems to be early access or in one of those phases Ultimately this studio uses thes tags as a license to be second rate devs and it showsThe game needs serious help with latency and server issues Simply put its bad The user base knows it and they know it They simply dont care at this time because the plebs just play to play The only credit I give them is not making a bunch of skins while having all these issues Other than that they need to get their sht together and fix the most basic part of any competitive gameAt this time just save your money and wait for either a sale or for them to fix basic issues that they know make the game complete garbage to any competitive gamer
Playing solo Alright i m in the top 15 I can do this Enters building to get killed by a camper in a bathroom  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Boring game
This is one of the best games i ve ever played I highly recomend this game to people who are searching for a multiplayer game because you will play it for hours
my only complaint is sometimes the buildings won t render in leading to my absolute annihilation
I heard a certain country was number 1 like 30 times and was called racial slurs by at least twenty people was set on fire and shot in the middle of the street and nearly downed All within the first minute Jump out of airplane grab a shotgun run through some brush get run over racial slurs ensue Get back in get better weapons make it to 41210I d play all night again
Most realistic battle royale game
Servers are too busy please try again later THANK YOU PUBG ALWAYS BUSY GAME IS ALWAYS LAGGING
laji
                                    PLEASE 
Best battle royale gameneed optimization real bad
Very tense and involving Needs optimizing but overall runs decently
Can t play Need refund Servers are too busy
First match landed right next to someone and proceeded to run like hell to the first builiding we see with him hot on my tracks Ran in and slammed the door shut What did I find  A crowbar right at my feet My killer bashes in the door runs full speed right at me thinking I m still unarmed Boom Headshot with a crowbar 1010 will parachute to my death againand againand again
Just Yes
Jump off a plane where kids are yelling non sense land near 5 other squad run to get a gun and end up face to face with a guy with an AKM and dieTotally would play again1010
more addictive than crackearly access since developers are still working on improvements and community suggestionsthe way early access is supposed to work and not to sell a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  not working alpha build that will be left as soon as the first money is in  aka dayZ
DONT BE A IDIOT AND YOU WILL WIN LmaoJust use IRL strats and stay behind cover is all i can really say I have a I5 4690k oc d to 47ghz with a corsairH80i wc Gigabyte GTX1060 6GB and i play this game on ultra 68 100 fps just fine
Very fun game to both watch and play look forward to upcoming updates
Good stuff
Bans people for defending themselves against a team killer they were match made with Guess i have to clarify I m talking about Sxk7 who was banned for killing a random team mate he was matchmade with that was killing his friends first
It s like crack
Yeah It s pretty good

Fun with friends
Slick af bought it by mistake worth it i guessAfter 1 month i think it was pretty worth it lol
Gunplay mechanics are decent however graphically it s been down graded heavily on the other hand performance is better It looks like a game that came out in 2012 to be honest it reminds me of that era which is not good for a open world game that came out in 2017 Net code is still awful that again is not good for battle royal open world games in general There are tons of issues with server connectivity this issue has been around since it was in early access I highly doubt that these problems would get resolved soon but here they areIt s clucky AF even though it s been  released Do you hate having to deal with hard campers in every little hole in a freaking open word game  this game is filled with them and that s the only way you can get to top 10 out of 100
I guess its fun
Awesome game  adventure perfect Hope new map will be better then this one  d
Devs would rather make a mobile game and make loot boxes rather than fix their actual game
Awesome game too bad it has a problem with cheaters Its nearing unplayable because of the cheatingEdit couple of months since I wrote review cheating and lag has sadly increasedEdit2 as of 10 Rubberbanding is off the charts and the cheating is still there  Edit3 as of yesterdays patch  2018 01 11 the game crashed at random timesEdit 4 as of 2018 02 23 cheaters are still everywhere  Edit 5 as of 2018 04 24 nothing has really changed I love the gamemode can some other dev please make better version of this game 
Game is attractive and interesting to play RECOMMEND
Finally decided to pull the trigger and buy this game GREAT decision This game is so addicting It needs a lot of work yet and it s very obviously an alphaearly release but as they polish it more and with the strong fanbase and player core this game has this game will definitely be a AAA title worthy of top 5 status Can t wait to see this game grow and become more optimized and smooth If you can get over the graphics and lag this game is an absolute blast 910
Dosent suck
Game is dope Can t wait for the final version to come out
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  community managers a game where you can get baned if your team mates atack you The community manager was even brave enough to say if you dont wana get griefed dont play
Third degree paranoia simulator
Things have been better im got a better frame rate and with the new anti cheat i hope more cheaters get banned as  it greatly discourages players to play speaking from my own experience
Extremely clever realistic and adrenaline inducing
very good play together add me thanks
fun game but very poorly optimized each consecutive game loads slower and slower untill the point where i lad and the map is not done loading which means i cannot enter hosues and i just die before i can do anything will check it out later when performance updates hit
So i ve played about 18 hours of this game and its great Porbably better with a group The friends I play with aren t the most tactical XD but its fun and it definitly gets the adrenaline going
So i have played alot of pubg as you can see but THIS IS A FUN GAME NOT A GOOD GAME
Easy to pick up fun to play but be carefull of teamkillers  NealioBro13 for example
The inconsistent trash gameplay is almost as annoying as the Twitch fanbase that streams it
Fantastic game addictive completely recommend
Chinese hackers and people with aimbot basically sums this up  We re dealing with hackers  Devs I call LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t
This game is so fun I don t see why it is not released as a full version yet For this type of game I thing this one is the best
In love with this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game
Great game Besides the free version  buggy af with serious lag problems which name i wont specify this game is uniquemany servers to pick from so location   lag isnt an issue what so ever you can pretty much pick where you spawn in via air drop and have plenty of time to arm up go into war and then head to zone before barrier comes overhighly recommendedlets hope they dont bump the price up when full release comes out like ARK devs did that will kill itpsplease add 2 pack purchase option for a little savings so my cheap LOVE LOVE LOVE  mates get on it As AUD conversion is a killerGame could use optimization tweaks i run sli and still get lock ups on camera rotations
How can this not be called the hunger games video games   This is a great early access game The full release is gonna be great and i cant wait to hop on and enjoy more of this gameCons  Weird partial gamepad support Full gamepad support will be much appreciated not everyone plays mouse   keyboard Initial character customization needs more depth Skin color hair etc etc
Just buy it  it is that good
I still hate it and love it at the same time
If you played arma 2 dayz mod and been looking for a game to fill that gap since the standalone was so f    ing terrible look no further  Playing this game 4 man is the most fun ive had in years when it comes to pc gaming  Going solo is also an intense edge of your seat high reward experience too  Love this game 5 worth the 2699
I have not played that much but this game is godamn godly
Worst LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimised game ever made Full of bugs and desync s and completly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hitboxes Devs got millions put up there LOVE LOVE LOVE  and did nothing with it except jerk off
Pure Cancer experience
If you are a tactics person steady  and patient enough to watch your opponents moves capable of team work and  if you like realistic weapon combat this game is for you  If not stay away
very LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  absolutely garbage i would rather play csgo and that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game is dead
after playing this game for a fair amount of time now i can now type a fair review for the game1the game has to many lag and de sync issues2 the game is riddled with hackers3there is only 1 mode and it gets boring fast4the current 1 and only map is far to open5 to many bugs like doors not working   items spawning inside terrain so you cant get them6 lacking in content like more variety of weapons and vehicles7 tackysticky  combat8hit detection is poor9 vehicle physics are poor10 lacking of enough weaponitem spawns to actualy stand a chance against other playersnot being funny but this game needs allot of work and its not worth the 2699 price tag it hasthe game is a complete and utter mess right now like for starters all the hackers and other problems the game is just unplayable
Now im ready for my review hackers nr one to many number 2 Ping and server lag will kill you love the game but players don t kill me the server is killing me let them fix this and i would 100  recomend thisThis is why the server is killing me while im behind the wall im quick tapping my Q or E to look around the corner when i come back boom dead  What is that called server ping 200ms is more than enough to get a girl pregnant Pull out while you can don t take a chance
I really do enjoy this game ever sence I got the game I ve been playing it none stop but the cheatershackers are my main issue Nothing is more frustrating when you re in the top 10 and getting killed by a hacker then watch the feed and see him kill everyone in a matter of seconds
Finger lickin good
I once led an army of approximately 83 players in a single file line as we crawled towards the raging waves that ran rampant off the nearby coast The match started before we made it there
Can be extrremely frustrating but also extremely fun
Buy this game todie
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing awesome gameplaycontent even tho graphics is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Vote yes for south africa servers
Amazing game graphics are stunning if your computer can run the good resolution I have over 200 plus hours on this game Way different then any other battle royale games which a lot of them have one map where this game is going to release 2 new maps Never gets boring
love it gets the heart pumping
best game everrrr  
made my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hard
I wish I never played it but I did win my first ever game so I guess the only thing that came from playing this was a feeling of accomplishment then loads and loads of disappointment
                        
SERVER SAMPAH ASU
57 would place 95th again
I haven t been able to get it to connect to a game since buying it All other games work fine allowed through firewall etc etc Refunding
I ve had to change my review since I last posted it in August This game has gone downhill since then but still remains enjoyable Hackers are somewhat rampant absolutely aggravating bugs still exist and there are numerous issues with the game in general but I still keep coming back Why  Because this is hands down the best experience you can have with friends I never find myself playing solos in this game but the tactical decisions you can make with a few buddies in discord is astonishing Out of my 226 hours I ve currently played maybe 10 of those have been spent on solo games and that was just me dicking around Solos yield about as much joy as putting a toothpick under your big toenail and kicking a concrete wall but Duos and Squads on the other hand are pure fun to playOne genuine flaw between all game types though is the bugs and server glitches The better half of the time I don t find myself blaming me for my death and it feels like the server or game cheated me out of surviving Sometimes the hit detection can be ridiculous and the movement can feel like a clunky mess but here s hoping it gets fixed by the end of this yearOverall I do recommend this game for the sole reason that I ve managed to get over 200 hours of enjoyment out of it I feel like once the actual release hits on December 12th many things will be fixed and it will be a much more enjoyable experience
Just like your typical Early access games this game still has the following   Laggy Servers Faulty Hit Registration CheatersAll they managed to do is make the game run smoothly by 20 frames within months of development despite making Millions
Most intense game ever for these reasons there is always a twist just when you think you can smell that chicken dinnerA  A wild Network lag appearsB  your game Freezes  crashesC  decides to kick you out of the gameOther instances like not ever knowing where gun shots are being fired and spending 10 minutes trying to jump over a wall to ultimately give up and go aroundlets not forget parkour which is impossible to do with all the fps dropsgame has potential but needs alot of workAfter a lot of updates game is still a piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but i still play iti rate it 510 keyboards broken
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game01 would not bang
Just bought the game I am within the minimun requirements by a lot and I cant even get the the main menu it is stuck on the loading screen

THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME I CAN T BELIEVE HOW MUCH FUN IT IS AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND I DON T HAVE MANY HOURS XD
PUBG was game that had a lot of potential it was thrown away by childish developpers who wasted time trying to milk every penny from the players with microtransactions They would also waste their time and money by suing other companies instead of focusing on themselves and looking to improve their own game The optimization is still pretty bad hackers are everywhere connection problems and in my opinion the games last to long and some of the controls are really clunky especially with the vehicles The 40 pricetag is also LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t given the actual quality of this game compared to Fortnite which is free

REGION LOCK CHINA REGION LOCK CHINA Game has become unplayable Have played the last few days for the first time in a couple of months and I m struggling to find reasons to ever play the game again Cheating to the Chinese is just normal it s part of the game to them   kind of like how all their athletes take drugs at the Olympics and don t see anything wrong with it they just think it s normal to them   and they have ruined this once increadily fun game completely A game that had the potential to be the best game I ve ever played But now go into any region s server outside of the Asian servers and over 50  of the players are Chinese They flood the voice chat they abuse people they openly admit to cheating and laugh about it The developers are more worried about putting in emote systems new maps guns skins etc rather than fixing their broken game I played 6 games tonight and 5 of them I was killed by either A  Players who knew exactly where I was on the map in the replay they beelined towards me knew exactly what building and floor I was on and when I heard them coming and hid waiting they turned and shot me in a heartbeat   knowing exactly what corner of the room I was in They were also able to see where I was from far away as many times I have been in a building and heard bullets hit the other side of the wall I was standing on No gunshot just the bullet hitting the wall That means they were incredibly far away shooting shots at me as they could see my gamertag but couldn t see that I was behind a wall and out of line of sight because of their distance from me A clear indication of cheating before they usually drive up to you and kill you at close rangeB  Auto Aiming players Watching death cam I saw their aim snap to me Their crosshairs were clearly to the right or left of me and when they aimed down their scope it snapped onto my playerC  No recoil players  usually came with auto aim Exactly as stated no recoil on their gun which allowed them to shoot guns in full auto without any spray   every bullet as accurate as their firstD  Teamers   Chinese love to team Killed a number of times by groups of 4 6 and 8 in duo servers who would then all come and loot my corpse together without killing each other clearly showing they were working on the same teamIn addition to those main cheats I ve also seen occasionally people driving boats on land and through the air speed hackers  players running at the speed of a car or faster and even a guy who had somehow managed to use a pan as a helmet  making it impossible to shoot him in the head as the pan is bullet proof to anyone who doesn t already play this gameIf I could refund the money I would If you haven t bought this game yet save your money unless you re a cheating Chinese player I used to regularily make top 10 and won multiple games in solo duo and squad I was a good player Not the best but good v10 released and now I can t even compete because of the cheaters As someone who has played online games for over 20 years I have never seen a game with so many cheaters that never gets fixed
i love  that game
Great game One of the best Battle royales i ve every played I highly recommend for all steam players
Greedy greedy developers Its a fun game with friends dont get me wrong but its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ridiculous that Bluehole manages to squeeze micro transaction updates into almost every single update Now I see they straight up sell content for real money as well
G
Sorely Dissapointant ith the recent updateBetween Unbalence weapons OP SMGs Server downtime in the middle of peak for NA and constant Frame Drops makes this game a Hot LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Mess Horrible
I doesnt care about myengland but this game is not solid
Yep nothing like that chicken dinner feeling
Game is ruined now with new patches all become lagging and a lot of bugs and other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  In begining game was so much better ruined like h1z1  dont buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Player Unknown Hacking GroundsI havent dedicated alot of hours on this game like most gamers but i can assure you getting quicked scoped behind a mountain and watching a death cam of guided aim that looks nothing like flick shots are cheating Tactics and cover wont save you cause some hacker will spot you 1000 meters a away before he even scopes in on you  This game is fantastic and until the cheating gets resolved i am only playing on xbox where its a even playing feild
I bought it about 2 days ago and haven t played anything else since xD 42010
All I will say is if you want a battle royale this is by far the best one I have played 100s of hours in H1Z1 but the mechanics in this are so much better and would recommend this to everyone
doof
parachute loot get guns hide die Kill someone eventually Repeat
can we not force people to p lay inside to zone the 8x8 island is there for a reason 95 people dead in 2 minutes what is the point we want a game like this so we can actually go out n find people take our time to find them not die from being outside the zone
Way to addicting Cant stop playing Help me
Spent 45  minutes looking for a single player When I found one and the firefight begain the game ran at something like 1 fps I have a very very good machine that can run almost anything perfectly That should be enjoyed with AT LEAST 30 fps  If you re running on servers for your region  you should be able to do it lag free without the constant  network connection errors that everyone constantly had I don t think I ll be able to play this fame the way it was meant to which is a shame because I was really looking foward to it
Highly recommend great laugh with friends and family
Fun game to play with friends  
wtf still have many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bugs
bestest game ever
late game is extremely boring cause youl get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed over by rng and sniped from someone who got better gear early game fights are more fun cant say the game is bad but its getting a bit stale with no new content
its okay I guess just really buggy  
Probably the funnest game i ve played in a while Highly recommend
Very good game worth the 30 dollars Great physics very hard with great balance You want friends though to play with
i would just recommed having a good computer becuase its a preaty beefy game but other than that its a pretty good game
Original review  July 17 2017 I really enjoy this game Unfortunately there is a lot that still needs fixed The pre game player lobby is ridiculously obnoxious with the gun fire The textures make the hair look terrible and the screaming from everyone is even more ridiculous I know you can mute people but that doesn t make it any less obnoxious One thing I don t enjoy about this that I do like on KotK is that the parachute automatically opens and then it seems to take forever to get to the ground The airplane noises are deafeningly loud and I m getting really tired of blasting people in the face with a shotgun to have nothing happen to them but then I die with a pistol or something just as stupid Also when you jump out of cars you should just get damaged even going slowly if I jump out I somehow manage to die which is totally unrealistic There needs to be more loot in the bathroomsbedrooms of the houses I can t really think of anything else right now though but I enjoy this game Can t wait until more fixes have been made    Update  August 20 2017Still a lot broken in this game But they added horns so who cares sarcasm So aside from the glitchy menu and constantly having to refresh to UI I m glad they added in the ability to rejoin a game That is very needed The matchmaking is pretty instant which is great It s a great game to play with friends Though since the last update my game has been crashing and it has never done that previously The BP takes forever to get and then you get the most LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  loot I ve ever had in a game like ever Two red hats and dirty tank tops later I m annoyed this game is fun don t get me wrong Just fix it I punched a dude no exaggeration about 15 20 times and he didn t even get knocked out He had enough time to load up a pistol and shoot me once and I m down That parts a little more realistic but the fact that I punched him so much and nothing happened sucks The repetitive gas cans everywhere and lack of decent weapons is slightly annoying SK12 shoots WAY too far as compared to the other shotguns which seem to do absolutely no damage sometimes unless the barrel of the shotgun is in their esophagus pistols don t do enough damage Not enough decent gun attatchments  ie I hardly ever find silencers for the gun I am using unless I go into the middle of a city where I ultimately end up dying because everyone else is there too The plane sound at the beginning is ridiculously loud as well as the dropping wind after jumping out and we should be able to turn that down if we want to since it s not something that will change the gameplay There should also be a way to turn down public voice chat as I would love to listen to the random crap everyone is saying I just don t want to hear it screamed in my ears It would still be nice to drop lower before the parachute opens up because it just takes soooo long to reach the ground The damage from jumping out of cars is also ridiculously insane as even if you slow down you still end up getting knocked our andor dying Still no loot in certain rooms of houses and buildings Updates are coming to fix things and they are listening but voting down because there is so much to be fixed early access or not
so far 20 hrs in and i can tell you in the most positive way that pubg is the game for you sure theres some problems to be fixed But afterall  it is still an early access game The devs will impliment a new map following with a new Zombies Mode and a sprinkle of extra animations Ex  jumping off the windows like Leon in RE4I CANT WAIT FOR THE UPDATE  Dps buy the game
Its a very good game I like that it is very realistic and you need to have alot of inteligence
banned for no reason
just buy it
The most promising game to date  It only took one game of playing to get hooked and this is a beta still  I picked it up two weeks ago and have almost forty hours  The concept graphics and gameplay is awesome I can t wait to see where the developers take the game

10 out of 10 absolutely love this game the only thing it could use is more guns and sights
Sorry but i don t understand all the hype about this game and yes i know the game is in an early stage and it will get better optimize   later on   if you re into camping and not doing nothing or running for a long time after you got your loot just to get randomly killed from who knows where then this is your game    The island is too big and it feels like there s only 10 cars in the game it s dumb to die outside the blue ring because the next zone is all the way accross the island with that size of a map and the game mechanics of keeping you on the move it doesn t make sense the low amount of transportation   This game doesn t even feel close to being competitive at all yes you land unarmed like the rest of the players but it s all about luck whom ever gets a good gun first wins btw if the sole purpose of the game is to kill eachother why isn t there a larger amount of weaponry all over the place   Personally i don t recomend this game but neither i dislike it maybe i ll just wait a year or two to see this game runing as intended Save yourself the money and buy some other game
Hands down the best game I ve played all yearThere are bugs The game crashes My computer doesn t handle the memory leak very well nor does it really hold up to the demands of the game But it s playable It s fun It s amazing30 is a bargain I bought this game last week and have already played over 30 hours When I measure entertainment value I compare it to a trip to the theater which often costs 5 to 10 per hour sometimes more if you go for snacks At that comparison this is the most financially responsible 30 I ve spent in a long timeIt s still early access and the game continues to improve With new modes and new maps coming soon I think it s irresponsible not to buy this game immediately if you are even somewhat interested Get a microphone get 3 friends and go hog wildI ll be plunking the bats for the foreseeable future

Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is a Standalone battle royale game which runs on the unreal engine it is a skill packed multiplayer video game in early access it has quite a few glitches in it but is still very enjoyable you will be put in a 100 player arena to fight to the death i highly reccomend u getting the game
By far one of the best games on Steam Drop on an island with 99 other people and fight until your the last man standingPros Active DevsRealistic weapons and bullet dropGreat sound for hearing opponents and flankingNew weapons being added and mapsvaulting promisedCons Finding weapons can be RNG sometimesDesync issues do occur these can be annoying
yup
Love this game but some cheaters and bugs make it irritating
with 300h on my record i can say this game is starting to fall off behind infested with cheaters and laggy servers make the environment for playing this game unpleasant each update brings more bugs than the previous one having so the dev should take a second look into this game for more optimizations and bug fixes and leave the cosmetics and new maps for later or we all are going to be parachuting from another plane soon  fortnite s busthis is the next H1Z1 for sure IT HAS THE D SYNC THING where ur shots doesnt count save your money for MAVREKS a better more optimized game with improved NET code pubg has to be the worst game ever
Good so far just please dont turn into The Culling Please
bloody amazing
Nothing new at all movement in the game is like running in tar graphics are 1024x768 at best unless you use some kind of app like reshader Honestly just a cheaper knock off of H1Z1 I think its a little more than coincdence that this game has the exact same default key assigments as H1Z1 Basiclly H1Z1 with 10x worse graphics and net play was bad too And no I dont need to play it 120 hrs before posting my opinion playing just an hour or so was enough
Can t reccomend this game enough THE best battle royale out there
It s the only game I know where running with a pan literally saves your a  1010
A type of game that i love i think is way better than h1z1 The new upcoming things they will put will be dope af i recommend this game 100 
Fantastic fun Can t wait to see what more they do with it
It sapped many an hour out of my life in the first week i had the game time well spent im clinically obese now
Awesome addictive and thrilling If its this good in early access I cant even imagine how much fun I ll be having with the finished product
I can t stop playing it
Fresh start every game so many strategies game is great
1010 love to loot for almost 15min to walk in to someone s house whilst he is hiding in a corner with a shotgun
chicken dinner 
Cheap game don t buy it if you want an optimized experience you will face endless bugs and cheaters is slow paced game not fun at all  you will be playing a game of 20 min looting as much as you can to be killed in the end by a glitch cuz of the bike or car clipping in the environmentloot isn t balanced at all scopes and some weapons are overpowered without any counter for them   or chance to counter these weaponsit s a sniper simulation and it s done poorly
Sneaking around a firefight is scarier than most horror games 910
Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is smouldering my once extinguised faith in early access games
Very good and interesting game I like it
One of the best EA games It s fun  even more with friends it s competitive realistic  almost like a simulator of surviving in Russia and for an EA game it has a lot of content so far But on the other hand it is poorly optimized buggy hit boxes are eeeeehh good    few hackers spectate mode sucks but that s all going to be fixed hopefully The devs seem like great people that care for the game and update the game every week and month And the updates are always full of amazing and interesting content It s what you would expect from a BATTLE ROYALE gameIt s definitely worth the full price
Starts a game sits in a house full of loot waiting for someone to walk into my shotgun barrel no one comes in the moment i walk outside i get killed by someone walking past the house  3 gg
This game is full of hackers Its not if you will be hacked its when and your account will be banned I have never been banned on any games for cheating or anything I play fair and dont use bots I am banned from this game for having my steam hacked and a hacker going ham on my account I guess I haven t heard from steam or the Devs on why I was banned I m just guessing Steam just said  game ban  when I asked no explaination Devs have yet to write me back on why they  game banned  me I don t recommend this game for anyoneits probably not going to make it to a full game there is  just to many hackers and the devs and steam are not doing anything but banning innocent players To be honest I think most players banned are being banned to make them rebuy the game I am not going to rebuy this game it s a hacker peice of crapSide note its not the gameplay they made that betterit s the ammount of hackers in this game I see it as 7 out of 10 battles there is a hacker in game How to spot them is easyIf the circle is huge and the player count is around 20 or 30 there is a hacker that cleared a city with headshots so he can loot otherwise he would die because he sucks The other is they see you no matter how sneaky you think you are and they run right up to you and kill you because they are using the wall hack where you go change files and you dont see walls anymore and can shoot through them There are several other hacks to this game I just shared a few I have seen personally To see other hacks go to youtube and type Battle ground hacks and that will also show you how many hacks there are The way I see it is the Devs are onboard with the hackers and don t mind afterall thats how this game was made right 
het loop de heletijd vast
Completely false advertised I mean look at that photo in the top right nobody is going to be wearing a level 3 helmetIs this what game creation has come to

This game is dope I ve had alot of fun playing it
if you like gearing up and killing people then walking into a house where someone closed all the doors and ends up shotgunning you when you go up the stairs then this is the game for you
Maybe I am just bad at this game  which wouldn t bother me as much but I feel like this game punishes me for playing the highest possible graphics settings That s not enjoyable
peww peww skrrt skrrt
worst ambush simulator everr
Do you like camping  Do you like looting  Do you like lying prone in open fields  Do you like PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i  Then PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is for you

Very fun intriguing and addicting game but I CAN T LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING WIN ANYTHING
Ok here I went on this game just about nowPros Baituful graphics nice chims and vecihlesGood sense of shoting you felt like you hit your enamyVery hit boxesBeerUnpros Not histocompatibleSometimes when you mine see enemy screen stucks less fpsSomethimes I shall not find weapons it is not goodAnd this is the largest ones  WHY THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  NOT YOU WANT TO INDUCE GIMMICK LIKE CAR95   I AM NOT RACIST OR ANYTHING BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO PLAY WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN NIGGERAS 
After 300h on this game and thousands of hours on other battle royale games here s the main thing you need to know about PUBG  I m not going to do a list of positive or negatives but instead i ll say this  There are mainly 2 types of gamers  the casuals and the hardcores  Usually the casuals prefer the arcade  fast paced  not heavily focused on realism types of games  and althought you can still play this game casually and enjoy it by playing squad with friends and messing around  if you are planning on playing only solo or even duos  this game is most likely not for you  This game is very tactical  slow paced and more on the realistic side of things  which usually brings in the hardcore and competitive players in  and that is what you will be facing all day in solos and duos  But if you play games alot and you like to be competitive then this game is 100  for you  it will make you feel an adrenaline rush like no other when you re getting close to that chicken dinner and since it is much harder than most games to win  it will also feel incredibly rewarding Yes there are still some issues that needs to be dealt with  I won t deny that  But you have to understand that there is no such thing as a flawless game  and you also need to know that this game has been made in a little over a year  which is amazing  On top of that  the dev team is listening to the community and constantly updating and bringing new content into the game  So to sum it up   Forget about the haters they don t know what they are talking about  and buy the game if you are either a casual planning to do squads with friends and mess around  or if you are an hardcore gamer who wants to feed your competitive spirit  If you aren t either of these 2 then you should look for another game
My favorite part about the game is when I spent 30 minutes getting the best weapons best armor and 50 different healing items just for some dude with a shotgun to shoot me from behind a wall 010 wall third person incorectly again
Great early access game Does it have bugs  Yes It s fully optimized  NO  it s EA so don t expect that It s a great game solo or with friends The devs are communicating with its playerbase very well There are patches every week on Thrusdays and a large update packed with goodies at the end of every month It s a top seller for a reason
over hyped
Make funny username already taken make lame name customize character and start match Pre game lobby is full of screaming jerks Start game jump from plane land beat a guy to death with my bare freaking hands feel badass engulfed by blue boundry find offroad vehicle GTF outta dodge find shack kill guy looting Pick up 8X scpe for my rifle Spot victim 4 shots fired wait im dead guy pinched me from beind headshot 1 bullet im dead 1010 would fist beatdown again
Good game Hackers bad   
Very similar to golf You have one good game every 20 but that s enough to get you hooked Also like golf much more fun with friendsand while drinking
Best blur simulator  after 1 week  i ve rushed for glasses
i recommend this game if you have good pc or laptopin my case that is not option   i have 960m in my laptop and i cant playi refunded and its okgame is goodbut go with care
Hell this game made me uninstall H1Z1 the moment i bought it Never looked back Great communication from developers what is happening they do listen to the community Gun mods realistic car mechanics and of course China is no1
Jump out of planeloot buildingsrun to make it to circle in timeget killed right when you get there and repeat
good gamebut need hope more  optimizationif there are more cars 
PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is a solo or team survival arena game Squad up with your pals or lock in by your lonesome to combat 99 other players24 other teams to be the owner of a winner s chicken dinner It all starts out funny as everyone sits in the lobby dicking around and slapping the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of eachother Once the lobby is full everyone gets in the C 130 Cargo plane and swallows their mic letting out their warcry After skydiving to the ground everyone is pitted against eachother in a race for gear and vehicles As time passes the battlegrounds are slimmed down forcing combat between players Whoever is last standing takes home the gold
I ve put in nearly 300 hours into this game to finally come to the realization that this game is hot garbage  Game disconnects pretty much every round since the latest update buggy gameplay vehicles that for no reason will flip over cheaters servers being too busy to connect toI tried to give Bluehole a chance but instead of fixing their game they add weapon skins    Exactly what the user community was clamoring for
runs to slow for my computer
CANT WAIT FOR FIRST PERSON MODE
I don t want to evaluate this trash game anymoreCrash bug lag and hacker are all about your gaming experienceBy the way all the game update Bluehole did is the new clothes
Not even NASA can run this game 1010
Very addictive game wheither you are with your friends or on your own every game is differentBare in mind that you will need a  good pc to run it well and also its a bit pricey Other than that its 100  worth the buy
Good concept addictive gameplay tense fire fights Game needs polish as expected
good game addicting   get loot see circle is 20 mins away find bike go fast flip over diepretty cool ma dude
I played it at a friend s house and it was extremely fun However I can t recommend it in the alpha state I always tell myself not to buy alpha games but this game pulled me in with its gameplay Unfortunetely it is the most poorly optimized game I think I ve ever played On a computer that can run the Witcher 3 Skyrim Fallout 4 etc the game is basically unplayable with the fps drops and sound glitches I ve done every troubleshoot I can find and think of but alas it is all for naught I really hope that fix these issues because it seems like a great game
its getting really boring after the first 300 hrs
This game made my review good
YEAH BRO GOOD GAME EXCEPT FOR THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING FULL AUTO I LL BE HOLDING THAT LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  DOWN AND JUST HAVE IT STOP AFTER 2 BULLETS GO LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOURSELF BLUEHOLE FIX YOUR GAME
PUBG is a thrilling adrenaline pumping experience in which you need to be the last team  man standing on a medium   large island out of a 100 people When you win your first game I gurantee you it will be some of the best feelings you will ever have in all of your years of gaming However recently there has been a rather large issue and it is NOT ignorable Let me tell you what it isPUBG is a great core game there is nothing wrong with it It is people who play the game and the way the developers develop their game Recently alot of hackers have began to pop into matches and haven t been suffering consequences like they should PUBG at the moment is working on this so this should be solved soon However this is something that will take either a long time to fix or never will be fixed and will cause quite some rummage in the reviews discouraging people to buy the game Optimization bugs glitches My computer cannot run this game above 50 fps although I guess I have an average card it isn t nessecarily bad and can run Unreal Engine 3 on maxed out settings 1080p Unreal Engine 4 is a horribly unoptimized engine there is alot of proof on the internet to back this up Although I can run many Unreal Engine 4 games PUBG is one of those games where no matter what I do I cannot provide myself a stable 30 fps My specs are I7 3770 350ghz 16GB Ram DDR3 and lastly my card  which is the issue AMD Radeon 6950 2gb HD Sapphire FleX Edition I understand I am using an average card and I have a massive bottleneck but I still believe with my specs I should be able to achieve atleast a 30fps stable framerate at lowest settings possible  editing engine files to provide better fps I still have managed to win multiple games however there are some moments where I can heavily blame my fps for why I died As for bugs and glitches I haven t experienced a whole bunch BUT I have experienced the most with VEHICLES Colliding a car with another at high speed will result in something unpredictable I remember I did this one time and I literally merged with the other car and then jumped out and then died by getting hit by my own vehicle and then shortly after see the other guy in the car die to his car exploding Another pretty large thing is hit registration Although I m not an expert on netcode I can tell you this  It s awful Multiple times I have been in full cover and still have died There is around a 2 second delay with the hit registration and my most frusturating moment with hit reg was when I whipped around because I was getting shot and sprayed someone with my M249 and I hit him 7 times and he didn t die ended up killing meLastly they have been slow with updates Why  They ve been developing the game for the Xbox One and focusing less on PC build Developing builds for console is FAIR however if the PC build isn t even proper why would you start on another console build wtf  On top of that PUBG releases out of Early Access in December hinting that they are very likely to ignore optimization bugs and glitches There are monthly updates and they sometimes barely present anything worthwhile in an update They only have one month left to release an update that addresses ALL of this  going in with the assumption of they re not going to update as heavy when out of EA and if they don t there will be some HEAVY negativitey about this gameIn conclusion PUBG is an amazing game at core however there are some things needed to make this game a full and proper one
The only game that s so fun to the point where it outweighs the fact that it runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Never written a review in the 15 years I have been using steam Most fun I have had in a game since the original team fortress or quake or battlefield bad company 2 Yea its been a while since I have enjoyed a game so much GET THIS GAME AND PLAY WITH FRIENDS most fun you will ever have I promise
Better than h1z1
The devs put in paid content
Heres a review for youI dont care about another LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ingt floral jacket or a god damned emoteFix the cheating and fix the reconnect issue i have everytime a game endsFIX THE BUGS THEN add your floral jackets and emotes45
This is a bad game
a fun game but really bad servers  sd
910 would play with your mom again
You jump from the plane with little mare than your goofy clothes on your back you hit the ground and if your not superman punched imidiatly you find what ever gun you can find or get shafted by the three empty houses that have nothing but gun grips and clothes that for some reason look more stupid than the rags the game gives you to begin with you find your M16A4 and embark on your quest to be THE LAST MAN SAND no you got shot in the head from somewhere you have no idea where it came from because you suck at this game BUT you start another one because as bad as it is cocaine is addicting as      1010 would die againDont like paying for crates  DONT BUY CRATES I know crazy concept
Game is pretty fun It s addicting too But one of the issues I have with this game is that whenever I spectate a teammate and when that person aims it dosnt show me what they are looking at It glitches out and only shows me what they were aiming at first After that whenever they aim it just goes back to that first screen of what they were aiming at first Second problem with spectating is that when I m in squad and spectating one of my teammates and then he ends up dieing I can t switch players and view the other person who is alive on my team I find this very annoying and frustrating I know this game has a lot of work cut out for itself but these are just some of the annoying little things I find aggravating Instead of creating new guns and maps maybe you should polish this game up a bit more
This is one of those games I m going to keep going back to for many years I was incredibly disappointed with DayZ this game improves upon it greatly
Loved this game but am finding my self stearing away from it lately so i havent played any of the recent updates Its a great game to play with your squad but its not a perfect game by any means and after 400 hours i can confirm that it does indeed become a chore to play
If you re thinking of buying H1Z1 King of the Kill then buy this instead it has bettter graphics better gameplay better optimization better servers and it doesn t have micro microtransactions it gets updated weekly with small tweaks and 1 bigger monthly update H1Z1 King of the Kill has been out since 2016 and it rarely gets any updates the developers just suck as much money as they can out of those microtransactions this game has been out since 2017 and offers alot more content buy it its the best battle royale style shooter
Most addictive multiplayer experience since the good old days of CoD without the big company LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t THIS is how Early Access should be  Looking  u DayZ
This is a fun game makes me rage at times when I m shot from outta nowhere like an RKO and performance could be better I play a lot of games majority on max settings and get 200 fps but don t get anywhere near that on very low I would still recommend my friends to buy it as it s enjoyable all the same just has minor issues that will be ironed out over time
very bery good games i r8 1010 m8

The Developers of this game have done a tremendous job  tremendous jobi mean a fantastic jobthe hardwork and dedication is truely stunning
Remove third person and I ll rate positive edited rated positive
A battle royale game that isnt as bad as the others
Es ist nice da Spricht nichts gegen aber ja dieses aber tja was soll man anders zu dem jetzigem Zustand des Spiels noch sagen
Best Battle Royale game1010
A great game with potato servers and a LOT of cheaters
Well I got in game item worth 4 twice in a row  then i sell it to buy my brother a copy of PUBG  Thanks2322018 Update  Well I Missed Alot Things in PUBG in Early Access Such as Weather The Old Fonts Bring the rain back please
Very nice game overall vehicles need a little work everything else is doing wonderful scenery could be more dense as well
when i install the game it doesnt worked what a problem 
This game is very nice but i will not write here pros and cons but my experience from my FIRST game I landed in small village There was good loot  scar vests backpacks etc I felt like unstopable force with these amounts of bullets and great weapons I also found military car And then i saw drop so i drived there i looted crate and then  one guy with no equip but with shotgun killed me with 1 shot in my back  or 2 dont know now So what i want to say is in this game you are never save never know if somebody is scoping you Its a lot about tactics and luck to find good loot Only thing that is bad about this game is its price because 30 euro for multyplayer battle royale game is too much I know it is still in early acces but games like rust have much more content for better price Oh and i almost forgot about Lags and on lower spec computers texture mish mash mostly on houses but still this is a great game and i recomend itThat was what i wrote around 3 months ago Now the game is out and its buggy as hell Its just unfinished Do i have to say more  When in early acecess 810Now 510 is max i can give it
Favorite this game
i tried all soultions im running a gtx 970 and a i7 6700 and the game keeps on freezing and crashing i tried all specs modes please help the game is fun for the 3 mins a game i can play
1010 would smash my desk again after not being able to hear footsteps over the rain map and get gay d in a f   ing corner
Would not pay a dime for this
A lot of excitement Your heart is racing all the time And your eyes are always wide open wondering if someone is right around the corner
PUBG is a really good game for anyone looking for a more stategy based shooter It is one of the best if not the best battle royale based shooters that i have ever played The only reason I might tell somebody not to get this game is because either  AThey don t like strategy based games or  BThey are obnoxious and would be a harm to the community So if you are on the fence about getting it and don t fall into categories A or B I would say that it is worth getting
I LIKE THIS GAME A LOT BUT WHAT I DON T LIKE ABOUT THE GAME IS THAT IT S NOT SMOOTH ENOUGH  I HAVE A STRONG PC THAT CAN  RUN ANYGAME WITH THE BEST PREFORMENSE
This game is great Can t wait for new updates
leuk man
This game is great at one thing and one thing only   lagging and CRASHING Mostly CRASHING But lagging is good too Out of last 8 games i played the game crashed 4 timesServers are garbage Gameplay is pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  too its mostly consists of lag and getting killed around cornersOverhyped mediocrity  and a lot of buthurt due to constant crashes Wouldnt advise buyingEdit  its been  almost a year and ii am 600 hours deep but the game is still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    tons of CHEATERS problems with ping a lot of stupid things that need fixes that are being ignored by the developers like hitting unseen object when you are driving getting hurled in the air while you are riding on  perfectly flat road on a bike w sidecar getting shot around corners  having your shots not register not being able to pick up  loot getting stuck while landing on a parachute  and or getting damaged the list just goes on and on but instead these blueholes ad emotions skins and other useless garbage oh oh and my favorite one     getting an update that kills your fps what a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bunch these bholes are
Got a lot of loot with my budKilled him runing over him with a boat at 1kh revived himWe got a ton more lootHe killed me with a boat at 1kh he revived me We stoped at sea to loot plane dropGot a lvl 3 bagAll my stuff felt to the ocean floorMy friend killed me with the boat at 1kh reverseim crawling in the botton of the oceanHe swims there and revive meBoat get stucked on rocksWe get out of boatI get stuck on rocksCamera is flickering up and down can t get outFinally manage to get out shooting with my AWP with 8x aimPeople hear that and shoot and kill us from uphill
Great game great community feedback Can t wait for the new maps
It s fun when it works but it s a full time job to keep it working
Obviously I like the game as I have played far more than I should have over the course of a monthIs the game glitchy at times  YESIs it optimized for best graphics and FPS  NO  not yetWhen the glitches happen to you or to others will you be either infuriated or laughing so hard you might bust a rib  Emphatically YESI can t begin to describe how terrible the vehicles in the game are where you think you are safe driving at speed only to realize either your jeep can do more cartwheels through the air when you strike an invisible rock  than a Circue  Du Soliel performer on Crack  or come to the conclusion that you are riding around in a unbelievably loud Steel Deathtrap of explodey proportions Or when you try to escape a firefight and drive away as bullets are ripping through both steel and flesh as your car takes about 45 seconds to reach blazing speed of 12 kphOr how after parachuting from the aircraft and  landing on a roof with 3 teammembers and realizing they are not YOUR teammembers as they beat you to death with their fists while your actual teammates continue to loot and ignore your pleas for helpYou need to play it for yourself Grab some friends get this game and have an absolute blast learning the in s and outs of PUBG Highly recommend9510
dying to a VSS vintorez that fires 9mm rounds never felt better
nice and fun game
Great game even thoe it s in early develop
Will cure crippling depression and cancer 911 would spend 20 minutes looting just to get juan tapped by an AWM 2 kilomiters away again
PUBG is well it s a game but not really a good one it s pretty difficult to say what it isI found almost no fun in it it felt like a chore I think it has Pay2Win elementsYou should probably refund it
this game sucks reaaaaaalty big big LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because when i play it i get shot alot and i think that is kind of discrimination because when i was 4 years old old old older oldest olden boy little tot little toddler my dad shot me with a 12 gauge assault rifle pump action militAary grendae shooter real big gun and when i play games i dont want tro touch myself
I played it for a bit and I found alot of joy in running 12 year old white boys over with cars then t bagging for several minutes before getting shot in the head from several meters away resulting in severe brain damage and living out the rest of my days as a cripple until the inevitable day I find god allowing me to review this game
So this is probably the best game i have played in years to start off it does have its bugs and flaws but over all even already it is amazing i came from ps4 and built my rig just for this game and it was worth it there is no such games on xbox or ps huge lobbys with 100 people you can go in solo duo or a squad so its amazing alone or with friends the people for the most part in the game have been great and helpful thank you so much for making this game and keep up the good work cant wait for zombie mode even though i wish they were AI zombies but ether way  ALSO I HAVE 50 HRS IN THIS GAME SO THIS IS A REAL REVIEW WORTH LOOKING AT
grass grass grass
very good game love itIf the server is imporved it would be great and btwGTX1060 only has 55fps on avg with all very low
While this game still has some rough edges as one would expect from an early access game it is well worth its priceIf you have played DayZ Battleroyale you will also enjoy this game The gameplay is less hardcore but also way less clunky When first person modes is included by default this game will probably offer the best Battle Royale experience yet
Gameplay can be fun I ll admit But Bluhole isn t going in the right direction with making people pay 250 to unlock crates they ve earned through gameplay You can t trade these skins online anymore
Reigon lock is needed and SA servers  at this point the game is pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and I will not play again
my teammates taught me chinese better than duolingo
From Invisible Shotgun shot glitches To Missing clothes and Armor This game is Absolutely Terrible How the developers sleep at night with this garbage released the World may never Know Top overall player charts or not there is Hardly any Content MANY MANY gunplay glitches Collision is Horrifying trying to jump over broken walls and barbed wire is Sickening The Anti Cheat  Battleye  has been compromised many months ago There is only one positive Bullet Physics are Outstanding Drag and Drift are very Realistic Hopefully since this is  Beta  they fix these issues but honestly this is Unreal Engine   How is there this many issues    I cannot recommend simply because of the Physics alone Needs a LOT of work Think before dropping a whopping 29 bucks on this Hastily built quickly boring  Beta 
such excitement much fun
Do you have too relaxed life Do you want to be a little more paranoic And mostly do you own headphones If all answers were yes then you are ready to start with this game100 people including you are thrown onto an island Not actualy thronw so you can choose where you land Then you run around looking for anything that shoots in worse case scenario you try to avoid or beat to death other players before THEY can find any weaponAfter this part random part skill based start you check map wheater you have to run fastest as you can to the safe area or you chose well and dont have to move at all In first case you run or drive if lucky or other players where so kind and did not shoot thru every car wheel they saw before they left If you are already in the safe zone its even worse There are probably more people than just you and they all want more loot same as you You are before a dilemma leave your safe spot looking for loot risking being shot at or stay there and being shot a little laterYou deside to leave and cear up You find something you really like and feel invincible at least for a few secs Then you realise a lot of people did the same Your ears and eyes are you biggest friends atm you look for a slightest movement or sound You scare yourself a few times but thats expected You continues to smaller circle You happen to see someone having the same strategy as you but left his building just moments before you You shot him into his back He falls and dies instantly You feel good you sadist You grab his stuff and continues on your jouney into the whiteThats it only you and several other people You chose a spot for camping and if you are lucky you wont have to move until the end You have to move in the next minute You have to decide once again if you will move immediatly or wait and risk not being in time but having nobody in your back most probably at least You decide to wait After few moment you decide not to wait and move forwardThats it you moved and now its you and only few more people you scout the area but see noone You hear shots constantly You are ready with your upgraded weapon You see an enemy He is shooting Somebody dies and he hides behind a tree You aim and wiht three quick shots you kill him You feel great You hear shots And you are dead You feel sad Just two trees next to you was somebody hidden You finished 3rdYou are proud but disapointed that you made mistakeYou try again and you also die in first minutes you try again and again All attemts worse than your first oneBut you keep trying until you get to the last 3 people again and then you get shot againSolid 57 would try again
Quality game a few minor errors like high CPU output which crashes the game and sometimes the PC but only in the early stages yet hopefully they will fix this issue before the  official  release and I assume this will be a problem that is fixed before the console versions come out Superb game though highly addictive and I hope they finish this project as it could be a massive franchise
Game is overall really fun and barely possible to beat optimization has serious bugs but I expect this from a greenlightOverall i would recommend this game to anybody who likes the hunger games
Hot game

Best of it s kind either you like battle royale or you don t
Honestly I love this game expect there is of course there are flaws and the one thats most concerning to me is the fact that you can barely shoot through the fence and now the vaulting sometimes glitches and you get stuck in a corner or something and end up dying  due to zone or just quit because you can t move
I have never done an in depth review so here I go The game tho in early access is in my opinion well worth the money It is not filled with stuff and modes maps or anything for that matter but at the rate this game gets large and fairly big updates and patches It feels like a new experience often Pros  You can feel the love for the game small details like  The gasmask changes appereance your headwear Theres is an animation for shifting between single and auto fire  At least on AKMThe graphics are nice I have not seen anything that is left behind graphic wise yetThere are always someone to play with and against most are nice people tooThe pacing in a round is beautifully crafted and fair  Tho the random drop is sometimes against me To me that is just a challenge of changing tacticsThe controls are good not much to learn if you have played a shooter Does not seem wonky to me Negative The game is not optimized very good  Yet Sometimes the parachuting bugs out for me and i float above ground  Tho after 10 seconds it gives me the possibility to cut it looseI felt like the graphics seems blurry but if you work with the graphics you can get some sharp egdes  Took me some time but got it workingThis game is all worth while you play the game it gets repetetive and just as you were done a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing WoW sized DLC drops for free Boom new game mechanics if this game do not leave Early Access I have still gotten so many hours out tof it i do not regret the price i paid
Hasnt worked for 6 weeks for various issues i7 brand new comp tried everything
This game still needs a lot of fixing it is filled with bugs or stuff that simply doesn t work Sounds seem random and character customization is a joke and adds nothing prices are way to high for what you get and you get less than a 5  return rate for duplicates no reason for duplicates to exist in the first place tho Right now it is Not worth the asking price and it will need a lot of work before it gets even close
I really wanted to defend this game against Fortnite as the  better battleroyal game  While I enjoy the game I have been strugling to do so after the full release People are begging for better servers better optimization and less microtransaction but instead they add more microtransactions ruin trading and sue Epic Games for having a more successfull game Really   I still dislike Fortnite but the devs are 10 times better at Epic Games adding new stuff and not sueing Radical Heights for being quirky and battleroyal I feel like I m just playing the same game I got last summer because the devs refuse to add new LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to the game I won t be touching this game for a really long time cause they have only been adding microtransactions for the last god knows how many updates instead of adding new content
The Culling 20
booo
So After wasting a bit of my time in this game it s time to review it If you consider buying this game and you played games like arma  dayz you ll fell right at home  based on opinions from few of my friendsNot only if you played those games I haven t Yet i still bought it and I enjoyed this gamePROS  Easy to learn Hard to master Game gets regularly updated devs definitely take care of it it s really fast to get to another match even if you lose early New features  guns are added in updates as well as lots and lots of bugfixes Game is fairly balanced in terms of loot in certain areas  better guns spawn rarely or not at all in secluded areas encouraging players to land in dense areas and to fight early on Game looks good  but it has downside s as well Playing solo can be boring after sometime and repetitive but playing in squads is one of the better gaming experiences i ve had in a whileCONS  Optimalization is terrible Buy it only if you have really beefy PC  in my case i have 1060 with i5 and i get between 70 to 90fps on low Terrible Game is really expensive for what it is 30 waaaaay to expensive for most people After all you pay 30 for an unfinished product in EARLY ACCESS  at least it s said it will exit EA near end of 2017 lets hope it will stay that wayBottomline  If You want to play a true battle royale game in it s purest form this game will be perfect Just be aware it s still in infamous EA so anything can happen
Not yet This game is great there s no denying it I do however think you should really consider buying it before you do Performance while not unplayable is very poor especially on the current recommended requirementsServer performance is also very flaky which adds to the poor client end performanceSure if you have a 4690k and a 1080ti then you ll get better performance however you will still observe massive frame dropsThe game and gameplay are really good however and surprisingly addictive however with only one map and a handful of weapons the experience does get repetitive fastI will revise my review once the game has left eary access  if it ever does as is the fate with many early access games however for now I wouldn t recommend it to the average consume who s scrolling through steam
What can I say I hate this gameI hate for being greedyIt is buggy it has a huge amount of cheater but hey every month new lootboxes but no real new content
If you like dying a lot and wasting money GOOD GAMEedit and getting team killed and lag and not getting matched with a teammate or having your teammate quit
Tis LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in lit m8
A very fun game but it got both  and   Comfortable map not like h1z1Very easy to find stuff and keep everything in check oftenYou can be revived by m8sSimply fun Poor optimized but it s still EA so in the future it will be better Hard to find vehicles etc Invis people
Better than h1 lol
NOT OPTOMIZED WELL
I know this will be drowned under a bunch of lolz reviews but I must say this game is not very goodIts success is mostly meme factor as far as I can tellWhy is it not a good game in my opinion  Gunplay is not very funMidgame is the waiting gameGraphicsPhysics are worst then games from 2009When it is fun its only because you are doing it with friends Which says nothing about the game even the worst games are fun with friendsWorst thing is that the game is not even long enough to create stories you will later recall of epic holdouts Even moments that seem to be exciting at first become repetative due to the nature of the rounds and will not leave a lasting impressionGame loop is Run and find wepons before someone kills you  kind of funMid game wait until the play area shrinks  kind of boringLast one to get noticed wins  not fun due to bad gunplayIf all of your friends have it and you dont want to be left out sure buy this game There are worst things in lifeBut if you can convince them to play something else together or you plan to play it alone I would strongly recommand a pass
Amazing game sooo much fun and sooo addictive but the optimization omfg soooo bad in optimization pls fix it so that more players  can enjoy this incredible game
This is a horrible game It is full of hackers and cheats The desync and horrible lag is one thing but the more I play it the more I suspect that each update is more broken than the last Add to that we get these cute loot crates that are locked now and keys cost more than most of the crates Instead of adding cute new clothes or weapon skins it would be worth more just to fix the crap that is broken
fantastic game very fun
Best BR ever played
its not good hi Rostovne
ping
Everyone on my friends list owns this
A really good game 1010
Exciting multiplayer gameplay and loads squad jazz clunky controls and a lot of bugsAssets are all bought from the Epic Games Store now they want to sue them cause of  copiying  their idea I can see why people are playing Fortnite BR its free its more original and its more fun and actionpacked What you get here is just a running simulator developed by a greedy company510
good game but still need more optimization and fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing crashes
RIP PUBG CHEATERS EVERYWHERE
This game is very fun and addictive If you like H1Z1 KOTK Arma 3 BR then this is the game for you Is it another battle royale except in my opinion more realistic and addictive I can t stop playing when I start playing There are a few bugs that could be fixed but other then that it s a really solid game
Out of all the recent early access games I have played this has been one of the most fun experiences This game is great to play with friends and even by yourself although it is more fun with a team The game is not without it s bugs as you would expect with an early access game but that s what we re here for

I like a lot about the game  There is one very big  issue that keeps bothering me  I like multiplayer games for many reasons one being customization of your playeable character  You see that trend in most games now  COD Overwatch etc  The issue i have is that it takes a loooooong time to earn BP  point system used here to earn enough to buy a  crate  to unlock a customizeable item  like a shirt or mask  I ve put in a few hours in this game and have done fairly well  between top 5 and 20 still alive in most matches and i ve only had enough for 2 crates  One crate i got a white tank top  yesplain white and the second was a black tank top  If that wasnt bad enough each time you buy a crate the next crate doubles in price  I just purchased a crate for 700 points and now the next one is 1400  So let s recapit takes a long time to get points the content of the crate is mediocre  spelling is probably not right and it gets more expensive every time  WT Eff  It would be great if the items you find during the game could come back with you  at least one item or if the points system was revamped  Honestly it s nothing more than the developers being stingy  I can t imagine that the developers havent realized that it is standard in every game for there to be a high level of customization  it helps with replay valueAnyways thanks for making it this far into my review
While I m not that great at this game its a blast I can t wait until that game is complete
5050 chance to enjoy the game Your options    land isolated and find 5 T shirts Trousers Gloves and Energy Drinks maybe a Pistol  land with others and u got a 1 8 chance of being the first to get a good weapon to win a Confrontation  land near a House or a Farm carefully looking that you re the only one there and gear up  5050  getting a decent weapon  but then    Running Simulator  No vehicles and the Game Area is on the other side of the IslandDont get me wrong It actually IS fun if u survive the first 10 minutes and you re lucky to be in Game area after that timeBut wasting an hour or two to actually get there is bonkers This game is frustrating and way too luck basedNo recommendation wasted 30  on this sad
broken as f   
REALY GOOD GAMENEED TO FIX MINOR BUG AND NEED SOME UPDATE ON UI BUY IT BECAUSE SEEN PEWDIEPIE AND ADMIRAL BULLDOG PLAYING IT SO MUCH FUN AND GAME
Can t even finish a game get to top 10 and it crashes wait for it to come out of early access
collecting bans since 99
this is a great game i just wish my laptop could operate it at a higher quality so i could enjoy it even more
The game itself is superfun to play   but there is cheaters in every match you play using esp and aimbot and no recoil hack it is so obviously when you watch the replay
1st map is decent 2nd map is absolute sh   I refuse to play it until they fix the lag or region lock countries to help the server lag Maybe if they start fixing the game and stop worrying about money so much i will gladly play it more like i used to
1010Best online survival game one has to offerWas enjoyable already when I first bought it in march  30fps with GTX1070  It has really good fps now with the monthly updates and optimization I m very greatful of the team working hard on keeping up their promises
verry xd
Despite never actually getting the game to load fully I d say that it looks really good online I don t know what s up with the game not loading either because my specs are good and I have the settings on low Any known solutions 
Hide and go seak PSTD simulator My girlfirend can t walk up behind me when I play this game I am now hyper aware of EVERYTHING in life I can t walk into a room without looking for a guns and scanning my corners 1010 would play all day long
i like the gameplay of the game its really amazing than h1z1 and its also still early access and its too good to be true but i still got performance issues so yeah
Overall this tops most other games that I have played on the PC I notice a lot of the times my adreline goes through the roof trying to sneak up behind someone or hiding in a small room as I hear footsteps come into the house that I am in Thus far the pros in the game outweigh the current cons in my opinion Keep in mind the game is still in early access and some of these are nothing abnormal or anything to be blamed on the devsCONS  Very little optimization Lower end PC s will NOT be able to run smoothly at all in the current state There are some issues with loot spawn right now ie loot will not spawn right when landing Players are able to reshade the game file thus making it easier to see other players  Somewhat Cheating  This one may relate back to the optimization problems but players who play on low graphics settings are able to see proned and distant players easier due to lack of foliage and trees On the contrary plaerys who play on the higher end of the spectrum are put at a disadvantage due to the fact that players can hide in bushes and grass and behind tress in the distance This will possibly be addressed in future updates but it will be a tricky patch none the lessWith cons out of the way it s now time for the goodPROS   The game enviroment is just all around amazing Maybe people may view this game as dropping down out of an airplane to pick up guns to kill other players but it is so much more than that This game involves tacticts good positioning and heavy HEAVY awareness of your surrondings at ALL times The game is slower paced compared to the likes of H1Z1 but heavier on tactical advantages and disadvantages which also makes fight s very thrilling experience The game does currently over three different team ques  SoloDuoSquad With all three of them having their own unique playstyle and feel The devs are on top of this game all of the time The game sees tons and tons of patches  which is why i am not too worried about the optimization issues as any early access game will take a while to fix up Most of the time we see around a patch a week and sometimes even multiple patches over the course of a week This one may just be me as well but the game is in Early Access which means getting it now sets you up with the experience of seeing the game grow over the next few years to comeTechnical  The game is CPU heavy so make sure it can keep it before buying The min req for a GPU s vram is 2GB but if you do not have atleast 4 it will struggle Texture in this game will plow through your memory so I recomend having 16 or more Remember this is just the current state in future updates the game will be optimized and these specs will not be needed completley though it appears the game will remain pretty demandingI could not recomend this game enough 1010 for me
Starts a game it crashesThankfully it s early access but clearly there are some things that needs to be fixed
 I m the snake follow me 
The best worst game ever Ever
 goes in a lobby  Shouts to 100 people  I have added paul walker on Xbox the other day  Lobby goes scilent  I cant play with him tho hes stuck on the dashboard  Whole lobby laughs calls me a legend and had almost diplomatic immunity for the whole of the game 1110 would be insensitive again
This game is pure garbage I hate it so much
 Join  squad  game with randoms we are three i find a car with two sits i was just lookin  for another car with one of my mates i get shot without warning by my mate he takes the car an join his friend1010 would get shot by a mate for a         car

Too much hype for a game that s totally based on luckNeed IP block  mainly for Chinese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Bought it only for selling cratesLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  gameAnd China ain t numba One
This is the game that I m waiting for so long I got really excited and attacted to this game when one of my friend introduced to me It s the best game ever because it s such a  realistic yet science fiction game I really love it and most of my friends have the same feeling attracted with me when i told them that our dream game is now available on steam suggestion  this game should available in offline mode  so we can play pubg anytime and we don t need to play other game when we are boring should add more weapon update more place and weatherHopefully my suggestion does help Lastly THANKS TO CREATE SUCH A GREAT GAME IN THE UNIVERSE  
If your computer sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE  like mine you cant even play the game Imma recommend this game lnly if you have a good computer
Okay so I reviewed this game a few months ago in a salty fit of frustration babbling on about the game s several glitches and bugs rather than reviewing the game for what it is Pubg is everything KOTK wanted to be but ten times better This game has so much replay value and everygame is different This game gets a lot of flak from the community for its issues and people rarely praise Bluehole for the amazing job they ve done This game has came so far in the past months in terms of bug fixes  sure it s not perfect BUT it is well worth the buy Despite the fact that Brendan Greene  PLAYERUNKNOWN is kinf of a cuck GG bluehole
Over priced for the amount of content
The only reason this game is getting thumbs up is because its better than H1which is garbage and because streamers play it Just because a streamer plays a game does not make it a good game nor does it make it worth 30 ffs However if you have seen ANY gameplay on youtubetwitch you would know this game is far from good Its still so unfinished with rediculous amounts of glitchesdsync issues ETC DO NOT spend 30 on this game wait untill its on sale for around 10 than i would say it is worth barely Yes i only have 113 hours on record however it doesnt take more than 3 or 4 games to realize how unfinished and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game is
personally this is the best game of 2017 so far i wont list the reasons because all oyu need to do is watch a couple streams of it and you will realise how good this game is also it gets frequent updates which is always good regionlockchina
Very entertaining Relatively smooth gameplay Surprisingly well paced
Holy Sh t This game gives you anxiety but in the best way possible Always looking for the next best gun while making your way to the safe zone Its the hunger games but with modern weapons 1010My best experience was  the resticted zone is closing in on me It passes me and I find a car out of nowhere and drive as fast as i can to the safe zone before I die I barely make it and end up taking 7th Best performance so far and dang was it fun
Fell out of planeLanded on a very unfriendly islandFound a frying pan in a small hutProceeded to bash said frying pan into the first person I came accrossWas verbally assaulted by said person  gender and sexual preference was questionedDied shortly after to a crossbow bolt1010 Would definately get insulted again
Fun game with friends
Great game m8 buy it
400 hours on game my opinion dont bought 80  hackers and always bugsss sry  3
The only  updates  they make now are to add more crates that require money to open This game is free to play trashNow installing Fortnite  
I want to like this game so much but it is just a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game and I wish really that I can meet the devs and blast there brains over this game
igra govno grafon zhopa
Jump out of the plane scurry to collect weapons race to stay in the conflict area avoid the bombs over and over again To much time collecting weapons just to lose them and have to start over again I feel like I just threw 2995 in the toilet Not the game for me Also seem to be some players that appear to have one shot one kill headshot ability on a regular basis Something isn t right there
This game restored my faith in early access
Perty good game better than H1Z1
better than H1Z1  however still buggy atm

  PUBG oxyeNNo   D  10 FPS10    Recommended for buying
Amazing game Would buy again Recommend to all my friends
PUBG the H1Z1 killer and the next big eSport for kill arena games Love this game super excited for the future it holdsThis game and the company who makes it cares and listens to their community adding new content monthy Not just makin BS changes like H1Z1 
A game you ll love when you play It s so real 
like what the hell man it was bugging and lagging on my pc with 1050 ti and i5 7th genration pc but game is fantasic
It a good game Could use more optimization Mainly for FPP Other than that it s really fun Been playing on NA server and so far no cheater or anything like that Recommend it
So Far the best game of its Type I have played PLEASE KEEP IT UP DEVSI have played many of the games very similar to this  Most of them disappoint very quickly    PUBG is very different and the exceptionThe developers are active with the community and fix things quicklyThere are still several million people playing and the games are always FULL with never a delay getting inThere are great option of playing Solo Duo or squad  My only suggestion would be to add a Friendly fire penaltyGreat Game
The game seemed fun tried to get good at it but the bugs are killing me  My voice chat in game has never worked  Ive tried multiple soultions to this to no buano   So most squad groups just kill me cause my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dont work makes game suck LOVE LOVE LOVE    spent 30 on recomedation from a freind wish i just had my money back
This game is a whole lot of fun and i would definetely reccomend it to anyone whos looking for a well put together battle royale game
I can live my dream of being a white guy with an afro who goes skydiving in his underwear I give it a 1010 JarJar Trump Approves
Love it but rest of it is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  now
NICE 
I really enjoy the way its made even Early Access or not it s still awesome i have played a lot of king of the kill and last man standing kind of games and this is the best one of them gives a big addiction to it aswell  D
play fortnite much more fun I find zero ppl in this game
for 30 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing dollars you get a game THAT DOESNT LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING WORK IT IS BUGGED AS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing waste your money on this game unless you enjoy getting brutally assLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed thanks to the brain dead developers  OH BUT THEY ADDED WEAPON SKINS
I have a love hate relationship with Player s Unknown Player s Unknown loves to hate me most the time and sometimes it gives me a chicken dinner
Extremely overhyped Very fun at times but it really suprises me that another human being can stand more than two rounds of this game
Basically it s 40  looting 30  running 20  fighting and 10  pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ery probably the best game I ve played the last 7 years Obviously it has it s bugs and problems but generally speaking i d say it s one of the most complete Early Access games period Buy it man you won t regret it
As addicting as crack cocaine
This is probably the most interesting concept for a game This reminds me of a Japanese movie Battle Royals where you kill each other off until you re the last man standing This is a fun and addicting game where it requires you to manage your inventory and picking how you want to traverse the island until victory or death I highly recommend this game in it s Eary Access stage Highly competitive
AMAZING GAME
For me NO
i love this game so much funThis game is enjoyable even if you don t even get a kill in a single round1010
It s a Good Game You would have a lot of fun
g
Very Very Good Ya
the game is fun just wish it would load better
best game i have played in a long ime for being early access its amazing
Bans players for no reason or explination Refuses to own up to it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
Run n  shoot hide and crawl got to the last circle and sat in a bush to get 1
This game is fun don t get me wrongbut it s simply not worth 30 bucks There are literally thousands of other games that offer way more content and just as good of an entertainment value Here are the problems 1 Game has ONLY one map It s not that great just houses on a grassy plain 2 Game is buggyclipping looking through walls etc Lots of exploit opportunities3 Game is slow to load and is massively unoptimized Sure all this could change before launch day I sure hope it does for all the things this game does right But now I d say pass and go spend your 30 bucks on something you ll play longer than a few hours This game should be free in this state
VERY FUN especially with friends The battle royal game people have been asking for You may get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but you will always come back because dying is half the fun
its better than it ever has been thanks for the hard work hope more to come and that it gets even better
Asians are bad at this game  
Amazing game Nothing else to say so fun and addicting right at the start of me first trying any game like this Never played h1z1 or anything like this before always seen but never tried So addicting with my friends to play Love it
Highly recommend if you re into fast paced action and adrenaline rushes
I don t write reviews usually but this deserves to be recommended 1010 Although no SLI support runs at 60 70fps on high on just 1 x GTX970  AMD FX9590 46Ghz 16GB RAM Added bonus I ve met some life long friends and really good people in the pre game lobby and cargo plane drop In depth profound coverstations aplenty
directional sound extremely poor too much down time compared to combat encounters and benefits of camping create a dull game experience
Love It the best game ever
Terrible game Packed to the brim with Asians and hackers Glitchy not suitable for young players intentional friendly fire is extremely popular and u get banned regularly for no reason And u can be perminantly banned for no reason so this game literally steals your money Trust me I ve played this game enouph to know they only care about is getting your money There are tons of bad reviews for a reason don t get scammed like I did
what a bore fest
Look ok I m going to be honest this game has trashy and inconsistent mechanics compared to Fortnite Call me a Fortnite normie all you want but just know that buying this game is basically buying a lottery ticket deciding whether you will have fun The gun physics are simply to complicated and not fun half the game is walking unless you find a vehicle and overall I don t think the developers realised that to make a game of this scale fun you have to spread the action throughout a moderately sized map rather than having a huge map and concentrating actions on a select few areas Besides the more fun alternatives like H1Z1 and Fortnite are also in early accessbeta but are free giving this game no reason to be payed If you want a more easy to pick up and frankly better battle royale game then play Fortnite want a competetive battle royale play H1Z1 Want a more watered down version of both play this
this game sucks but its still better than fortnite
Nice and fun game to play with friends Nothing special just fun to play
This game is just plain BUGGYDon t buy this
it gave me the best LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
best survival game ever good monthly updates and it keeps getting better optimization 100  better than h1z1 fun played alone cause you can queue up with a squad
such a good game
I like verry much this game Very realistic simulator and feels like daily life in uganda
This game is honestly amazing It s fun and easy to pickup and play much more so than H1Z1 I was not good at H1Z1  I probably have killed less than 10 people in H1     However PubG is different I have only had the game for about 1 week and already I am competing well with the other players on the server with an average kill rate of around 5 people per match I higley reccomend this game to anyone who is intrested in purchasing it You won t be dissapointed  D
bought the game for it to tell me that the servers were too busy
fajna troche jak bys wchodzil na shorta ale przez godzine
This game loot is actually so bad that it takes years to find weapons
Great fun for casual gaming but if you actually wanna try and win you should LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing not Because this game is more luck than rolling a dye
Best stealth game ever
One of the best game I ever played
Fun but not complete
Action packed adrenaline packed game Very fun to play
Didn t think I d like it Caved into my curiosity and pear pressure love it
so fun must play more
Seems like it would be a fun game if it ever ran properly  Every game I ve played so far the game has been bugged  Got stuck in multiple walls and character movements were sporadic at best  Somewhat understandable for a game in beta but not for a game people are paying money to play
I played this game and I clapped
this game suckk lag everywhere
nicesosh
This game is very  fun as it is don t take it serious
this is the best game on steam i totally recomend this its worth the money 350 
The only game in a long time to get my heart pumping fast After looting up and stalking theres nothing better than getting a drop on another player in late game
This game is kinda what DayZ intended to be in a fast paced scenario It is fun to play if a potential early death in the game doesn t bother you  you can leave and rejoin pretty easilyEven more fun to play in a group of 2 or more then tactical thinking comes more into play   solo is mostly finding the best spot and being a little lucky at aiming   if you live long enough to be within the top10 it gets really intense and pulse risesHowever this game IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT It is playable but still movement seems a bit notchy  on foot as well as in vehiclesespecially in vehicleshitboxes seem to be a little bit off texture  may be wrong I percieved it like thatonly one map It is big but after a few hours ingame you ve been to most of the interesting locations and essentially know the map Another map or two won t hurt for sure
its honestly amazing one of the best games ever although it definately has couple bugs but the worst part is propably the autoaim hackers i mean they are like 3 buildings away and they kill you headhot with a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing handgun i mean jesus christ  Still lovely game
Fortnite but not bad
The feeling when you get a kill in this game in incomparable to any other battle royal game 100 times better than H1 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  1
The money is definitely worth the moments to create with your friendsSolo play is super fun and intense
This game is fun but there are too many hackers

It s a great game
NOT RECOMMENDEDMost perfect Early Access Game i even bought it since day one love it     3   this was the review when i bought the game before they LOVE LOVE LOVE  the game overthe game right now not smoth and they have servers like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE more cheatersmore grass removing glitch codes that remove grass from the game it s work like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i meet some people have it on and they showed me that early game lagg like hell in the end i don t recommended this game don t buy it
cheater game
Winner winner chicken dinnernice game 
This game is fun This game is intense HoweverThe game runs like absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on an i7 6850k48 with 32 gigs of quad channel ddr4 ram and 2 7970ghz editions which run every other game out there fineOther players always seem to have a serious advantage for no reason You can be sitting in an unlooted house with all the doors closed not moving at all and someone will just run in and headshot you before you even fully see themThe game is VERY buggy The vehicles flip and stop randomly from imperfections in the world model The player movement is absolutely atrocious it feels very clunky and poorly done You can be laying down and suddenly the game decides you cant be laying down anymore even if youre not moving giving away your positionOnce a player or duo or squad gets level 3 gear its game over They can take 4 shots to the face from shotgunsThe shooting in general feels very loose and sloppy its like the devs tried to make it realistic but have only seen guns in scary pictures they saw on the internet Pistols are more accurate than rifles somehow smgs become snipers and the assault rifles with scopes are about as useful as wet spaghettiThird person is way too much of an advantage Someone could be watching you from around a corner or out a window and you would never see themAlso something that should be pointed out is that bullets HARDLY ever go where youre aiming you could be laying down with an akm and shoot off a round and it will go a few degrees to the leftThe bullets also seem to come from the end of the barrel on guns so if someone comes right up in front of you and your gun sticks through them you wont be able to hit themDo not buy this game until its been smoothed over its just  yet another survival shooter  at the moment
The most fun ive ever had in a Battle Royal its better than H1Z1
I m a snake follow me10
i decided to update my review on this game i don t have a lot of playtime but here goesthis is a decent entry into the battle royale genre of games to say the least its fun to jump into solo or with a group and go a few rounds game seems kind of glitchy at times but thats expected in an EA game overall this is a pretty fun game and i got it after i returned a game im still not a fan of the price tag but i digress
GG Game
are you tired of disliking chinese people in secret looking for a way to make your hatred for the chinese known to the world look no further PUBG is the game for you
Gay
This gaem is what you call a time waster and a good kind of that I tried to win a chicken dinner by running over my enemies It almost worked  D
Fix this game Jesus Christ It sucks Kinda Mostly
Big fan of the gun play but the rng absolutely kills it for me
gey khina
Its laughable the current state of the game   Desync and nonexistent hitreg seem to be something usual  The terrible framerate is still there since launch  The huge number of cheaters looks like is not going to decrease any time soon  You will get at least 5 261MB updates a day changing nothing  The devs decide to add more loot boxes instead of fixing the game  Oh and the lawsuit that PUBG Corp has filed against Epic Games for copying the game is ridiculous They re crying just because other developers are more consistentsuccessful so they want to monopolize a genre Wow Lets see if you will also file a lawsuit against EA andor ActivisionBlizzard
SO MANY HACKERS if you want to play a fun battlegrounds game go play rules of survival i get killed by someone with no recoil ad autoaim from china every game
solid
PUBG is a great concept with extremely poor execution The engine this game runs on is archaic The game is choppy and terrible Don t buy it It could be so much fun but just doesn t run well
Rubbish game
Maybe fix issues instead of releasing more and more content
kek
Normaly I would give this game a thumbs up because I realy enjoyed it when I was playing it with friends but atm this game is full of cheaters  AutoAim players with no recoil guys who fist you from 100m away   In 50  of the games at least one of us got killed in a really supsicious way
just get fortnite mate
bluehole  bullshit asshole sounds more like full name of your company Kys rubbish korean company
THESE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  E R S NEED TO FIX THEIR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I N G GAME
Overall this game is by far one of my favorite games of all time but due the early access nature of the game It is buggy and still has a lot of work to be done Some things should already be done given the budget this game has earned the devs and the large amount of community feedback            recomendations of mine           get rid of random red zonefix the soundfix the resetting region and losing connection to lobbyhave objectives or a daily login or something so people have a reason to play other than it s funREGION LOCKINGremove the http loby menu for those wondering the lobby menu is a webpage loaded remotely and not apart of the application it s self this is why you have to reload the lobby and why there are so many problems with saving what gamemode you want to play or what perspective                cons                climbing windows inconsistantcars are made out of aluminum a motorcycle can launch a pickupbike with a side car crazy unstablerandom red zoneschinese hackers on NA serverspoorly optimizedtake damage for small bump while offroadingcars can fly rng is some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tnot optimized for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE                    pros              kills feal satisfyingyou don t have to jump around in circles and hope you get a headshotmost guns feel good to usereally fun with friendsoffers fpp and tpp  third personfirst person modesas time goes I will be updating my review
When a meme free game gets more players than your game because they actually update it every week and not once every 2 months just to add weapon skins and not fix your game
Latest big update LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up the sound of shots and steps so u can barely tell where u need to look to find ur enemy
This game would be great if they just went in and fixed the coding There are constant bugs and I m sure if anyone has actually looked at the code it would be a literal mess Even reskinning Fortnite and taking away the Minecraft aspect would be a better option for this game We are all sick and tired of the bugs but even moreso we are sick and tired of the hackersYou ll be doing great in a game have everything going for you and get killed with a single headshot through the wall or have someone speaking to you through allchat saying he knows your name and posistion and can tell you everything you re doing or most frequently have somebody snap right to your position as soon as they look down their sights The worst part is the only other game you can play that s anything like it is Fortnite and you just don t feel accomplished killing off 12 year olds who are just trying to build and run away from youAnd what do they do instead  Make more skins for the guns unbelievableIt is fun when things go right It can be good at times but the stability is trash the hackers are annoying and it s nowhere near worth the money you need to pay for it
Great game but please Bluehole                                     
This game forced me to get an SSD which I am thankful for But the game sucks

Better then H1Z1
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game bugs and chesters allover the place and money hungry game developers only focus on skins
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  what did you do with the PUBG if you re on so wake up doing something that will become a fortnite
not recommend this game waste money to buy still a lot of hacker in game The connection is very bad today i tried hundred times to log in game sv still busy then disconect
I m not recommending this game because the developers do not listen to the fan base and for the amount of money that has been made there should be several maps in rotation instead of just two and lots of new weapons  When you ve made multimillions of dollars you should be making the game a lot better  It s sad when the mobile version of this game has features that the pc version doesn t  Also cheaters ruin games like this on pc and it s pathetic when even a pro player at a pubg competition was caught using hacks It is a fun game for the most part but I see this game dying off and being replaced by newer games made by developers that listen to the community
I ve never seen a game function so badly after it has been released Optimization was horrible Half of the times I can t even play this game as it says  Servers are too busy please try again later  I would retry for more than 20 times and I still get the error message There are multiple bugs that cause this game to not even function The servers are garbage and sometimes it randomly freezes Other times the game just stops my teamates stop moving and I can t open doors or do anything This game also crashes a lot It s sometimes fun when it s PLAYABLE and I had a couple of chicken dinners Other times I can t even get past the loading screen Bluehole needs to stop adding new paid features when the BASIC parts of the game THAT MAKE IT A GAME can t even function properly
Takes a good pc to play rather smoothly but the game itself is fun Haven t encountered many hackers so its pretty good
this game is dying due too too much cheateri nvr been to a game that much hacker
I used to love this game But the overflow of hackers and PUBG s unwillingness to institute a method to decrease the amount of hackers over the past several months have heavily contributed to its decline With over a million bans one would believe that hackers would be less of a problem but they are still a problem and a very large one Hopefully the developers do pair some anti cheat software with the program in the future Until they do I would not recommend this game unless you enjoy spending countless hours getting shot through walls and hills by other s with aimbots
I LAIK DIS GAME FOR REALLL GAIISSSS 1010
previews are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t game still plays like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with 4 1080 ti s and they spend all their time releasing versions on xbox and mobile rather than fixing the day 1 bugs
This game is well thought out but poorly executed Apparently physics do not exsist and the plan of the day is carry 1000 grenades and randomly throw them to win the match Come on BlueBalls THINK
the game is like a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I think bluehole can t be called a gamework
Update more bug then fixed bugPerfomance badServer bad everGraphic badModel badPhysics very bad ever

This is the most thrilling horror game on steam
Fixed old problems recently like game not starting better optimazation THINGS ACTUALLY GO TO YOUR INVENTORY THE FIRST TIME YOU PICK THEM UP so thats nice would buy again maybe  D
REGION LOCK CHINAIMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY EVEN ON SOUTH AMERICAN SERVERS CHEATERS EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY GAME
i think this game is really good but im so confused because for some reason i can t change my region to EU I can only change them to NA and AS
This  game is full of cheaters Blue Hole did not do anything with this problem
The fact that another company did the same thing for free says a lot about charging us 30 bucks for this clunky game Battle royal should stick to being a game mode for other games
Finally has map selection No one has to play Miramar
Not a great game Basically fortnite battle royale but it lags more and looks more real If you really want the game go for it but its not worth what it is Just get the free battle royale fortnite
Very exciting game with lots of potential but could use a LOT of work Hoping they add map selection
Great BR game but needs work on it s bugs otherwise it s very addictive
Very Nice game  but now starting alot of HackerCheating Player  if can improve of that  this is are very nice game for all
its a good game but fertnet is really killing pubg
Goes Pecado dies within 20 seconds1010 would drop again IGN
This super fun game crashes constantly It s super buggy and poorly optimized Developers justify it s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  mechanics with the idea that it should be hard because it s realistic it is hard because it s awkward and constantly letting you down It s definitely potentially incredible with a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  load of bummer experiences mixed in The fighting is dope and exciting but you will hate this game at least half the time if not more Have fun getting good at it

POSTED  FEBRUARY 23                                    please
BUT CAN WE REIGON BLOCK CHINA 
One of the best games I have ever played It does make you rage but it is worth it 1010 I suggest that everyone plays this amazing game
Bit old and boring now
its too hard and so many hackers
I am a player who mainly plays on Asian serversNow I have to say a wordThis game operators garbageIt banned my game account for no reasonAnd I did not cheatMany cheating players are still at largeOperators no actSo I do not recommend this gameI hope that operators can replyThank you for reading
Disgusting laggy game with full lobby of campers
use to be something special now the game is just ruined fun while it lasted fortnite is king now
Reeee
wish i could refund this load of garbage but alas steam has rules
This un optimized pile of hot garbage can fro Honestly sad that I ve sunk so much time into it I m going to go live my life now
Developers are focusing on the wrong direction of this game Instead of optimizing their game they continue adding new mapsgunsskins while game has poor performance Better off playing Fortnite
Chicken
This game has potential tbh after playing for 80 hours I see there s still much to fix in this game Regarding about Chinese players using wallhacks and macros the anti cheat needs to be updated make it more stronger and these people need to be region lock  It ll be no hope if the chinese will use VPN to force match on other regions Desync is the most problem here either I took a shot on the player few damage taken or no registration at all after I hide to the wall  the player took a shot on my head and it was BS Between the client and the server side of the game it is frustrating because aiming have different position and this issue needs to be fix Bugs are still exist slow pick ups on items ran over by their own vehicle by leaving on small speed the deathcam isn t stable  sometimes it sees the player is not on aiming directly to others and mostly the cam is on different position and placed it on player s between it s eyes sliding on a top hill turned into a fall damage and etcWe gave our feedback to the developers but this how they gave our service to us  The only patches they gave to us is buggy as hell Crashing in game errors connecting to lobby and unnecessary feature such as emotes I ll give a time to play this again I ll be looking for more improvements and might change this review If the game is still crap I m pretty sure I ll give up playing this
i love this game very much but please im getting bored of the Miramar map give us a choice of map give me erangel please
even tho i have died every match ive played my first experiances were still fun as hell im sure over time ill get better
helloWhy do I seal my number I m a big fan of this gameI m an old player in the game tooIn this game I m very disgusted with the outsideI want the game to be very fairI ve never done a hang up eventI hope the blue hole company can give me an explanation my account is sealedLook forward to your reply
Microsoft ruined this game
If you re going to do an  EVENT MODE  can you start by region locking everyone  Try playing with 7 Chinese or Japanese speaking people in the 8 Man Squad Event IMPOSSIBLE
so a 8 man team but you cant make an  8 man squad with your freinds was is the point of it then
Since the last update the game crashes approx every 5 10 minutesThe game was more stable in Alpha stage
s  h  i  t GAME 
Untill there are no Chinese in the servers I would highly recommend this game The Chinese are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing destroy the game     They use hack    They spamming their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  language    They don t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing speak English        They are Unfriendly     They hates Vietnameses  Are they aliens                 
I prefer minecraft hunger games1010
This is a good game But  Bluehole  is not good enoughBecause China   Bluehole  has made a huge profitWhen he can t cope with the cheatThe  BlueHole  also leaves out those Chinese players who provide it with benefits Unresponsible Chinese players and cheater togetherThis will be the beginning of failure The BlueHole sees the biggest player community as troubleWhat s the difference with H1Z1 PUBG is not the only game of this kind of the gamesThe heat always coolsBecause China wonLosing China because of arroganceBecause the inability to lose playersWHEN IT HAPPENBlue Hole what  can you do else 
This game Put me 30 bucks in debtCaused me to break a keyboard Pros Fun with friendsFun without friendsCan have casual conversations with othersCons Can be killed by an underwear wearing frying pan weilding nutsack
broken as      and game is no longer in early access  Makes sense
Cheaters
AwesomeAddictive
Disclaimer   I love this game so my review may be biased a bit but I will try my best to give a genuine reviewSo PUBG was the game that brought me back to steam in 4 years and it was a refreshing experience unlike everything I had played before  and I ve played a lot and was the first time I made friends IRL and had fun with them in squads and duos The game undoubtedly stands up to the hype around it It is crazy fun and has its momemts of Unmatched GloryBut it still has it s flaws The game has improved a lot in the past few months and continues improving but still is not in a state of stability that it should have been in There still is a huge cheater problem that has been leading to people leaving  it for the inferior knock off  ahem ahem Fortnite anyone  The game has a learning curve It wont be easy for the first 20 Hours   was not for me but once you get the hang of it It s the most rewarding battle royale game out right nowTo sum it up it s the game to play right now and will be for quite some time in the forseeable future since we are getting two new maps and loads of content this year itselfSee you in the BATTLEGROUNDS Hope you like them chicken dinners    
i dont play this game anymore the people that made the game got their money and lost interest apparently there are multiple issues in this game that are not being addressed hacking desync high ping abuse regional lockout not happeningjust read some off the critical stuff on here then realize nothing is being done about any of it no one cares keep your money this is what happens to a game where the devs get rich before they actually finish the game
cause its good
This game sucks I head shotted a guy like 3 foot and it didnt regFIX YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAMEI uninstalled aswell
Game is way to big hard to see people and isn t for me is bare not so fun if you re looking for a battle royale game forenite this one is the worst power hungry laggy LOVE LOVE LOVE  game I have ever played
Every game I go into I end up dying almost instantly to someone who is cheating Thanks to the death cam I can watch as someone on the opposite side of the map shoots into the wall and kills 5 people in as row that arent visible Game is broken
REMOVE REDZONE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  COMPANY GAY

1 man squad giriyorum amk yerinde 4 kisi bi evin tum kapilarini kapatmis 1 oda da beni bekliyor orospu evlatlari sikerim oynicaginiz oyunu iqless orospu cocuklari
I really love this game and many other people do as well Its a blast to play alone and with friendsI highly reccomend this game but 2 things need to happen in the future 1 China needs Region Locking2 Bluehole needs to work more on optimizing the gameI d also love to see more guns and custom games for everyone
I feel like that if you have the money and you want to buy a survival last man standing game than this is the one to get gets 910 from me good job
In the new update The banners are very unfocused
just get fortnite its free and the developers of it are actually capable of removing cheaters and developing in general
I really enjoy playing this game both on xbox and computer One of my favorite parts is the strategic aspect and that is something that you just don t get from other FFAs like fortnite and h1z1 I have an RX 480 4gb graphics card and I can run the game on ultra with high frames  except in schoolThe only part that I don t like is the steam store money grab from the devs I enjoyed the free cosmetics but now I have to pay for EVERYTHING If there were a key drop system I feel like that would be better but otherwise its really fun game and I love it
Write a review for PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDSPlease describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to othersPlease remember to be polite and follow the Rules and GuidelinesThis game was the number one mostplayed game of 2017  because it simulated the misery of playing in unoptimised nonsensical garbage physics   mousetrackingsensitivity along with the Pan of Haephaestus NO pun intended
This game was fun some months ago Now to be honest I find it boring Many bugs are fixed and the performance of the servers is better now I now only play this game with my squad because we don t care about winning the game but because we have fun together  Overall I am disappointed
As a big fan of this game it really sickens me to write thisThe game has fallen off way to much it is sad to see the new rivals taking over the market and that is mainly due to the developers actually listening to the community We said countles times that we wanted region lock and better anti cheat but we never recieve we asked for better optimization game balance but still failed to deliverI hope that the developers of PUBG actually listen to us and terminate cross region gameplayThe Asian region has the biggest share of hackers and are populating EUNA regions not to mention the endless team kills and teaming in solo gamesWe dont wish the region ban only on asians but we wish that each region plays in its own without the ability for a region to play in anotherThis is a final call for PUBG I strongly think that these updates MUST be implemented as soon as possible
This used to be fun Now with the constant updates that brake other stuff in the process more than often server issues lag issues cheater issues if you want to just jump in and have fun with friends ill say thats all this game has to offer now
very intence gets the adrenaline rushing love this game and its really fun with a teamate
The bluehole is a great company who update bugs so much frequent that u have to update  many many times capacity than the game itself And they never think of some methods to forbiddeen add ons but the region where those cheated users from Good Job u LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Its good buy it
I d better play minecraft
If you want to get stupidly frustrated from the dsync lagg buggs or hackers and after all of this you somehow survive and kill someone just expect at the end the classic  Network lagg detected  that just kicks everyone out of game for no reason at all This if you can actually start the game through all the errors such as  Server is too busy   Bad module   Reconnecting I highly recommand you NOT TO BUY THIS BUGGY LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME
Broken game at releaseis bads game
There are some up and downs about the game but overall its a good FPSTPP shooter game 
WHO THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  WANTS EMOJ s WTF Fix the issues first then worry about the emojs cannot even control the hackers already running through the game Fast drop hacks No recoil hacks and other bs running aroundwould be a great game but like every other game made todate developers cannot keep on track fix the issues first then add LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for fruit cakes later Emojies come on
RnG and full of bugs
This game is a dissapointment with bad optimization and lots of hackers Stay away
always has problems with getting to online servers  saying there are too busy Yet I paid 30 dollars to not be able to play would not recommend getting until new company owns game
There is no sound when I start Pub G application on my PC when everything is working fine on my desktop and The game craches a lot It stops responding most of the time
Recently bought the game after the suggestion of a friend In my opinion a really good game which can a GOTY Only if it had good optimisationPros Gameplay is Awesome Game is addictive and super fun to play with your squadConsBad optimisationexpectingt a big update soon which fixes the optimisationanyways if you have a an entry level GPU like 1050ti you can run the game easily and enjoy  the gamerate 8510
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game
developer sucks  so far they can barely maintain their product  connections and crashing half of the time  i would kill myself if i was part of the group working on developing this game just knowing how often and repeatedly i fail to provide good service
It s a great game Would be better if they fixed the anti cheat system and worked on optimisation rather than useless emotes that I don t remember anyone asking forAlso                                     
Best game  pep hating LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  them haters 
will probably be good when the 4x4 map comes out
cara um jogo gostoso oleoso e mamavel muito bom gostoso enfiei
Love getting banned for doing nothing
BUGG   it s true title of this game
Great game butpoor optimized maybe if they fix it the game would get even better
A fun game that you can play with friends
Fun game and cool concept and believed that this game would be the start of something greatSadly the developers are a bunch of greedy losers who think it s more important to add microtransactions to the game because hundreds of millions of dollars isn t enough for them sort your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out
Why the entire game is based on camping in the houses  
tHE GAME IS A LOT OF FUN THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU CAN NOT PLAY HALF OF THE TIME BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THE SERVERS ARE FULL SO I STOP PLAYING IT
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Really Terrible after the update  Now it won t even start  couldn t get to the lobby just stuck to the splash spreen
At least 1 cheater every game server connection sucks
If you like pure liquid AIDS poured straight up your jap eye then buy this game right now
putting a decent level for another battle royal games but definately not good as it could be sure to be one the decade s finest games
BAN THOSE HACKERS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
TOO MANY HACKERS MOST OF THEM FROM CHINA LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Fun game super hard always chasing the zone move fast not trust bikes and kar98k is op
this game is absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dont buy it unless you have computer from 1998 and uganda internet and like 2 tick rate servers then you might hit your shots and get the loot up without having to pick it up 22 times worse game ive ever bought do not recommend
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game plagued by  real cheaters bugs crashs and ridiculous bansDon t use Warkeys  Warcraft III keybind editor or you may get banned Warkeys also has services running in the backgrounds to check for software updates so i d advise you to not even install it on the same computer you re playing PUBG with  can t know if I was banned because a WarKeys process was running during a game session or the update service was running
F U Hackers Plz Do Something
TRASH LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME
So many hackers
THIS IS A SOLID GAME The most intense game ive ever played

WE NEED MORE AUTISTIC ASIANS
Top LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game hackers low fpsbad graphics bad optimisiation dont waste your time with this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I regret bandwagoning on this onePurchased during EA and really enjoyed the concept and gameplay despite all the bugs and problemsI had hoped after the official release 100gig in updates and new  anti cheat system  It would be good to return to the game Sadly noCheaters still running rampantAssets and other graphics taking ages to load or not at allAdded microtransactions rather than reward their playersConnection problemsPerformance problemsOutdated engineThe game is hemorrhaging active players and attempts to lure players back are very weak and  unaappealingGreat idea and game concept but ended up a dissapointment
                                    Make American Servers Great Again
fortnite got a huge graphical update
Why fix problems when you can keep making money  Blueballs 2018
Absolutely worth the 30 the game costs I myself have put in over 300 hours into the game between the game and the test servers and I have never gotten bored at all There is a great depth of gunplay that makes the game easy to play but hard to master The only complaint that I have had is the size of the map being too big but that will soon change with the jungle map next month
that s a good game
The game is fun but unfortunately broken as hell When you are actually able to play the game do not experience any bugs and get equip the game is fun and if not for the technical problems I would definitely recommend it However at the current state the game does just not wortk properly and at the moment I am not even able to start the game
Is there any way I can write a review for this  It s a very fun game if you take out the hacking the desync and the bugs I have had more than a few games where I was killed by someone either across the map with the knowledge of where I am or someone who had no recoil I understand that every game is going to have hackers Also I don t believe this game deserves to be in the category  Full Release  The desync makes you fall down off of containers and rooftops the terrain damages your vehicle and the bugs happen too often to bring up specific example Fix your game guys
God Damn it FuXX hackerhoo I Like PUBG
Totally worth the priceIt s a fun game to play either alone or with friends and the game has become pretty stable when it comes to FPSIf you have friends who play this game don t hesitate and join them  
itz veri gud
The most optimized and ultra quality game
It s a fun game with well developed mechanics and realistic gameplay but is plagued with bugs Bugs in this game are very frustrating but don t let them take away from how rewarding the gameplay experience is  no other game can get your heart pounding while you have fun like pubg Also devs have been more active then ever this year and continue to regularly fix bugs and add features To the reviewers give it bad reviews due to a few bugs  Just because you re impatient doesn t mean that PUBG is a bad gameE  Got permabanned after a false positive with Battleye s cheat detection system PUBG appeal system was terrible and they didn t even review my claim  they just said that I got banned and I can t do LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about it So I m salty af still a good game but make sure that you don t have any programs that might tick of anti cheat software running in the background or in your dl folder  like any macro software even if it doesn t affect the game in any way because it ll LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you over just like it did me
Boring menu digging scavenger hunt
I like PUBGThe graphics are nice a good variety of guns and attachmentsIntense fights if you are in combatBut one thing PISSES ME OFFGETTING THE DESERT MAP 10 TIMES IN A ROWPlease you should be able to pick
I think that this game is a very great game and it has many aspects of it that make it better than some other battle royale games But while it has it s upsides it also has some downsides as well First of all it has way too many players cheating and it makes the game less fun But secondly people love the game so they get good at it I know many may disagree and I am fine with that but I think to give new players a better chance at winning I believe that they should add a match balancing system so that the good players don t just keep winning and the bad ones failing But while I can list a million more reasons why I don t like it I feel that it is unneccisary and the game is great no matter how many bad things there are about it I give it a 910
Random odds and ends aside amazing gunplay 910 would recommend
Fun game Bullcrap mechanics Is your car moving 3mph forward  Did you jump out because you had a full health bar  Well who cares you re still gonna die because somehow you ran yourself over with a vehicle
nayik
I wanted to like the game really did I most likely will continue to  give it a try  until I accept the fact I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  away my money on this  It s an unfinished game simply put it will never be finished the money has been made and there s few new customers to attract at this point  This is the product of  early access hype  an unfinished gamePros I love the ideaMatches start up quick and you jump right in if you die no big deal in 2 mins you ll be back inLooks pretty damn good visuallyWide array of weaponsarmorCons  Horrible hit detection    no by far the worst hit detection I ve seen ever  Players sometimes must lag a moving target rather than lead them with sights to get a hit reticle on scopes are pretty much for showUseless items  eg smoke grenade is client side onlyA number of hackerscheaters not nearly as bad as I had heardNo default account region   automatically is set to Asiatic on initial startup because it s alphabetical  LagPointless lootbox LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tSave your time and money this game is unfinished and will never be finished it will die before then and theyve already made millions upon millions of dollars on this and won t put out a finished product The idea they expanded to console before fixing bugs on PC pisses me off the most just another cash grab  Could ve been awesome but it s just another stale meme game
Cant choose yuour map and every thing in the gtame is broken play fortnite
China hackers and microtransactions for everything Do not buy this garbage

Nauseous Koreans kill teammates to destroy the game experience
Glitchy mess unoptimized theres nothing I can say that hasnt already been said
It s LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I so want to give this game a positive review because if it weren t for network lag issues it would be a blast it is unplayable however because it s CONSTANTLY lagging you can t run look around or do pretty much anything because of the lag if they ever fix this issue i ll be back but as of now it s time to uninstall and get a refund
Nope nope nope nope nope Nope NOpe NOPe NOPEGo ahead ask me if I recommendNOPE

This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Why i keep playing it 
just STOP
Should be better but it s fun Servers are frequently slow hit registration is jank and hackers never get dealt with Small EA style micro transactions are another thing that bring this game down Game has been out for awhile and it feels the same as it did when it was in alpha When this game is working like it should it s great but it doesn t more than it does lol
PUBG is amazing You can explore a different part of each map  there are two in every game The graphics are poorly optimized but very good as long as you have good hardware I would definitely recommend the is game and it has and will provide me with many hours of action packed entertainment
cant wait for final release on both PC and XBox
Its a decent game but it gets boring pretty quick and its still a bit of a mess
Lots of bugs bad optimization bad game
i like this game but ads pop up for me and its anoying
 Hackers are ruining the game People joining wrong region servers is annoying Some bugs still need to be fixedBut the game itself is amazing
Just doesnt feel right
I REALLY want to love this game But HACKERS are in almost every game To the point where it isnt fun no more and I feel like instead of fixing it they put their time and money into other places Emotes and new maps coming out of beta porting to console but they havent still fixed hackers    Its almost like they rather ban them and not fix the problem making them have to buy a new key So it makes them more profit At least thats what it feels like to me
DOES NOT WORK  STARTS  FOR 2 SECONDS AND CLOSE BUT DOESNT EVEN STARTS
Let me just start off by saying this game USED to be exciting As the first  Battle Royale  game I ever really came in contact with I had a great time playing All my buddies huddled around TV screen the suspensfulness of a top 5 scenario It was great Let me tell you that I have never hated a game more than how much I now hate PUBG If fortnite were first person I d switch in a heartbeat PUBG has become the glitchiest buggiest unfair hacker ridden POS game I have EVER played I am not just saying that because I just spent the better part of half an hour collecting gear weapons and meds fighting all the way to a top 10 just to have my bike flip over an obstacle that was LITERALLY NOT EVEN THERE If you re looking for a game that will make you want to pull out every one of your hairs one by one then look no further If youre looking for a game the dangles enticing game modes in front of your nose to have them glitch the F     out and disapear a few days later then look no further Most importantly If youre looking for a game who s developers only give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about making money and not give a single f     about the player or the players experience then look no further I m not some angry little kid writing a review I ve been playing this game since it first came out I ve been playing this game since it was just a mod for Day Z It s trash through and through
Fix the freakin crashes dang
I like turtles
Definitely best battle royale game at this momment I hope Brandon will make best shooter game at all during all updates
BR game kinda fun by yourself alot more fun with friends even more fun with your drunk with friends
f  king nonsense game its crashing all the f  king  please dont buy and save yourself hours and hours of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lag and rubberbandingf  k u in the bluehole
good game but still need a better server i think
Every update they make they some how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  everything up and half the people cant play I want my money back at this point dont buy it unless you want to play for a day and then not be able to play the next day
Sometimes its great most times its not The devs don t really seem to care too much about fixing existing problems or adding meaningful content On top of that everytime they fix one problem it creates two more The upside is that this game has so much potential and can be really good once the mechanics are tweaked and they add content thats not just more loot cratesBottom line is that until the devs get motivated to amp up their game consider playing something else  unless you dont mind suffering through the occasional crash or quirky mechanics for the chance at a good match
sever sucks
Worth playing Asia server and SEA server is slower than OCE server And I m living in SEA

Complete Garbage Max settings 80fps Get shot at 0 Fps freezes 2 seconds later comes back Don t forget about all the god damn cheaters They do nothing to fix the issues This is why other games are passing PUBG Im just fed up with it Lets port over to xbox too before the game is even fixed for PC
Playing this game makes me feel like I m being social 1010 would fool myself again
Player Unknown s Battleground is one of the games I really love in steam It really gives me excitement everytime I played it 100 player competing to earn that top 1 place is so addicting It is you against other 99 players Non stop action till you die or win Tho it really needs high powered computer to run smoothly but overall is amazing Giving all the luck to the creators that s all
game is too graphics demanding cant play with enough framerates even with gtx 950 thats too bad actually
Sold some items from H1Z1 bought this crappy game tested it for 50 minutes asked for a refund bought CS GO box keys didn t get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GG Bad optimization  very low fps with a 5ghz i5 8600k 16gb of 3200mhz ram R9 380 4gb Bad graphics  any 2009 Unreal Engine 3 game looks better than this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   UE4   game  Bad gun mechanics  a 300 sniper rifle is not a crossbow if you dont know how to make a good bullet physics system then at least try to copy from games like BF or ARMA Everything feels chunky
Devs clearly don t know what they re doing rolled out two patches since the game breaking one and still crashes on startup Support never got back to me 110
Such a badly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE en made game jesus christ these guys are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE en idiots and I honestly hope they fix it with over 20 million copies sold and it s still so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE en badly optimized it is fun as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  though
This game is only fun when my car hits a small hill and it stops and kills me
SAD PLAY MANY TIME N  KEEP DC HOW TO FIX IT ANY SUGGESTION PLS
CAN YOU TURN OFF THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING CAPLOCK WHEN NAMING THE GAME  
NOW these ching chong even hack on test serverI feel pitty for these losers                                    
Im going to start this review by saying im just going through all of my games and writing reviews and ill try to be as helpful as possible  Done of the best BR games at the moment this and fortnite have pretty much taken over my life at this point both are amazing games and this game is still being updated i just wish there was a way to pick what map you want because the desert map is good but its so constant its getting kind of stale i miss the old map and i rarely get it anymore make it kind of balanced please
If u want to play some battle royale than its the game for you
Good would be better without bugs and hackers
Game doesn t work I don t remember what I paid but it was too much Would not play
Optimisation for bluehole is like jews to hitler
Their  anti cheat  is so ineffective that it blocks more legit programs than it blocks cheats
stopped playing this game because of work and school for a couple months didnt even had enough time to log on steam until i finally log back in to find out that i get permanently banned for no reason contacted steam support and hawkinz and no solution 1010 would buy it again
this game is 10 out of 10 built my pc just so i could play
Good game but too many hackers
I don t know what people are on about Either you re good at the game or you suck and need to grind in a lot of hours before you become good This game focusses on realism which is why it s more unstable than Fortnite which is a little kids game Yes PUBG has bugs yes PUBG is more unstable but the game is being worked on and is a good game alreadyStop with your excuses of getting killed by a cheater cause the chances of that happening are very slim to none some people are just very good at the game  Watch Shroud on Twitch Also the better your computer the better you will be I play on a Laptop and that does definitely affect my performance But even though I play on a laptop I have already been in the top 4  of the world and currently after the update in top 40  and rising quicklyStop with your excuses play the game grind it and you will become good at it even if you only have a mid range laptop like I do
LOT OF BUGS LAGGS POOR GRAPHICS BUT STILL LOVE IT
The game still has some things that need fixing but its enjoyable even more if you are playing with friends
It s a fun game but too many bugsUI bugs can t click menu itemsControl bugs things randomly stop workingNo introduction or tutorial whatsoever for new players basically outsourcing all intro stuff to the publicpoor replay functionality no spectating
this game its amazing graphics its amazing everythin its amazing
I wish this waas more like fornite
the gunplay is not good  i feel like every gun bucks like a mule  takes half a clip or more to kill someone  overall very awkward feel to everything  feels like its not a polished game
One of my favorite shooters this far It have an amazing standardize combat system a wide varity of guns to find and take survival to a realistic level
 play game some chinese kid from across the globe cheats tell developer i don t want to play with chinese kid get called a xenophobe even tho 99  of cheaters is from China don t even start about ping i should work on my xenophobia i guess 110

PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS for me is a love hate relationship There are times where this game horrible optimization and game stability frustrates the hell at me and turns me away from playing it But with the recent March 2018 content update I must say optimization has been greatly improved People are always comparing this game to the recently released battle royal game Fortnite Now as a player who has tons of hours on both games my favorite is still PUBG To be fair Fortnite has a way better development team who listens to their player base and releases constant updates every week for there players to enjoy PUBG on the other hand releases updates less frequently but when they do come out they add a lot of great content Now lets talk about the gameplay  Now this might be quite opinionated depending on your experience and with that being said to me personally I love the gameplay Gun play feels smooth interacting with your inventory is great driving with the recent update is greatly improved Like holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  its been way improved Before the latest March 2018 content update driving felt horrible Car handling was garbage Now regarding the two maps that are currently in the game Erangel and Miramar They both have completely different play styles with one having lots of mountainous terrain and the other being repetitively flat My personal favorite map is the desert map Miramar because of the large open landscape and tons of huge cities to explore  But some negatives with this large open map is the difficulty to find enemies Depending are where you drop it can take to the top 20 to 30 to start seeing people which might be a negative to some Erangel on the other hand you will might find yourself in tons of more gunfights and struggling to find decent loot Unless you drop it on the popular locations With all this being said I love PUBG and will continue playing it almost every day For 30 there is a lot of content here We just got a cool new emote system steam achievement and a new jungle map releasing on the test server towards the end of the month My rating for PUBG at its current state a 910 and cant wait for the new content to release
the game is gettting better just now if they can get rid of the cheaters
Slow paced and strategic gameplay Dont expect to win a game without thinking first Takes skill Although I ve become bored of the game now I still recommend this Squads is really difficult although this game can be amazing to play with friends
please make  own server for china it will be the best solution for all the player in the world sorry i am not racist but this can not be tolerated anymore 80  cheaters who play come from china itt is fact imaginewhenyou play with the spirit and die in the kill by fuc  g cheater and it happens every day even cheaters are now getting smarter they only use cheat to see through the wall and play as a professional player please dude im love so much this game just cr8 china Own server trust me
very laggy game unplayableit is actually kinda  pay to win  game because if you have better pc specs and better ping you have advantage than other playersnot fair game
This game made me crazy about  Friendly Kill  you playing game for a almost match and your team mate kill you Why what happend  Plz lock all account KILL TEAM MATE
An expensive horse LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that will break in every patch Graphics are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Bush from long distance looks like a player Stupid movement and animations Impossible to play Solo due to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  from all over the world mostly russians that will kill you because  fun  With the money they have this game still feels like its only been out a week or so An absolute garbage Consider playing tetris More fun than this piece of crap
Good game but developers could fix some bugs and stuff And that new emote thing was bad idea
a problem needs 2 think about more than 10 days   bad work efficiency
The devs make no effort to improve gameplay or optimize the game More bugs than viridian forest Often times you can t even play the game because it says servers too busy and after like 20 restarts it works Still no idea why that happens Still no option to play custom games to get a feel for shooting different weapons to test recoil Always trying to get more money out of you by giving you crates that require keys to open Took them over a year to fix simple bugs that ruin gameplay such as getting stuck while parachtuing teleporting randomly to another location on the map and vehicles flipping or getting sent flying for no reason As I was writing this review ran into another bug that says Wrong MatchState pre login InProgress and didnt let me in the game There is a reason this game is dying
This game had potential but each day the hacking problems get worseThe devs are wasting time adding stupid emotes instead of spending ALL of their efforts on trying to fix the hacking epidemic that has taken over their gameNAOCEU servers are overflowing with Chinese players who are ruining the game for everyoneDo not buy
The concept behind the game keeps you coming to play it everytime Best game after GTA V
    _  
Game is full of cheaters and it s just getting worse  If you haven t bought it yet then don t bother

Buttcheek destroying action occasionally if you get past the hackers and no life s I guess it s decent
Great game That being said it is buggy as hell full of cheaters and developers dont know how to roll out an update Downloaded an update to roll back anti cheat policies and now the servers are all down Figure it out guys
Its no wonder fortnite has been taking over the genre It just shows that the market has no time for any slip up no matter how big you arewere Please                                    
HAckers everywhere first game already see hacker who shoot floor and get a headshit open channel flooded with mic spam china alien language
Very gey
still waiting for bigger performance upgrade  
I CANNOT RUN SO YEAH   
The junk game is not yet excellent and there are people to play i just want to say garbage garbage garbage
What an utter shame This game could have been made into something amazing something fantastic But when greed sets in and the developers just focus on money  multiple types of keys locked crates that force you to buy keys all the fun and joy the game once possessed is now just gone Don t buy this game too many bugs too many hackers poor optimisation and no fun
would rather shove a needle down my japs eye whilst getting ravaged by the pope from behind than play this game again
Nice game all around but unless you have top end graphics you wont see anything or anyone therefore dieing very quickly
Very good Concept  Battle Royale surprised this wasn t done soonerPoorly realized game though with chunky unintuitive controls and an overall  beta  feel  Maybe we ll get a proper BR soon
Only land at School Pecado and Swamp Temple
i love this game and i played pubg almost 200hrs and i didnt tryed the awm i treid avery thing
This game is pretty fetchin lit
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I used to love PUBG Until all the chinese hackers came in Theyre EVERYWHERE Not one single normal game can be played I used to be a hardcore fanboy and ive had to move to fortnite  which i used to hate btw because of all the hackers Seriously go play something else Or waste your money and see all the hackers everywhere Until this game is fixed and china is region locked i will not play this game and it will suffer for it  Not to mention the incredibly bad FPS drops buildings not loading and crashing every other game PUBG is a piece of garbage I can run arma 3 max graphics better than i can run this game on low Developers only care about MONEY Thats it all about the  with them DO NOT BUY THIS GAME   RegionLockChina
Nope
This game is one of the most bugged games I ve played the game moves jerky the developers are trash design is garbage unoptimized game  although the game is released the cars in the game can fly when touch them the loading of the texture is slow the graph of the game is one of the worst the fps drop dramatically the letters disappear in the menu sometimes stuck in the menu and you can not enter the game plus many other problems i have almost 700 hours and i see what game is this at first it seems a great game but with so many bugs neoptimization disappointed me
I have to review this for a community quest
updates are always trash
player unknown bg is a game that brings together the best of humanity
Pubg a bland game and tense moments I m not very good but not terrible I just find this game boring and makes me on my toes I paid 30 dollars for this unbaked game even though it  released  Not to mention that the glitchy and stuttering mess even on my decent if not good setup This game is ok Decent I just find this genre over hyped and don t particularly care if it crashes and burns I ll come back when it gets interesting In the meanwhile im sticking with CS GO  This review is not directed at pubg in particular but to most battle royal games Have a good day everyone
Got killed by a naked man using the S12K with a 15x scope called my mom gay
PlayerUnknowns  Loading Simulator 2k18
great just need to be better optimza
what a joke of a game wait 30 mins to loot just to have a guy come behind you and kill you which you couldnt hear even on your turtle beaches when you engage with an enemy game lags really blue balls    what a complete joke of a game and a waste of time
If you want a honest review wait to buy the game Don t waste your money yet till Bluehole decides they want to fix serverconnection issues and lag This game has been out for far to long to be still in a terrible state and it feels like they re going backwards at this point Not recommended if your big on connection or lag or frames for that matter Recommend if you like a strategic type of gameplay Just not in a good state and needs major improvements
When I can actually run the game without it crashing mid game I ll change my review But for now stay away from this game
Region lock china  no hackers
This game will be really good after like 3 major updates
Roblox is much tighter than this
ssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I myself love this game don t get me wrong but when the developers can t even bother to fix sliding bugs that instantly kill you or manage to get a game such as this servers with more than 20 ticks i can not possibly say to someone oh this game is great go get it and enjoy the full experience
cheter
eba
I like this game a lot It s pretty much a crazy stupid experience that reminds me of  1 Spooky Dooky tense games  CSGO R6S and 2 silly games that last 2 hours  gang beasts bigfoot duck game The reason PUBG rises above both of those categories is that it isn t just a competitive shooter in that it offers so much more and that the magical fun with friends dynamic doesn t wear off You can either work on your flick tap pro kill compilation stuff by playing solo first person or ram your friends with a hippie van in squad third person There are some bugs though And some hackers and whatever and some lag issues but that s a small price to payFinal Rating  810
hackers galore
Even tho the game has realistic weapons but it does have a whole lot of bugsIm not even mentioning awful optimisation   my gaming laptop is able to run battlefield 1 high settings with 50 fps same is with many other new games such as thw witcher 3 but pubg cant run more than 12 fps on medium 23 on minimal so i have to play at min settings on lower resolutionThe biggest problem are hackers I am shure that in all games combined there are less hackers  than in pubgIf in counter strike valve is doing something  in fact a lot pubg has the polotics of  we will ban them so that they could buy it again  So pease be aware of all these problems FOR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  SAKE DOWNLOAD FORTNITE FOR FREE
Please help me I can t start game after update
This game was fun when it first came out As time went on this game has become utter LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  It is a walking simulator Make the maps smaller I go 20 minutes only to be killed by some guy named Gunner who hides in the corner and kills me and he acts like he s a OG Gangsta deciple from the heavonsNo wonder Fornite is wrecking dat LOVE LOVE LOVE PS  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you devs
so much hype for a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
Questionably better fire than CoD WWII fire 610
The current reviews aren t doing the game justice It has its minor glitchy problems but overall one of the best games I ve played It can be frusturating but it s also a hell of a lot better than Fortnite  in just about every way
Top Game
I WANT THIS GAME TO LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING DIE FIX THE SHOTGUNS PLEASE
Too many microtransactions and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a game I already play for At least Fortnite is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing free
Ok gaim
Great time killer to wrap a night of gaming with buddies across the country That s about it Win some lose some see some cheaters from time to time but in the end just a good way to burn a couple hours with the homies
not worth the money Match disconnected everytime bby saying battleeye courpted and boom your kills are wasted
Should have seen this one coming when I broke my common rule of not buying games that are in Early Access This game is a complete joke at this point I don t regret buying the game when it was new and interesting  I regret that my money helped cement in the devs  minds that they can let their game go to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and still make a profit You may as well be spending your money on a game like Goat Sim if you want a game as buggy and unfinished as this In Goat Sim that was intentional but here it s just lazy All you ll find here is unreliable mechanics mixed with grabage optimization and a team of devs who realized a long time ago that they dont have to actually improve the game for it to do well This game just feels like and emptier buggier version of any other Battle Royale on the market It s a shame this BR game came out before the others because the unique appeal of the game when it was first available actually made the game sell well Now that every other verison of this kind of game feels just about finished you re left with what is pretty much DayZ  Battle Royale Saying this game isn t early access is the worst part of the whole game Just admit your game isn t ready yet and work to improve it instead of rushing it out as a  finished game  and never adding neccessary changes again What happened to PUBG is an example of why you should wait to buy any new popular game The success can often cause the game improvement to stagnate and then all the copy cat games end up being 10x better in the end The only reason this game has any playtime on my account anymore is that I continue to let other people play the game on my account Personally I ve drifted away to other games and the shiny new toy that once was the Battle Royale Genre is now a smoldering pile of garabageJust stop giving these people money Please I no longer care about PUBG or its development but I really do hope this review can help someone save 30 dollars So what else could you spend that 30 on  Here s just a few suggestions If you re a fan of large world exploration games that aren t linear and have some challenge behind hack n  slash mechanics look into  Hyper Light Drifter  It s a really great game and it s soundtrack is just wonderfulDid you enjoy Super Mario 64 Banjo Kazooie Psychonauts and other 3D open world platformers of the sort   A Hat in Time  is a great modern game that fits right into that category It s also got a great soundtrack as well as fun and polished mechanics that envoke the best parts of classic platformers There s some really passion behind the game  Celeste  was a pretty big game for a while and if you enjoy 2D platformers of any kind you ll likely enjoy it It never feels too hard or too easy and there are plenty of ways to get through the game no matter how skilled you are If you enjoy simple mechanics but difficult games  Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy  is a great Your first time playing through the game will take many hours and will challenge you a lot but once you play through the game you want to go again I ve fully beaten the game 109 times and now take roughly 5 minutes to play all the way through For just 8 dollars this game provides plenty of entertainment  And to end all this  Yeah Fortnite has cartoony graphics and minecraft style building but at least it s free runs well is fast paced and ACTUALLY WORKS most of the time It s basically everything this game lacks If you are really so turned off by the visuals and typically younger community of Fortnite that you won t even try it I don t see why you d settle for a game in its Alpha build that claims to be a finished product I think Fortnite is objectively a better experience than PUBG and I m not even a huge fan of their game in the first placeNot gonna proofread this I just had to get the salt outEnd Pointless Rant
i like this game but at the same time i hate this game also the loot system is the worst i have ever seen its so frustrating and  freaking annoying so yeah thats why a thumbs down
Only played for a little bit but is pretty enjoyable Although it is pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing boring on your own and would reccommend duos or squads
Cheap made H1Z1 copy made for kids in special education class Broken beyond repair ressource hungry piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Not worth buying unless you re a r tard Fortnite seems to be the better option if it wasn t for the cartoonish game optics and minecraft game mechanics Game is full with hackers from china which is of course number 1 Sold at day one in early access for full retail price that s how hard you get fugged in the bum by the developersMy advice  Don t buy it or wait until the developers get it fixed which is of course never
PubG Crashes on startup so mom gay hoo haha
How this game works 1 Walk for 20 minutes2 Get sniped out of nowhere3 Repeat
It seems like a good game at first but as you get to play more you ll discover a lot of bugs not funny but game breaking bugs that will ruin your day or cheatersBugs  firstly when you hit someone on your screen and then die to him on the death cam you ll see that YOU DIDN T EVEN SHOOT Fun amirite Let s not forget when you get into cover but die because of the lag because on his screen you re still standing still thereDevs want to make the impression that they re active involved but only working on the exterior look of the game not on the broken mechanics and systems  1
So much money into blueballs pocket and they cant fix the issues since early access release
This game was fun But all the chinese in the NA server makes it way less fun You cannot communicate with team mates if you random into a team And you die half the time to hackers Apparently from forums I read most of the hackers are coming from the Chinese servers So I m not playing this game anymore because of this huge issue Its turned into a chinese game Which is fine But it alienates a lot of people who just want to play an enjoyable game I do not reccomend this game anymore
Don t waste your money I bought one copy to try with the intention of getting 3 more for the kids The amount of cheating on the PC is incredible Over and over you run around collect only to have your entire squad wiped from the other side of the map by someone with a pistol doing headshots The reporting system does nothing and every round there always one I ll save the other 90 thanks but no thanks
Bad performance and quite slow gameplay Long waiting between games and all together very unpolishedFortniteis by far better and free
This game is a heap of garbage at 450 hours played I have decided its time to quit this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  In every single server there is nothing but Chinese todlers and degenerates screaming their head off that  China is number one  The developers are only cashing out on keys for their loot crates and could really care less about an unplayable game because the chinese just keep developing cheats
Totally not worth the money Server crashes now and then money orientated developed Bad overall Experience
This game is great Realistic gunfights and great detail is what I think highlights the game Totally worth 30 and highly recommend this game
410Full of cheaters and poor serverIf they fix thisIt will be 10
One of the most addictive games i ve ever played
Nice looting simulator
I don t think this is a good gameThere are still hackers in the game and the game is really poorly optimized I have a GTX 1060 and the game is barely playable at 60 fps on the lowest settings  1440p while looking like a game from 2005 Even at Ultra the game looks like complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and there is no excuse for this poor performance since other developers managed to develop games that look much better and also run a lot smoother than this gameThe devs haven t done anything since the game launched in early access Hackers from China crossmap one shot you the gameplay is clunky and first person mode feels terrible beause of the bad Fov It is still the same piece of trash game as before I used to really enjoy this game when it wasn t hyped yet
This game is absolutly amazing the graphics and FPS are nice the concept and things to do are amazing I like the variety of maps and guns the amount of customization on your avatar are incredible Overall this game is probably the best game Ive ever played regarding the price Everything in this game is worth the price I payed and I am very satisfied with my purchase on PUBG
RECOMMEND  MAYBEif you can get the game to work and if your lucky enough to not have massive frame drops and if your lucky enough not to play with hackers in the game and if your lucky enough to have an overpowered rig where the poor optimization wont really matterTHEN ITS A GREAT GAME
the nuw updat suck 10 7  i cant open the game  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  
this game is fun always
1010 Better than fortnite LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fortnite and anyone who plays that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   
Stupidly minus the nerves and cigarette smoking after taking the top 1
had some fun with pubg but i would recommend just skipping it and go directly to the real thing  escape from tarkov
The best experience I had with this game was when I uninstalled it And that failedJokes aside  even though it actually failed to uninstall if I can t run this thing at 30fps 1080p without massive stuttering and lowering resolution to 720p on a system which can run BF1 at its highest 1080p settings  144fps it s not worth the headache SorryEdit  I decided to add 16 gigs of 3200mhz ram on my new toaster While it seems to have reduced stuttering the ideal setting was to have that and create a 16 gig paging file cache on another SSD for it as it seems to eat ram like Star Citizen or something Even then stuttering was still  although not as frequently observedOverall it needs a lot more love from the devs
Best Game I ever rplayed
wow recent update bans VMWare as a  cheat  program and constantly kicks me out of gamewith my day to day use of VMWare as a dev station I have to abandon PUBG instead of VMWarethis is really a crappy fix that annoys players rather than preventing hacks hackers still appear in almost every game apparently the dev stops thinking and finally decide to put an end to this game anyway players already paid right I d say this game has rubbish class hack prevention and weird dev thought to constantly insult and annoys playersIt used to give me some fun but I would not recommend anyone to have this game at this time just try other alternative PUBGs from other devs with  better skills and clearer heads
One of the worst games I ve ever played U loot so much good essentials and die instantly The wall hug peek is cheating in third person view This game will make u scared
Its very enjoyable to play with friends
Best game ive ever played
Go to final circle be killed be  a chinese hacker once every 5 games
Good Game but there is some cheaters and bugs that need to be fixed
regionlockchina this is impossible with hackers no fun at all
just fix the damn game spent a lot of many for this shameonyou
fortnite is better now
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE est servers possible stupid non sense playing with chinese everything is lagged tick rate are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server quality LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE graphics sucks the game is not optimized its not a full product and i won t suggest anyone to buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  waste of time gave this game so many chances its still suck balls its not ready yet its shouldn t be sold and the loot boxes is a total crap 310   Overall
best game ever and i want to make this to have sale
very good and addictive
Game is broken
Great GAME
Fun game Great game when you find good lootTerrible game if all you find is a pistol
THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO DIE
We need to build a firewall and make China pay for it all China s not sending their best folks They are sending cheaters people who don t english and bad players Some I assume are good people
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE too much time on this computergame
 gets shot from Stalber while at Ruins OhLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Reports 
Well this is the third update in a row guys and it s bring s you nothing but a bunch of useless clothes for your carachter There are more useless updates and there are less really important changes and fixes to the game that need to be worked on A LOT MORE than the developers work on it nowSomwhere in Blue Hole Studios  Do we have to work on the game mechanics new maps new modes and enlargen tha game itself  Nah just release a couple of new glasses and hats and make players pay for that
The most unstable game and servers everStarted with so hype but now PUBG is doomed to die the bugs are so many both game and network bugs that i believe they are not manageable anymore
I love it you should get it you wont regret  D
Lets add emotes when our base game still sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE  I d be LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ashamed to be a developer of this game
LMAO the devs sue anyone who remotely copies their mechanics
I have an MSI   Dominator G with a Nvidia GTX 970M A month ago this game ran beautifully on high settings with a stable 90 fps unless I was in the pregame lobby Just tried to play a game and now even on the lowest settings with everything turned to low or off I have 15 fps no matter what s happening on screen PUBG Corp cmon how do you mess up optimization this badly  This is what Early Access is for If you still have good optimization ingame enjoy it PUBG is fun when it runs fine However I would recommend avoiding this game until they fix alot of the issues
v gud
MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME1Too many bugs2hackers3dissapointing graphics for a 2017 18 game 4stupid vehicle physics and bugs 5the fact that its a 30euro game and have all of this problems 6boringcuz it doesnt have other gamemodes or just something else to doand i think that PUBG is a game that you will like in the first 2 3 months and then will understand all this things i just said
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing so delay  fix this 1
Why do I match all Chinese r u LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing kidding me  I need to speak English players I dont know why it will become like this And I hope u can be based on nationality to distribute players  If you cant match the English player I will be very distressed I just bought this game on such a time the official is asleep yet  Why all North American servers are Chinese      I need your improvement
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  rubbish game
                                            
the best game in first day i play 7 hours
Great game Just needs some quick fixes but I m addicted to it
I used to love this game absolutley love it Now these days I regret ever turning it on The amount of hackers has just gotten ridiculous I m not meaning that the other people were just better players I mean having auto target on no recoil what so ever having dots on the map showing where everyone is shooting people through wallsover mountains or on the other side of the maps with no scopes on the gun meaning there was no way they could have ever seen the people Some people have gone as fair as not letting you even watch the deathcam cause they know they are hacking 30 hackers 30 god damn hackers in less then 2 day I have reported Do you know how utterly disapointing it is to turn on a game that you know there is no chance you ll ever win cause of hackers  To the people who are saying we are racist for wanting to region lock China then I guess we are freaking racist for want to play a game the proper way and actually enjoying a fair go at it
I was convinced by a friend to get pubg and have to admit that im having a world of fun Getting use to the controls and aiming at a distance is challenging but still i cant stop playing On the other hand Ive been getting the prompt  servers are to busy please try again later  which has now reached the level of being rediculous Ive sat for 30min trying to connect how much later should I then try   
GG bluhole
While I recommend this game let me make this clear  I am not happy with the game in its current state  While I love the rush that this game gives you and the realism present the game is not easy to play  Dying behind cover happens all to often due to client side hit registration which is infuriating and the fact the game is unoptimized and bugs run rampant is also a huge let down  And the locked crates   People criticize EA for the Battlefront II crates and heroes but this game makes you pay 250 for a key to open a SINGLE crate containing a SINGLE item  All in all features that would make this game much more enjoyable are  The addition of content more freqeuntly IP Bans for cheaters with multiple offenses Optimization Server side hit registration More  game changing  content  Most of the content recently added has been exclusively cosmetic More frequent updates Dedicated ServersPUBG is a 30 game that has a lot of potential but Bluehole has dropped the ball  With all the money they have already made off of this game they should easily be able to hire more staff and give their game dedicated servers  Right now though they re greedily sitting on they re profits doing next to nothing to further the development of a could be great game
cant play the game half the time cuz the servers are too busy what bs i want my money back
pretty fun i guess you lowkey rage when you die tho
Luv it
Bruh the hit boxes r ok but need wrk
A lot of simple things work against the core idea of this game  the AA leaves a lot to be desired Everything is a softened blob or an over jagged lines  The color pallet has no separation Lack of saturation and contrast is poor but is slowly being fixed by the addition of more colorful clothing in loot boxes  patch 10 fixed a lot of lighting issues but it still has a lot to do in the way of more dynamic shadows and highlightsThe combination of all these things makes spotting people frustrating People should be rewarded for finding good hiding spots or spotting people far off who are running around like idiots This should be a part of the gameplay that is not hindered by its poor utilization of the game engineOther instances of server desync lag spikes and model glitching completely undermine the actually fairy good gunplay Bullets go where you aim and guns have great feel and sound but none of that matters because it has worse desync than counter strike 16 but at least in counter strike its always there and you can adapt to it in PUBG it can happen at random and you re left wonder what the actual hell happenedGreat idea decent execution rushed to launch slow at fixing problems that shouldnt have left betaIf you love the elements of sneaking around and listening to people play Rainbow Six Siege insteadIf you love the squad based tactics on a large scale map and taking an area together play Battlefield 4 If you love meme worthy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t also play Siegeor battlefield
worst unoptimized piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ive ever played
Really nice game and fun to play
7 of 10 times you die to cheaters LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
Its a great game  and really fun with friends
Lotta fun times but the game is clunky full of cheaters and genuinely slow paced unless you hot drop I ll play it with friends but doubt I ll keep consistent at it Too many other amazing FPS and Fortnitewell yea exactly Blueballs doesn t stand a chance
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in unbelieveblecrashed me right in first fight 3 times in a rowHOW  WHY ONLY ON FIGHTS __
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lag all the way Nonstop lag Crash etc LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game FIX YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAMEThe game is really cool amazing and fun expect these crashes lags not rendering
The game is an incredible experience in itself The only thing disheartening to very many players is the amout of users able to use 3rd party software  AutoAimAnd because of this the incredible becomes mediocre and rife with disappointment
Mistakenly seal my number I bought it and asked to lift the ban I just played for an hour How do you cheat  The request to release the seal I think VAC should reflect on my anti cheating system
Bug G
Awesome FPS Great when stable bad when servers too busy
I don t recommend this for PC Xbox though it runs like turd  but a recent update has improved performance slightly is a lot more enjoyable because  1 no cheaters 2 most Xbox owners are English speakingfrom the US 3 everyone is on an even playing field due to controller and console hardwareIf you re reading this and you re thinking  hah console what a joke  then I don t blame you But from my experience from playing PUBG on PC vs Xbox I have more fun on the Xbox despite the numberous amount of issues it has and how far behind it is on updates compared to the PC versionIf you own an Xbox One go for it But I don t recommend this game for PC at its current state
Uninstalled this game as it ran like absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE  re installed after the new updates and optimization  mapsEvery single game I ve played so far has ended with someone from China just speed hacking through the entire map and headshotting everybody010 play a different game until China gets region locked
This game is stale The devs never listen to the players They only update the asthetics over the actual game Dont buy thisEspecially when Fortnite is free
this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Bluecunts have not optimised the game at all no one gives a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about adding new features or even shot damage or blue circle damage until you optimised the game and fixed the bugs hackers and vehicle LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t
Crashes often in the middle of games in clutch situations Update listed for zero bytes never began update Crashed whilst playing when update was queued
PROS This game is EXTREMELY FUN to play  There is a learning curve if you re new to the game  but that s to be expected  The game will get your adrenaline flowing and definately appeals to competitive type people CONS Hackers are RUINING the game experience  It is very frustrating to make it to near the end of the game only to be shot dead by four or five hits with no missesthen you go watch your death cam and the person who killed you used a 4x scope with an M4  Their aim snaps to you and there is zero recoil even while they re aiming down the scopeAt this time  I do not reccommend the game to friends because the cheating is so very frustrating  If the hackingcheating is stopped  then I would highly reccommend the game
this game is fun but is broken as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  510
I bought this game quite early and i must say its been quite a ride i rarely ever drop a review and if i do its normally not anywhere near this detail if your considering buying this game here are some of the pro s and con s i find most important in this gamePro  The game constantly manage to bring new scenarios be it the gunbattles you have or the lootgame you runCon  Poor client side hit detection or  CSHD  you might experience getting shot through a wall or someone exploiding CSHD because pubg is still in an early phase  https wwwredditcomrPUBATTLEGROUNDScomments69h6sxclient_side_hit_boxes_ruining_the_game  Disclaimer Cheaters have also posted on above link The link is only to prove my point of CSHD not promoteing cheating in any way Pro  The game has a very unique balance between realism and fantasy Even tho no man would stand after 6 bullets from an AR no matter how much bandage or how many syringes he s got however the aiming strategic camouflage travel speed and distance all makes it far from most FPS games like battlefield Call of duty or even games like RustCon  Even tho the realism is great the stability of the servers limits the ability to spawn grass and some bushes at larger distance  500m less for grass makeing it mostly useless to use open fields or tall grass to hide in unless in a small circle Pro  Most of the game is based on RNG  Random Number  or item Generation this is allows for the scenarios described in first  Pro Con  The RNG can seem unfair at times a lot of the game is based on luck makeing this game not as skill based as Counterstrike or League of Legends thereby also makeing it  Esports unfriendly Pro  The game features both 3 rd and first person gameplay which both are almost uniqe experiences and diffrent playstylesCon  PUBG still doesnt allow you to choose what maps you prefer to play in my personal experience 3 rd person gameplay on  Woods  map is kinda fun as the terrain disallows you from exploiding the camera for very long distances However the  Desert  map becomes nothing but a camper infestation in third person On the other hand the desert map is very enjoyable in first person as you get to have medium to long range gunbattles more regulary contrary to the  Woods  map where things in first person can seem slightly annoying if the circle ends in tall grass and you end up proneing your way arround for serveral minutes Also the amount of terrain on the  Woods  map in first person can become a bit of a nursance in my opinionOverall i would certainly recommend the game even with its current limits and flaws this game is still young and constantly improveing
Literally the best Battle Royale game on steam If you can find one please tell meFortnite is not on steam And is also not as good as this game by a long shot
This game is full of hackers and they can ban you for no reason
it ok
CS ye elvedaa
1110 laggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  gameplay  If you don t speak chinese expect to be team killed by someone yelling fuack yo muddar  If you like games made in 2010 you will definitely love this new 2018 fps
fix your game jesus christ is this gonna be another dayz standalone that sits in early access for 4 years  Thats really what it feels like it seems to be getting worse theres really no  better  other than the driving is moderatly fixed other than the bikes it has to many errors with windows that need to be fixed to people  can at least open the gamefun once it opens until you die from someone with no line of site on you or locks on you before you come around a corner so yah overall just wait untill they put this trash on sale if you are trying to play with friends if you are just trying to get a new game to play im SURE you can find something betteralso                                        
I regret every second of my 35 hours in this game It s absolute garbage and it makes me angry knowing that all they re doing is pulling out new items instead of fixing this pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE INB4 GIT GUD
I have enjoyed my time playing this game despite all of its blatant issues Something about this game keeps me coming back This is easily going to be my most played game on steam probably ever
This is a very fun game  
If u think u gonna chill out in this game alone plz dont buy it because u cantIf u think u gonna chill out in this game with friends plz dont buy it because there are more funny games that u guys will enjoyIf u think u gonna become a pro player and become like top player of this gameI suppose u are a hacker cause only hackers win this game 010 untill they put more effort on repairing this piece of sh t anyway 1mP05Si61E
Region lock Asia TOO MANY HACKERS
My review can be summed up in my most recent match My squad dropped fairly close to the power plant Our first casualty was a guy who landed on a building wrong and fell through the map The remaining two teammates began looting when an altercation broke out I couldn t make out what the group of Chinese man was saying but it seems as if the squeaker of our group picked up a Kar 98 that wasn t rightfully his As I moved in for a closer look shots rang out from their building It was only a warning but the Chinese man had made it clear that he was leaving that house with a Kar one way or another Before the squeaker had a chance to make it to the motorcycle the China man downed him with a shotgun Fearful of the same fate I dropped my SKS in a bush outside the home and was sporting nothing but a helmet and a crowbar when I entered the home The Chinese man dropped several useless items at my feet next to the squeaker s body before we departed the area in search of more loot Shortly after looting several small buildings we came across a group about 400 meters ahead of us We played it safe and stayed back waiting for the perfect time to strike After stalking the team for several miles we decided to make our move I stayed low to some bushes outside the team s stronghold and waited for them to exit the house When I turned to make sure my teammate was also in position I realized he had stolen our motorcycle and was quickly eliminated in a barrage of gunfire coming from a group behind us that we didnt see I quickly went prone and found myself in a heated battle between the group in the house and our surprise guests When the smoke cleared the victors exited the area as the zone had moved another 10 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing miles across the map I popped out of the bush and made a run for it through a wheat field in a safer direction As I approached the blue wall of death I was overwhelmed with happiness that my health had only depleted by half I was maxed out on level three gear and a suppressed M4 decked out with the best attachments 7 painkillers and a few medkits I was in the top 15 with great position for the next zone After several bandages I heard a faint honking sound in the distance Before I knew it a UAZ who had used the hill behind me as a motorcross jump had landed in front of me As I stood there in awe a naked man with an Uzi jumped up from a bush and killed me with little effort looted my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and won the game 1010
BEST GAME EVER 
PlayerUnknown s Battlergrounds is one of my all time favorite battle royal I feel as if the developers have put some good time into it even if it still bugged and glitched or just plane out annoying  REGIONLOCK CHINA Many are hating on the game and how the devs aren t putting in enough effort but I would want to ask them have you even made a game before  And if so has it become as popluar as PUBG which many play and would criticize the devs for not keeping up  Well I certaintly haven t so that is why I keep these ideas to myself since it wont get me anywhere I believe that we should as relax and play the game how it s meant to be played Finally I want to add good luck devs and I hope the new map will be awesome
This is a great game Don t let the negitive comments stop you from buying this game 8  10
Playing PUBG actively is like being in a long term abusive relationship At first it s great it s the best relationship you ve ever been in everything is new and fresh you are discovering things about yourself you never knew existed and you re having a lot of fun Then the relationship starts to go sour certain things are starting to bug you about your partner they do things that are pretty out of line and certain things about them you start to not like However you ignore these faults and stay in the relationship because it was great at one point and you are still genuinely enjoying it You stay longer in the relationship for a couple more months or even years then it hits you you realise your partner is a really bad person and is not a good match for you You wanna break up with them but they won t let you leave they start beating you You ask them to change their flaws they ignore you and sometimes even flat out tell you  You re wrong  even though you and everyone you know thinks they need to change It gets worse and worse and the beatings get more and more severe until Every game you play features issues due to bad servers a poorly optimised game and a metric f  k tonne of Chinese hackers So you ultimately uninstall
Very good game although the physics of this game needs some work Overall VERY FUN AND INTENSE GAME
                                     Good game  Hackers  PUBG
I bought game nearly as soon as I had the money back during the start of Early Access After having a ton of meme tastic times with game crashesfloating enemiesDune Buggies flipping over a slight crack in the road I went and made sure I had others that could join me in the memes and bought them the game Between Early Access and the first 3 months of  Launch  if you could calling launching an 85  bug filled game launching this was just about the only game that could pull me away from my other mainstays like CSGO WoW and League It helped that I am actually pretty good at First and Third person shooters usually allowing me to get out of the first 10 mins of hell that is a PUBG game So the first 400 450 hours of the game delightfully fun even with dealing with the occasional hacker  occasional in my experience Eventually with the rise of initial popularity of Fortnite BR  Cause its not the original game type I decided to try it just to see what other BRs were out there To this day I prefer PUBG style and design to Fortnite but the pile of garbage that is this game ranging from the lack of nearly any proper hit detection to a guy shredding you from 150m away with an Uzi through a fresh level 3 vest and helm from a drop makes this game just downright cancer to playI should know what a cancer game is I play CSGO without ESEA Overall DONT BUY THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Until they start making major strides in a lot of the current issues people are having with the game this game will continue to bleed players to other BRs like Fortnite
Rampant hackers  1Teamkillers that don t get any reprucussionslack of report button in event  1Foreign players doing the above   1Tons of bugs  1Crappy servers  1Terrible microtransactions  1Favoritism  1Total score  8 Things that make every game suckPS Steam s Featured and Recommended section sucks btw Bring back the old front page
I heaviliy recoomnd this game I had a great time with it and still continue too
Been playing this game since launch without too many issues Today I got banned for owning VMware as they have just decided that this is a  disallowed program  Loads of people in the same boat on the official PUBG forums So yeah if you own VMware don t buy this game as you will get immediately banned
its pubg
After several million dollars in revenue and a really goddamn long time they still manage to have this game pretty much unplayable by laggs and getting shot when ur in cover After this long they should really have been able to fix these issues but apparently cosmetics are more important Because lootboxes meens more money
Awesome game Love playing it The only problem is the optimisation  the hackers still the overall experience is amazing and is worth it
This game is really bad but I still play it I mean this game has potential but it is almost unplayable STILL As of now I dont recommend it just based on the fact that it is an OFFICAIL game and it still has major problems
Basically buy this game if you want easy kills If the other people arent camping which is like 90  of the playerbase
this game is trash7510 great story
this game is horrible hardly works has lots of bugs and sometimes it doesnt let me play nothing personal but its horrible
Considering the size of the studio and the fact that it all started as an idea and recently made it out from Beta stage  I fully recommend this gameIf you re up for a challenge this game is one of the most addicting and random one I ve played in a whilePlaying alone is scary if you re a beginner sometimes I recommend playing with a friend or a group it s so much fun and harder as well Having only 1700 ranking points I still feel like I advanced a lot and with 250 hours in  I feel like I only know 10  of the mechanicstactics A lot to learn and discover yet you can feel how you advance through it Don t be sad if you don t win for the first few matches  or first 50 After all you ve got around 1  chance to win If you re looking for a team to play withteach you we re a gaming community  all different games and platforms from all around the globe that also play a lot of PUBG You can find us at https discordggKqt759v  See you there
Hacker Bad netcode and garbage optimization for PC and no new significant update for the game since 10 launch The game is a perfect example of why you shouldn t throw money on Early Access games This game is unplayable in current state can t give negeative rating
Hello my account is frozen I didn t use the cheat program My computer is very old I installed a program to optimize the game I hate and hate those who cheat in the program I hope they can relieve me of the freeze Thank
Potentionally great game Ruined by   client based hit detection   china laggers cheaters  region lock please nice replays always die when they totally miss  invisible obstackles when shooting  unlockable loot boxes   instead of thinking how to drain more money from the game instead of dealing with cheaters  unbalanced drop spawn no backpacks there and wow 5 in here but no weapon and I am dead  bad optimalization   map is too big just for 100 people    there are boring pasages when u are just spending 5 minutes getting somewhere and then u are dead  too long time on parachute and in a gathering point 60 seconds since there is enough people to start right in
To many cheaters
Want to play a frustration free skill based shooter with good net code  No  Well then this game is for you Featuring vehicle physics that kill you if you graze a solitary pebble or if the game rolls heads you can enjoy the scenic 8x8 Km maps until you get quick scope one shotted out of your vehicle by someone who had a suspicious lack of line of sight The game is kept interesting through the various randomized variables such as    Whether your ping beat the ping of the person you just exchanged gunfire with  It won t   Vehicles that are never there for you when you need them  Just like your dad  A loot system that dynamically increases the chance of you finding something you already havedon t need  Hey want a fifth Kar98 this round   Vengeful play area circles whose father you murdered in another life  Ooooh look another open field on the opposite side of the map as where you startedIn addition the game has attracted a diverse fun loving community of hackers your long lost 12 year old fathers and the Chinese Featuring an in game voice chat system you can chat with your fellow survivors in the lobby over the soothing sound of the N word and  China Numbah Wan  activists in converstations that would instantly bump the ESRB rating up to M If you do have any issues with the game you can always take your issue to the forums where you can get  Maybe developer feedback  Probably not on whatever your post is about  Yeah no If  When  not there s always the Good Samaritans who will try to give you the best advice they can  Git gud feggetIn conclusion this game provides wonderful experiences that will stay with you for as long as your newly smashed desk Ey wanna buy some skins

This games has its ups and downs like every game out thereSome positives are  Gameplay Combat Mechanics Driving Cars Fooling around People in voice chatSome negatives are  Sometimes untrustably FPS Servers get updated and are down alot Annoying toxic kids Getting killed right awayOverall I would rate this game a 9510 because its given me so much fun and I ve met so many great people on it CHINA 1 Hits
Having come from playing on the xbox one s to the pc i can truly say the experience is far better on pc not really hard tbhin the sense that its optimised for pc and doesnt really feel at home on console yetIn the short time that ive played on pc i have heard the phrase  china number 1  more times than ive actually had games loli play on EU servers and havent came across anyone that speaks english yeti still enjoy playing this game and people cant deny its addictive naturedespiste all its flaws id still recommend it
Please do not buy this game not only is it bugging and ugly looking but if you have a decnt machine you will not be able to run it even at the lowest settings Honestly spend 30 on a actual good game that actually runs just play fortnite as the devs seem to actually know how to use the engine they made My time in this game is so low because I cannot play this game and I must have triple the time in Fortnite
Its a great game with a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dev as all the other reviews say
so many cheater in this game please fix this
Decent game if they could still fix lag during combat
This is a great game Very fun and addicticting and much better than Fortnite
Still have not got rid of the hackers if I would have known it was going to get this bad I would have refunded this twitch LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game a loooong time ago
Shotguns too op send halp
Great game I think better than fortnite Better graphics and different play style
ResidentSleeper
This game is amazing and in my best opinion better than fortnite one thing that you could fix is that sometimes in the plane you cannot turn around to look where your going Please remedy this and then more people might paly again
this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  olny have bug and cheaters
Save your self some money and just buy literally anything else
2 ez
Nice game and i love all the players and please band all the cheaters 
My balls could optimize this game better
gud game boom boom oof yay
this game is so resident sleeper and rng LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but still has something interesting in it
The one big thing i dont like about the game is that you cant change your name cause i really hate my name and now im stuck with it choose carefully
Very bad game xenophobic redditors keep screaming about chinese people I am very disappointed  right now Earned a lot of money with the game because idiots keep buying lootboxes that is literally the only good aspect of this game
horrible loads of cheaters I have a 1080 gfx card and I play this game on LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  aabsolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  just to run 60 frames solid This game is so unoptimized I wish Ic ould get a refund FILLED WITH CHEATERS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing horrible korean LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t
No pang noob
Would be a fun game if i was good at itYou ll probably suck 2i hope
PUBG is dying
N1
This LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  nice
I love this game so of course I will recommend it With that being said I ve been a gamer my whole life and I have some opinionsIdeas First a slight increase in BP won I play a lot and generally do very well but it takes forever to earn it Second if we re going for realism  and I know this won t happen but bullet penetration would be a big plus in my eyes Third MORE GUNS Lol I feel so limitied and it gets boring after a while seeing the same thing over and over weapon wise I have a bunch of other ideas so Ill edit this over time with more AMAZING GAME  3 KEEP UP THE HARDWORK AND DEVELOPMENT
not as good as i expect but its fun when u play this game with friends
This game is fun long learning curve but even that is fun
Didn t think I would really enjoy the game honestly but after spending some time with it my mind has been changed I m sure after I get the hang of it I will absolutely love it Having trouble with getting kills with pretty much anything but wow this game is good If anybody has tip s on aim let me know
Great game Its fun and competitive There ARE a few bugs and it s pretty laggy but overall really fun
BEST GAME EVER 1110
Exit to lobby simulator 2018 since the new map  Please let us play the map we want to playThe game is solid we just NEED A MAP SELECT
One of the best games ever trust me I thought this game is bad and boring And now it s one of my favorite games
Still in EA after making so much stone cold CASH Stilll buggy still using stock assets Top that off with devs worrying about sueing other developers instead of finishing their game They also try to take more of your money by linking your progression to crates you can only open with keys you have to buy with real money Pathetic really Can t recommend this product no future in this project Devs have no integrity
First off I just want to say that PUBG has come along way in terms of development and it will no doubt change in the futureBut in the present I don t really recommend this game the development is rather slow and while it has left Early Access it feels like it hasnt left If you want to play a game in the Battle Royale genre then their are a few that are cheaper and will run better One in particular if you know what I mean Its and OK game and it will continue to be OK
Fortnight is better
WHY DO YOU DO MAINTENENCE DURING RUSH HOURS  ARE YOU GUYS STUPID  WHY DONT YOU JUST DO IT BY ZONE AND CHOOSE LIKE 4 AM  EVERYTIME I WANT TO PLAY 3 HOURS WAITING AT 10PM USA GEORGIA TIME 10 PM TTHE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY IS PLAYING THIS OMFG
Game keeps crashing full of hackers
This game is great There are however 5 major fallbacks1 Racist rants People on public chat preaching the kind of hate that they are think they re hilarious and think that this type of behavior is cool They need to be banned from the game steam should nt allow this type of behavior to be acceptable It s not funny that you re closet a racist I had to shut off the public chat  People would get the hint after a couple of bans2 You can t understand your team half the time because they re from China which makes squads really hard3 You can t play at certain times because the servers are too busy I paid 3000 for a game that I can t play  I kind of feel like if I can only play 50  of the time because the servers are full You should owe me 1500 With the amount of money they make off of this game you think they would do a lot more to correct this issue 4 There isnt a big selection in maps Although the maps are big its essentially the same content over and over 5 Cheating just like most FPS s I guess You do have the option of reporting a player if you think they re cheatingThis is a really fun game with potential to be much greater
6 months into a coma i realised that i needed to uninstall this garbage now im all good and well cancer cured
GOOD GAME
people who recommend this game are all the hackers wait
Amazing concept But I hope PUBG will add some new maps in the future
Games pretty good people who say there are hackers are just bad
I HATE THE GAME PEOPLE ABUSE THE FRIENDLY FIRE TOO MUCH THEY KILL THEIR TEAMATES WHEN THEY SAW BETTER LOOTS I RECOMMEND TO TURN OFF THAT LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING FRIENDLY FIRE OFF
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
Fix optimization and it will be better that s all I ask
THE BEST GAME EVER BETTER THAN FORTNITE WOOOOOO GET IT NOW FOR 2999  
i dont ussually play alot of video games but i had alot of fun playing this game   
It is really badly optimised that is all
I m gonna be honest  I haven t played this game much BUT every second I have played has been fun I know there are reports of massive numbers of people hacking but I haven t played in a while so I can t really comment on that I wish I had more time to play this game but I prefer others like Rainbow 6 I do however recommend this game for people looking for a fun competitive Battle Royale game as it is the best on the market as of when this was written
The crate system on the game is terrible Used two keys Got the same item twice You guys have to fix this issue The loot is wildly useless and often not worth the  spent to get keys Last time I get keys
Didnt find any dog in the game
Still many connecting issues and freak bugs the game left early access too soon

Not yet recommending this game until all the cheaters were gone plus they were like more CHINESE Auto aim plus no recoil they are just destroying the game I would recommend if you would ban the ip address whom uses cheats or region lock CHINA                                    
Good game 710 untill developers wont fix the bugs and broken physics

Ping abusers get the most chicken dinners
This is an awful game and a complete waste of money If youre a game creator and your game gets worse and worse after you release it as a full game you need to get a grip on your life and stop charging 40 USD for it You know exactly how to make this game better Green make server swapping a thing of the past to keep everyone pings down and all those chinese hackers out You addressed the chinese hackers on the H3H3 podcast yet youre doing little more than having more specific hack reporting that doesnt get followed up anyway Youve come a long way since youre ARMA days and for someone who claims to have sat in a bush and kicked all the player with high ping off youre original  mod server so everyone could have fun and enjoy their game you clearly have gone down hill I throughly do not recommend a game that got buggier and easier to hack after he made all of his money Youre a F     g sell out and you should be ashamed of yourself
relly like dis gaems everyday kill LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s  phew phew phew 
dont buy this game 3  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s hackers everywhere

The garbage lock area is discriminatory to justice in China and 2018  222 After the update  the  blue hole garbage dog LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
since the last update this game is unplayable   once again  i was glad they fixed the lag problem now they are back at square one please fix this problem then it is a really fun game to play and verty addictive
Garbage game lolNEED MORE LOOTBOXES 
it makes me wanna LOVE LOVE LOVE  in my panties
This game is 100  EA Ready Do you like bad load times  what about crashes and horrible content patches which pyshically break the game they are meant to improve  Then look no further This game offers you the chance to experience true hell1010 please just let it end
Best game 
this game gay
Could be a fun game if they fixed the issues Only fun if you have friends atm
Fun game  Very Addictive  it will be better as the hackers get weeded out  A few more maps would help All in all i give it a 65 10
nice game but many hacker
when my pc is good enough ill get this game again  refunded it
Daaaaaaaaang Been playing this for what feels like ages Super good
HALF OF THE GAMES I PLAY I CANT UNDERSTAND MY TEAM If you don t have friends that play this game you will more than likely be alone as far as the gameplay goes only a few bugs that are off and on chat seems to bug out on me alot all in all i give it a 35
Better buff SMG s
It s a good game Bit laggy at times and I want them to make a  potato  graphics setting so i m not constantly sitting on 7 11fps
Would be great for a free BETA not worth the money though Too many hackers and de sync problems
Horrible servers desperate need for optimasation Dosen t help that half the time the servers are  too busy  and no one can get in Guess the developers no longer care enough or just care about the money Such a shame since this game has so much potential
When do the servers work  When will there be no hackers  Why is it so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   When will the region lock begin  WHEN          
garabge
I love this game The cheating issues has gotten better with the updates  It s best if you play with a group of friends  or on a friendly discord channel
Great game Best shooter I ve ever played
One of the most exciting games to play with friends for years I bet all the bugs with get crushed and all the exciting new content will be to favor to the enjoyment of the community that supports this amazing shooter
The game is fun but at it s core PUBG broken The constant updates seem to fix anythig as I still recieve the same glithces over and over agian I don t think the game will ever be fixed Overall the game is fun to play with friends but leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth more often than not
Incredibly fun but frustrating game
I really dislike this game becuase it is so boring to play and to have fun you pretty much have to purposly avoid people so you dont see anyone until the final 10 when you get sniped from the other side of the map
Even though I think a developer could do much more with the insane amount of funds they received for this it s still the game that nailed the experience of the entire battle royale genre the best I do however also think that epic games has done more for the f2p game fortnite battle royale in a couple of months than these guys have in a year It is well deserved that fortnite took the crown I m eagerly awaiting a response from the devs here
I play to have fun most of the time So this is great to just jump in with friends and have a great time
Laggy Glitchy Slow af do not recommend
Almost in every game no matter in which server a cheater  you know from which country D will kill from behind using his super x ray googles I was against region locking too but now I think this is the only solution This game is currently a joke People should really stop playing it nowBtw I would have given this game a positive review because overall its fun for first 200hrs________________________________________Ha haha ha lol  Found it in reddit today https wwwredditcomrPUBATTLEGROUNDScomments82tadfi_have_met_superman_in_pubg_i_dont_mind_getting Also here are 2 clips from my side There were many more incidents like these but I just chose to ignore them as its uselesshttps wwwyoutubecomwatch vZ7U1oWHtfGo https wwwyoutubecomwatch vdw9x2Zv4w 0
Runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE  even on new hardware Not worth 30
We love the game it is a fantastic game   however EVERY SINGLE GAME is filled with hackers now I can basically guarantee every single day you play this game you will experience a hacker of some kindHackers Locking sights onto your location  THROUGH WALLS   checkAimbotting   checkGetting kills without their crosshairs being over you   checkLambert   checkIf the hackers are not taken care of it will completely destroy the game
Love the game The industry as a whole needed to learn that progression and crafting systems always come second to well developed gameplay mechanics Sure it still needs polish The game went viral in ways I ve never seen before so give the devs time to turn this into a blockbusterPoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i is mine

Interesting game Many of my friends recommend me to play this game
i didnt like it
You obviously ignore your player s requests for fixes and patches for war modes I cant stand this game anymore just give up Bluehole your game is going downhill
I ve put in an unexceptable amout of time into this game because it s more addictive than most hardcore illegal drugs In my  opinion this should be on the schedual 1 substance listAll kidding aside this game is fun when you aren t getting killed by a cheater every other game The devs seem like they don t give a flying  _ now that they made their millions and incorporated the MICRO TRANSACTIONS feature So now when you play you spend your in game points to buy  keys  to  unlock  new and  exciting  CLOTHES to put on your FAKE character It s pathetic honestly But hey I still play and have funwhen I don t encounter some nopu I ll change my review to possitive when EVERYONE is region locked so it s not RACIST which makes no sense how region locking china is racist if they are the main problem source of cheaters
A very good game but lag issues and does not feel fully polished yet
THERE IS ONLY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PLAYERS NO LOOT SHHIT PROGRAMERS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  AND HACKERSWEAPONS TY FOR TELL ME THEY ARE THERE ALLMOST FORGOT THAT ANYWAY LATE ME FISNIS THIS WITHFIX THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME
OK here is my story called  Caught in The Zone By TheRealistOne Today was the day Me and my comrades gh0st and stink were set a mission The mission seemed simple All we had to do was kill 97 other people on an island as we fight to be victorious However in the briefing they said that we weren t allowed to bring any weapons and that we had to scavange for our own supplies and weapons Even something as simple as a pan could kill someone We were all ready We were transported to a deserted island in the middle of Russia We had 1 minute to get our senses together and come up with a plan Stink said that we should go to a place called Rozhok We all agreed Then like magic all 100 of us were put on to a plane Some of the people on that plane were insane Screaming the N word or yelling things about China All I had on my mmind was to get the mission done and be victorious The doors to the back of the plane swung open and people began jumping out like cereal being poured into a bowl  Kelloggs sponser me pls We then said our prayers as we passed over Rozhok 1 by 1 we all jumped out as we were freefalling gh0st was dabbing we came close to Rozhok and pulled our parachutes We all landed but we were all at different sides of the town I ran into a 2 story house and found a AKM on the floor with some 762 lying on the floor I grabbed both and loaded my weapon I switched my gun into fully automatic and charged upstairs hoping to find some more supplies All I was able to find upstairs was a pan What was i going to do with a pan  Make an egg  Well I wasn t aware of the power of the sacred device known as the pan I jumped out of the window and ran to another house Then someone fired at me I turned around and returned fire I was shocked as i didn t know how i wasn t injured in anyway Then it clicked in my brain The pan saved my life i ran back out wielding the pan deflecting all of the guys shots I then got in range and smacked him around the head with it I didn t believe it I just killed a man who had an AR with a panHe turned into a brown crate which had a M416 with some 556 ammunition We scavanged around for a bit until we had filled our backpacks with medication ammunition and weapons We all grouped together as it was announced that the blue zone was going to shrink soon As we were together a blue dacia with one guy in it came straight towards us We all evaded it apart from stink who was hit He started crawling towards us As he crawled to us gh0st fired his beloved Kar98k at the dacia taking out 1 of the wheels The car spun out The driver got out and began to fire back at us Well mainly towards stink We both looked at him He was defenceless and couldn t do anything stink looked at as and told us to go Then the fatal blow that punctured his skull killed him We had to go Me and gh0st found a Motorbike parked on the side of the road and headed towards it We both got on it and left Rozhok          When we were driving around we noticed the plane flying by It dropped of a crate A supply crate Look we need to be the first one their  I yelled gh0st went as fast as he could but it was too late When we got there there were multiple enemies fighting Often stopping to drink a energy drink or eat some painkillers We both layed down in a bush I glanced over my right shoulder and noticed something unusual There was a bush next to us with another man laying down in it He was wearing a ghille suit and had acquired a M24 with a suppressor on the end of it to muffle his shots I told gh0st I then snuck up behind him Pulled out my sacred pan and hit him over the head Instantly killing him I grabbed his M24 and the ghille suit We then thought it would be good to leave the area Maybe they would drop another one  As we drove around we were told that only 15 people were alive This was including us We checked our electronic map and saw that the blue zone had came in a lot and that the circle was starting to become very small It looked like the circle was going to close in on a place called Mylta Power So we headed towards it We thought if we were the first one there we would have a higher chance of winning Then disaster stuck      As we were off roading on the bike gh0st decided to do a flip on the bike At this moment we were racing the blue zone as we didn t want to get stuck in it Mid flip gh0st said to me over the comms  I don t think we are going to land it And he was right We landed directly on our head knocking us off of the the bike The bike exploded as it bounced of the earth Gh0st was down but not out I was severely injured I was forced into using my medkit to get back to normal Then I noticed the blue zone coming in Gh0st was laying in a field with the blue zone heading straight towards him There was no way I was going to get him Like stink gh0st said to go The zone then engulfed him instantly draining the life out of him I had loads of pressure on me I had to move on       It was intense only 5 other people were alive  Including me I was laying in a bush as it made it harder to spot me I noticed a 2 women running in a field together 1 was wielding a M249 and the other had a pistol with a suppressor on it I held my breath and took the shot I took down 1 of the 2 people Luckily I had a suppressor which made it harder for her teamate to try and triangulate my location I took another shot Instanly killing her Both of them had been killed That meant that only 2 more people were alive I had to move as the circle was not in my favour When the time was right I darted across a field However I attracted to much attention as I was starting to get shot at I was so screwed I was able to get behind a tree I heard 2 people shooting at me It was a 2v1 I didn t know what to do I was running low on ammoI had to use the remaining amount of ammo I had left even if it wasn t a lot I leaned around the tree and was shot down straight in the face breaking my helmet I was badly injured I had nothing to heal up with This was it I was sweating profusely I had to take another shot I leaned around again and was shot down I was killed there      All my friends were mad at me We then exited to the menu and instantly queued for another game We then won that gameThe End
Great and fun game
It s a ight
Pretty good actually
This game WAS funHowever now cheaters are everywhere in every matchAnd the elo is literally the rank of performance of cheating programsThis situation rapidly kill players  patient and passion on this gameBut it seems that the developers are not able to fix this problem
The most overrated game of 2017 hands down  Its not bad per se  but there are just better games in the genre  like Fortnite  The community is also absolute garbage  with toxic LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s hating on every battle royale game  even though PUBG isnt even the first one  Its also full of glitches and the servers are still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
i cant log in now for an hour can you fcing fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  omg evry fcing time says server are too busy stop doing updates and fix your servers omg after 400 hours still cant log in
Cannot play anymore Used to get 100 fps now get 30 Broken Will not play until its fixed Stay clear
honestly im 171 hours in and came to the realization that i absolutely hate this game it is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dont ask me why ive yet to figure that out but it is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i will say there is an addiction to it i still play with friends but i havent played solo in like 50 games and i dont plan to ever play it again in the future i think the only enjoyment you get is if you play with friends  that is just an opinion i dont recommend this game not even slightly has nothing to do with stream snipers or hackers this game is just bad 
works well for what it is Has gliches but not bad at all WA 2 much fun to be had if you like continualy working tords NOTHING lol
This game is awesome But I will stop playing due to the EXTREMELY high botters within the game The game developers should seriously take the time to narrow in on getting these individuals banned a lot quicker The cheating problem has just costantly gotten worse and making it very frustrating for all individuals who actually enjoy the game I can not think of a game that I have recently played and have not gotten either killed by a aim bot or no recoil Please inform me when these issue are resolved and you may have a returning customer but untell then fairwell pubg
u gay lol
Spent 30 on  Servers are too busy  do yourself a favor and stay away from this title until the developer actually decides to work on their game and not just milk money outve people
It s Riddled with Chinese players in North American servers They are going to have a 2 seconsd edge on you and most likely not speak english Do yourself a favor and go make a Epic account and just play Fortnite
Nice game but can t recommend Stop putting me in the         desert map
Very fun game has memes
beste investemento in mya liff
Too random inconsistent and luck based Not to mention the bugs
        
it fun game and beter then fortnit
bad game no like
ITS THE BEST BATTLEROYALE GAME IN THIS WORLD but i would like to see more optimisation in this game  EAST OR WEST PUBG IS BEST  i play hours and hours on this game LOVED IT 
100  player hackers
killer game
Damn Chinese
Game is broken in every way one of the worst games ive ever played like literally 90  luck 10  skill You never know who is actually good at the game due to the massive amount of randomness ive won a game with 1 kill by staying in a hut and just getting lucky with the zone being on me the entire time and ive demolished an entire server with like 15 kills and still lost skill literally means nothing A global elite in csgo can acutally lose every game
If you enjoy little chinese boys dicking you every game with NO LIE wall hacks and aim hacks then this is the game for you I ve owned this game since it was in Early release and it was decent Just before 10 it was really enjoyable but since the CHINESE INVASION of 10 this game has gone to absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Every game you enter you hear the silent whisper of the dirty chinese Taunting you with their strange dialect Oh and if you are getting your hopes up that Player Unknown is going to region lock these chinese hackers just dont He loves China CHINA ALL THE TIME So bottom line here is you shouldn t waste your money on this game because obviously their newly implemented highly advanced anti hacking measurements are a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing joke Get your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together Player Unknown or you are going to lose the people who have made this game big for you Thank you for reading my review   REGIONLOCKTHELOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE INGCHINESE
Really just a terrible game And yet my friends keep playing it then so do ITerrible optimization terrible gameplay booring as hxxxBut when you win it is a lot of fun
lags whenever I start shooting someone filled with bugs but hey at least we have new crates who needs a finished game
it still appears there are far too many exploits available  A lot of bugs and crashes   far too many for as mature as this game should be INHO  Sadly as much as I still want to try and find some enjoyment in playing there are just better ways to spend mytime
Guns don t reload hackers everywhere de sync d every other game How any company can make this much on a game and still manage to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the bed is beyond me
I ve got 2 things to say about this game Region lock the Chinese and fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing collision meshes  for EVERYTHING
2699 for a Chinese simulatorChinaNumberOne
I run it at lowest setting and resolution and it only gives me 20 fps i will most likely refund it
Laggy serversRubberband mode always onstuttery performance on best hardwarehit detection non existant
Yawn waste of money do NOT buy  About as exciting as watching paint dry
one word to explane it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Not Fortnite
I can t anymoreFirst let me say this game is fun with friends its gameplay although to me a bit clunky is still enjoyable what you see in videos of this game is what you get and thats all the positivity i can give this gameNow i must say the reason s i cant recommend this game to anyone anymore1 CRASH COUNTRY this game is so godforsakenly awful for this reason alone it happens so randomly but OFTEN there was a time when i first got this game the crashes were only occasional and only a nusence but now every time i get on i cant stop crashing and its usually in the middle of a game i crash it has nothing to do with my PC and its only this game it crashes on2 HACKER CITY now i know you think im just one of those salty people that call hacks on everything but im not this is when its genuin 100  proof that someone is hacking i call hacks I review the deathcam and watch someone aim at me the point the gun downwards not facing me anymore then shoots and kills me and usually when im in top 10 left of the game3 BUGGYVILL So whenever i do manage to get back on to the game  assuing it wont crash again some of the older bugs in early access pop up and suddenly im able to go through walls and cant pick up any weapons also i was with a squad that didnt know i was there squadmate because my squad blimp above a squadmates head was now in the middle of the ocean so to my own teammates i was just another enemy there are alot of bugs like this in the game stillYou know if this game was still in early access i wouldnt even give this a bad review id just say  its still fun and has lots of potental  which is still true but now as a fully realeased title to me its just another rushed out product a popular one at thatThe only reason i would even want to play now is either with friends or if i wanna just get on and earn BP for crates  CRATES BTW ARE THE REASON PEOPLE HACK AND KEEP REBUYING THE GAME PRICES ON CRATE ITEMS ARE REDICULOUS its sad that people only want to play for overpriced cosmetics and not even for the game itself
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bad
Garbage mechanics money grab loot crates laggy servers and cluncky movement garbage game overall how do people get this types of garbage games trending
Just as everyone else I hate the fact they refuse to region lock China Adding on to that you entice people to cheat by having loot boxes that you get by winning games and kills Some of the items sell for over 1k and sure you can ban them but as soon as you do all that happens is they create a new account All the while the corporation are just getting their pockets lined with cash The icing on the cake though has been the recent bans of players for harrasing streamers An innocent player just having fun and honking the horn or sometimes they kill the streamer without cheating Next thing you know you are banned for something you didn t even realize Trying to get the ban reversed is impossible as the developers no longer care about the players At first the game wasn t that bad you could deal with the cheaters and still enjoy the game Now the whole thing is so overrun by cheaters I can barely land in any area without getting shot and I can t even findout where from With the new death cam I can see a player just shoots randomly in the air and I m dead Like come on this has got to a point where this game has just become a cheating gambler s playground And the developers just sit there and do nothing to fix it
RegionLockChinaThis game is right now so poisened with cheaters and hackers Every f king game is hoping you can get from cover to cover to survive some hacker with Kark and reddot There were times when you met a hacker every 5 10 rounds but not every f king game This is hilarious and I am disappointed from the publisher Are you selling the game in Asia in an  Hacker Edition   Is this some well organized game destruction campaign  Do something
Chinese aimbotter in every game
8510 without MiramarPlease remove Miramar If you were to make another map make it Erangel2 then set both Erangel and Erangel2 to a 50  pick rate Watch profits soar
I paid 20 for thisI opened 3 crates so far without spending any money and I ve made 6432 in steam creditAside from basically being given my money back x3 I m enjoying this gameHaving a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  day  Jump into a populated zone and rambo that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Having a good day  PUBG can fix thatIt s fun especially with friends and even making random pals in solo is pretty interesting WWCD
Nice Gane
so many plugs that makes me cant be placid
hardcore competitive gamers will find themselves needing a new headset every other day cause they threw their last one at their monitor after they died from d sync lag or a hackercasual gamers who play for fun will find themselves just as infuriated and annoyed cause the game is utter and complete sh t1010 would play again
Why did I play Jedi survival was sealed for three days and now unsealed don t play show vac banned ha ha blue hole company Is that how efficient you are 
I love this game definitely worth the money although at the moment there are alot of hackers that just ruin your fun But besides the hackers this game is amazing and I feel like it will be that way forever

plz ban the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chinese hacker region lock the china
RIGGED CASES FOR STREAMERS LULshroud open 15 cases and get about 300 dollars when other 999  players get  1dollar
With more and more updates this game has become more and more unplayable TOO MANY BUGS AND MISERABLE FPS Indeed this game once brought me a lot of pleasure playing with my friends but now we all have no motivation to play this game
A good arena shooter with a grasp on realistic mechanics Gameplay is entertaing and I found it somewhat easy to survive in this game With the large distance between locations and randomized loot it can be difficult to find good loot and with the large game area its easy to go long periods of time without action
China
Some new update on Feb 22 or 23 and now I can t run the game  Right now I have to not recommend the game  When it did work earlier today the game was really laging and the deathcam had stopped working  Not sure what the update did but it was really bad
If you like running around and getting shot by terrifyingly accurate men in trench coats this game is for you                 
a laggy piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that s overrun with Chinese hackers  ping abusers the rest of the player base complains about it we get called xenophobic by the developers optimisation lol  someone slapping their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  against the keyboard would have done a better job  I would recommend going and playing fortnight it is free to play and runs 100  better and they are actually trying to deal with the hackers I would go as far as to say anything by this developer should be avoided
amazing game a few kinks here and there but overall i think its pretty original and great
Too many updates please LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off
DON T STEP ON SNEK
cheaters at every turn used to love this game now its going to crap
Each patch gets the game in a worse condition even to points where its not playable Back in early access my computer could handle the gameRight now im happy if the lobby loads just in time to jump out of the plane Save the money for some steam sales
This is a game full of hackersby full ofI mean there are more than 5 hackers in one match and Bluehole can t do anything about it Normal players don t even think about to have fun in this game DO NOT PAY FOR THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME
STUTTERING ALL THE F CKING TIME CONSTANTLY SINCE THE NEW UPDATE WHAT ON EARTH IS BLUEHOLE AND BRENDAN GREENE DOING THEY MAKE THE GAME WORSE CONSTANTLY
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t game
This game s pretty much the most successful asset flip of all time shame because if competent development along with some attention to detail was put into this product it d be decent but ZERO attention to detail was put in it s developmentMost of the assets are barely scaled properly all bought off the Unreal engine store the serversnetcode are all bad half the game is spent rubber banding and lagging who wins the engagements for the first half of the match is already extremely RNG and then for the second half of the match the servers settle down to acceptable levels  mostly however you have to deal with the game s horrible stiff shooting probably among the worst feeling and performing shooting ive tried on an unreal game hard to believe this game is on the same engine as the new Unreal Tournament game that has excellent shootingThis is saying nothing of the game s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  performance though not that big an issue for my PC it is for others then you got stuff like picket fences that you should obviously be able to shoot through or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing metal bars or chairs that shouldn t block bullets BLOCKING BULLETS an example of this game s lack of detail is how the license plates on the vehicles are modern Polish license plates but the game obviously takes place in some former USSR backwater area of Russia with Russian names n Cyrillic in the towns and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   probably following DayZ s lead with Chernarus but that map is actually quite detailed because Bohemia unlike Blueballs are good at that sorta stuffOverall you re better off playing Fortnite since it s developed by people with experience in shooters and that know what they re doing unlike PUBG which is developed by badly paid asset flipping former MMO developers when you die in a game like Siege or CS or Insurgency even though one is run by Ubisoft it s probably your fault because those games  shooting and servers are top notchWhen you die in PUBG it s almost always thanks to server RNGgames horrid optimization LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing you over it s not a well made game and I doubt it will be in the future considering Bluehole can take my spot for one of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iest developers in history all the money in the world can t save their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  development A PUBG with tight servers and Insurgency quality shooting would be excellent even with the state of the maps and weapons etc etc  all asset flips but that ll never happen
In all honesty the game is just not worth the 30 dollars Fortnite is free and it has less hackers Aside from that the game is constantly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing up in one way or another Save your money and build some walls in fortnite

dont like the controls or gameplay physics at all blah glitchy
I enjoy the game quite a bit however I am left disapointed the movement seems sloppy visibility is a joke and the physics are broken render times go on for ever and I constantly have to restart I expected more for a game so popular
Gun fights are terrible bullets never go where you aim not a solid game with updates that actually help the game become batter good idea and addictive but not worth the 27 at the moment  Aswell cant call a game BATTLE ROYALE when there no decent loot any where on the map and the spend the first 10 15 minutes just wondering around the map and opening doors to find nothing sometimes i feel like it is a BTEC version of DAYZ with worse devs aqd a system where you can see where you are being shot from every time come across LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  players who cant aim and have no idea where they are sooooo annoyingBLUEHOLE plz sell the game u have no idea how much LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you make the game and never ever call it a solid game die
Carbon Copy of Rules of Survival
Hax Hax everywherez xxgame is still good tho besides the hax
A garbage game that somehow has gotten less optimized the more updates that come out cannot play this game without freezing every 1 5 seconds with a high end rig Do not buy this terrible mess of a game
Stop doing extra       for the love of god Get the beggining lag out of there keep it at 30hz at least    this     is unplayable It s unplayable becuase you guys keep adding s  t we don t want I never got this laggy game until the plane UI element was added Now every game is   stuttering Please work on your server tick rate before you add some other gimick is that to much to ask  I usually got the looting lag where i had to pick LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up twice but now its like literally running at 8fps  but still says im at 120fps FIX YOUR     GAME      SHOULD STILL BE IN EARLY ACCESS Games a fun  but please focus on the       thats important not      keys for skins Thats another thing buying a key for 250 WTF most popular game on steam and you guys are tring to get more money from us wo delivering a stable game I love PUBG but i cant kepp doing this    
The game is just a tilter even at 60 fps and good ping the game feels clunky and the movement is god awful
Pubg is really good game i enjoy it but for the love of god make the hit detection server sided or region lock China
Amazing game 100  worth buying
DOG
Dont buy this game because the servers are always either too busy or laggy as F    All the updates to this game are for trivial things like the sounds I d say everyone who got this game got extremely disappointed They acknowledged the issue with their servers 5 months ago and its literally exactly the same Nobody cares about new guns if the game is BROKEN
Everyone gets a participation trophyAm I playing a differnt game than evryone else

CHAINA NUMBA WAN 
Needs double pump
IF you want to play this game get ready to face cheaters every SINGLE match
gud game 810
There are so many hackers in this game This is the worst game  that I ve ever played
As the game was in early access I thought PUBG had a great concept It was fun and interesting a little buggy in the beginning but was fun to playWith the official  Release  of the game it began to become much worse No map selection after almost three months rampant cheating uncooperative teammates which only speak chinese on EU servers more bugs and glitches than the time it was in EA Everyone is screaming to let the chinese players play on their own servers to be free of the plague The Chinese Publisher of PUBG Tencent is even helping hackers to sell their cheats with their payment and messaging platform They even post adsTo make matters worse  There hasn t been a single decent update or patch since the official release of the game The upcoming  update 6  is going to give us another loot crate for cosmetic items which we need to pay 25 to openAt least the devs got the resources to make new loot cratesI am done with this trainwrack of a gameA sincere LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  You to Blueballs Entertainment aka PUBG Corporation
This game good
Pretty bad game Still play it everyday
you need to do file checks when people are entered into matches starting to see people deleting foliage and other files so the trees have no foliage on them Causing some serious issues as this should be something any cheat buster should catch
Spend 45 minutes looting get killed by a chinese hacker in 3 seconds  E sports readyDevs refuse to region lock china even though 99  of banned accounts are chineseShifting development from improving game towards crates  Because clearly they dont make enough money from the chinese hackers  Could be a great game but lack of a real anti cheat lack of region lock really ruins the fair playIf you want a fair and balanced Battlegrounds game this is not it
We need linux support 
Formed two squads with my bros Rode motorcycles off of cliffs Laughed Raged Cried Laughed some more Only killed two people in an entire eveningAll in all a great family reunion Also PUBG is fun
Addict
This game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
They normified a good game
SAVE PUBG                                    NO MATTER WICH REGION YOU ARE IN IT S NOT POSSIBLE TO GET PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ENGLISH IN SQUADS OR DUO AND THE FIRST MATCH OF DUO I GOT TEAMED UP WITH AN HACKERi knocked him as fast as i found out and then i just stood there looking at him for a while then picket him up thinking he would kill me so i could report himhe didhe had a regen hack wich makes his health regen as fast as he takes damage
This game is garbage Everytime you try to play you are overrun with non english speaking asians flooding Oceanic  or any servers How are you suppose to communicate in a team game with these jokers  Also 99  of the hackers come from China and Blueballs continues to do nothing  Region lock China I can t wait for the next patch where they do nothing to address the issues and bring out another revenue stream for themselves It is greedy and disspointing from the developers as this game has so much potential
Absolutely stupid how many times cheaters kill me and how many people are using hacks I don t know what you need to do to fix this but they need region lock and spend a few bucks stopping this cheating Completely ruins the game for me Fix cheats and lag and I ll recommend this game but until then I will not
very fun and relax game but so many hackers
Don t buy this game Crashes constantly Cheaters galore LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game10
This game will die in 6 months
Here s a list of names of cheaters I ve encountered in the game  minus ones that I ve forgotten because I usually just leave the game and forget the names after or recordings can t be viewed again for some ungodly reason THE_REAL_ENDGAMEI ll continually list players that I personally have caught  Send me or comment others that you have caught and reported or caught and haven t yet  Doesn t matter really if you find them list them
Muy buen juego buenas ideas pero muy malo el ANTICHEAT lleno de asiaticos walleados aimboteros etc
One of my favorite multiplayer games but there are some bugs and this game requires a strong PC and great shooting skills
This is a really good game that you can play for hours and i recommend everyone to try this game
Fix the hackers
i want a refund
Pros Gameplay is awesome when it works as intendedCons Endless bugsLots of cheatersUseless devs that focus on more content rather than working contentWhat you have here is a game that is based on a great idea the gameplay could be amazing but it is overshadowed by terribly programming endless bugs little to no QOL updates and endless amount of hackers When it runs smoothly and you re not the victim of some idiotic bug playing is a truly cool experience When you fall through the floor and die get tossed of a building for no reason and die hit an invisible wall while driving a vehicle and die Not so much The current state of the game is what I would expect from a game in early alpha not a fully developed game The fact that the devs chose to focus on releasing guns maps and new clothing instead of fixing their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game just goes to show how moronic they are No wonder their numbers are droppingIf this was developed by people who knew what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  they were doing it would be awesome Sadly this is not the case
PUBG is a great game It expanded the battle royale series from H1Z1 and greatly improved upon it The graphics are decent and the developers have actually improved optimization However for 30 and the emergence of the new free to play Fortnite I do not think there is a compelling reason to purchase PUBG The game has many hackers due to the developers not region locking China and this influx of hackers has made the game not very fun to play Additionally the games seems to play very slowly compared to Fortnite with 95  of the game just looking for enemies and driving around where in Fortnite it s much closer to 50  The shooting feels poor compared to Fortnite and overall the game just feels old Another area where Fortnite shines is its art style and optimization It is very easy to get a locked 120fps with high or even ultra settings on Fortnite Therefore while the game is still good I cannot recommend it over Fortnite due to the price the slowness the hackers and the graphics
pls OPTIMIZEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
One of the best games ever created
they broke the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game i cant LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing turn my character anymore
Gets boring after a while Lots of cheaters I don t get expensive stuff from cratesIf you want to have fun don t take this game seriously and keep in mind that the only way to deal with cheaters as of now is to avoid playing the game I still recommend it though
No need to talk
LOTS OF BUGS
Too many hackers Maybe developers of this game are the ones who sell those hack 3 Months after release not a single patches that are effective against hackers
Too many hackersand its content are dedespicable inside
Have no idea how the game is bought it and crashes every damn time less than 30 secs into a game test server wont open at I have never felt this stolen from by a steam game
BLUE HOLE FIX UR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE bugs everywhere  this game needs improvment    Game does not respond when i press ready and this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  won t fix just by restarting lobbyplus there are too many in game bugs such as flying rocks and people swimming in the airFirst fix your bug and then make a second map
yes is ture gamebut there are not many Koreans
Chinese region lock needed badly can t recommend the game in it s current state
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PUBG CORP they are the most incompetent C U N T S when it comes to hacker s so many promises to fix hacker problems and all these wasted updates  anti cheat reportable cheat options FOR WHAT         To anyone who want s to play this game it can be fun and i mean really fun but tbh it s not worth the  as the dev team fail fail and fail some more when it comes to listening to their audience and control the hacking problem on this gameYou will  get shot through walls be killed by aimbot be purposely team killed and almost every person who is doing this is CHINESE  and they will voice upon killing you   CHINA NUMBER 1  Well this is what i say LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PUBG CORP and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  CHINA
Chinese hackers the video game Crashes more now than on launch Trash game with bad lag
Hackers Hackers and more HackersBut dont worry about that cause we have loot boxes you can buy with real moneyLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Quite not badBut my computer almost crashed
Get this game is you want to get aimboted what feels like every game I love this game and what they re trying to do with it but cheating is out of control
cheaters but otherwise fun
Recent Balancing update broke the game more then it fixed it
The game is technically awful as far as coding and mechanics the battle royale game mode saves it a tiny bit
Gud but not good sometimes should be a map filter and the option to change the default firing mode when guns are picked up 3 Seater bike is terrible
trash game cant play duos with someone that speaks english hackers named 98fa8943 dont get banned LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hitboxes and laggy people that die can get a few shots off before the game full kills them shoot someone from 5 feet away with 15 762 rounds and they dont die
Horribly optimized sort of feels like it s a virus on your computer from time to time Crashes unexpectedly about 20  of the time Can be a lot of fun if it s not running like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  There s no reason for this game to be at the state it s at right now wish the dev s would do something with the millions and millions of dollars they have made so far But nope
region lock the chinese playersmost chinese players I ve delt with are all hackers and they cause lag and I want to like this game but the hackers and chinese people are ruining the game
Bluehole said they put a new anti cheat system in Ever since the  anti cheat system  was implemented I have seen more hackers in PUBG in a week than I ve seen in CS GO all my life Very unplayable right now Please fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Can t select which map you want to play on
Game is to way cool and very addictive  more powers to this game hope it will last forever
Hey wow Its pretty good
After 300 hours of playing this game I don t recommend buying it at this point Absolutely nothing with regards to the main issues changed between beta and 10 I regularly die 2 seconds after someone shoots at me when I m already in cover sometimes shots don t register the hitboxes are ludacris early game desync makes the game unplayable in busy areas parachutes get stuck regularly loot spawn is seriously flawed the amount of cheaters is absolutely in sane I could go on and on Doing well in this game is directly related to which bugs are in your favor and how lucky you are Skill is a much smaller factor I sincerely hope they fix the game to a point where the servers are stable and the hackers are rare until then do not buy this game
Everything
pubg could have been a great game but it has been ruined every step of the way because rather than trying to fix serious issues with their came bluehole focus on adding things that will make them money I commend playerunknown and bluehole is a beyond pitiful company
Garbage bugs from alpha are still present not worth the 30
Quality of game sucks  countless bugs and more incoming I dont think the devs care about the community and that makes me think these bugs wont be fixed
Awesome  D
Good game  better played with a buddy or a squad
HACK HACK HACK HACK
BEST GAME EVER KAPPA
too many Chinese kids
F   k  do we paid this game to killed by a hacker    KAR98 HS without aim  Instant heal  Wtf Devs do something for god sake  especially China player 
Playerunknown s CheaterGrounds
So in my opinion i think the game has only gotten worse over the time Especially since the 10 update Yes the game as amazing graphics but was it really needed  I think the game before was much more welcoming and don t get me started on vaulting i think after they added that to the game i and many other could just run around on the map like a headless chicken and the removal on crouch jumping took a lot of skill away from the game This used to be my favorite game and i think it is very sad the road this game took Now it is filled with hackers and i mean 13 games i get killed by a guy that shot me in the head 3 times across the map without any recoil and it doesn t seem to stop

PUBG is a full example of how the gaming industry s standards are dropping Releasing a game that crashes frequently has numerous bugs that effect gameplay and plenty of other annoying things like gun spawns that seem to be random thus creating games where you drop in loot 3 7 house only to find a pistol This game should be in early access not a full releaseDespite all its drawbacks i do still recommend getting it as it is a fun game to play solo or with friends just note that you will experience frequent bugs and crashes that will make you think this is an early access game

Dis geim is not veri gud
In order to add some perspective to my review I have over a 1000 hours on this game and I play it daily However it is a very broken game  so totally broken Do NOT buy it It used to be a good game but now the cheating has completely ruined it completely EVERY SINGLE GAME there are multiple cheatershackers I havent played a game in the last two weeks where there hasn t been a cheater And this is after they applied their anti cheat fixes It has become a fu king joke As it stands this game is unplayable Don t waste your time or your money like I have
 rep have nices hacks in game
Yes it has flaws but damn is it fun
I purchased this game with the intention of enjoying it over 8 months ago and finally make my review after 250 hours played With all the hype surrounding this game I whole heartedly believed this would be a genuinely good game boy was I wrong what an over hyped piece of hot garbage Pros  It is mildly entertaining when played with a group of friends for short periods at a timeCons The terrible frame drops the crashes the glitches the bugs the lag the hackers the campers the continent of Asia completely overruning the Oceania servers the garbage loot drops and vehicles it s absolutely disgusting The  patches haven t fixed anything and if anything it s made the game worse
 be me running through small houses with friends finds noice loot my dude walks into apparentment complex hears  look bro I know someone s in here wanna be friends   look at friend friend yells back  lmao hell yeah dude  meets with new friend new friend and I make eye contact a bromance is formed new friend yells for other friend to come over new friend begins to play Pumped Up Kick on roof we dance for 15 minutes  we begin to run new friends kill usOver all was a good expirence Rating  Gucci Belt10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I don t liek
best game for squad
After playing this game for nearly 100 hours in total I have to say it s a decent game for fun with your friends It has it s downsides like all the hackers in the current stage of the game But it s quite easy to come within the top 10 if you re decent at the game and within the top 5 if you are lucky or just good In my experience if you stay in the circle get geared up and have a good team you can make it pretty far and possibly get the chicken dinner Although I don t play competitively as its annoying to spend 20 minutes looting and killing people just to be killed by a cheater at the end of the game Its still fun and worth a buy if you want to mess around with friends
Very funny cool and good
Right now this game is unplayable You find a cheater 23 games Just disgusting Example https youtubeHF4sTeczxik
This game is literally useless Each game there s couple of cheaters that are able to kill you across the whole map Comparing to CS GO CS was cheating free game 9 games in a row and there are always chinese cheaters LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
Cant recomend right now buggs desync and cheaters make this game bad experience
PUBG is not even close to being a finished 10 product yet they released it  At this point it s basically an asset flip  Horrible optimization and netcode  North American servers are infested with laggy Chinese hackers  Just wait for the next Battle Royale game don t buy this
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE  and you can just be driving and then get stuck where you can t move there are to many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hackers and it was mad by autistic monkeys
esportready
What the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i jump down in the water thats 10 meters deep and die in falldamage LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this gameUPDATE  just now i played with my friend and of course we had a bike we were out of the circle and i LITTERALY hit a guy but it didn t render  WHAT  REALLY WTF
Fun game But why cant you let players choose what map they want to play  Seems like a rookie option and yet wont include that option I typically enjoy playing most of the time I am on but im really tired of not being able to pick which map I want to play Until you make this an option I do not recommend
1000h on this game and still want to make moretho when will the new updates come 
I personally think pubg is a great game and deserves your 30 dollars and time However the lag issues and optimization are actually horrible not to mention the cheaters and the poor anti cheat system If this game could optimize and improve its anti cheat it would be my favorite game However it is just not up to par with other battle royale games 7510
 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  1010
bug
No idea how this game is supposed to be ready Its unfinished and not working
this game is so fun even tho i suck the feeling of getting to top 10 is great
Cheater Cheater Cheater Hacker Hacker Hacker They are ruining this GAME 510020
best game ever made
Don t bother Hackers galore and awful engine
Game is good except for three things1 Too Many Chinese2 Majority hack or team kill3 Desert map is wankOther than that it is a good game
I ve put alot of hours into this game because its not the same as the usual FPS games It has potential But the developer is awful at their job In a year or more s time they ve released 2 maps Bugs that were apparent six months ago are still in play The loading screen UI is still buggy And the cheating IT IS ENDLESS For a time it was only on TPP servers but now its become apparent on the FPP servers Take a look at any of the top ten players for ANY of the modes and chances are its the same guys that have been cheating for months Bluehole is making no effort to even police the low hanging fruitguys with KDR through the roof They will likely not fix this I ve pulled alot of hours out of this game so there is a value to that But the hacking only gets worse and worse and you watch a game you really enjoy just make you madder and madder Bluehole has no idea what htey are doing and Brendan Greene is clueless I cannot reccomend this game at allbecause it s not going to get betterBut hey at least they ve got more loot boxes
Mfw bad pcnoclip trough buildings 110
Very Gooot
its really bad game allways has crash and bug  when i close the game and i wanna come again i the game its give me 262 mb update  its really  shitly game  3
This game has incredible potential However this game has so many issues including but not limited to 5 to 1 second peakers advantage full autos hit registration HACKERS GALORE and optimization issues I think if they focus more about creating a game rather than marketing things such as there movie and sueing people they might make some progress on creating a better experience Don t get me wrong the game has come a long way since it s release but the fact that they aren t releasing solid updates anymore and creating more content rather than fixing coding and making the game a more playable and competive experience makes me not want to play this game sometimes I know many players feel frusturated when they die across the map from a hacker or they shoot a guy die to him watch the death cam and see that none of thier bullets hit the person The game needs so much help and It s disturbing the shear lack of progress being made towards improving the game I will still play the game but honestly cannot reccomend it to anyone until these issues start being adressed because they want this to be an epsort It is not esport ready and the fact that other people can make simialair games with as many people and not have nearly as much lag shows that Bluehole needs to get there      together and start making there game better
what a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game crashes on the loading  screen crashes in vehicles not being able to shoot through railings overall one of the worst games ever that i cant stop playing
A fantastic fun game definitely suggest  D
get these chinese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s out of oce and NA
great game id rate it a 2010 if I could
instead of Region lock just Ping lock that way you can make everyone happy without insulting anyting  COUGH  CHINESE PEOPLE  COUGH 
This game in a nutshell PlayerChinaman s  RicefieldsAlso                                     
This game would be fun if it worked Every game I play there is atlest 1 hacker I confirm this by watching the death cam instaheadshots no recoil walls ect is a common occurance It is really sad that a game that makes so much has so many problems Hackers are not the only problem Lagg as well as other glitches are a common occurance as well If this game was more polished and was not as easy to hack this could be a great game On a final note I have won many times Its not impossible to win but its very hard when players snap to your head can see you through walls and have no recoil
Everyone by this time should know more than enough about this game I m here to shame Bluehole for mixing in locked crates with non locked crates that you can purchase with earned in game points LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you and the 250 price tag for a key If I wanted to buy a crate with real money I would But when I use the sparsely given in game credits and receive a locked crate in return thats money grabbing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tAlso the new map blows There is zero action at any given time I love dropping in and lootingwandering around for 20 40 mins only to be sniped by some LOVE LOVE LOVE  I cannot see on top of a mountain
Its laggy as crap
Good Games  3
A good game but there are so many hackers that s impossible to playAs long the developer let them go away with this there s no hope
after 1200h playing and several times top 100 i can say the game is top the support FLOPCheater in every single game  Aimbot  wallhack  instant healrezzi leave this game now because it s unplayable at the moment
If you like getting killed after 20 minutes of wandering alone Or dying because a vehicle gets tossed up in the air Go ahead

This seems like a good time for a drink and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones A speech about politics about order brotherhood power But speeches are for BOOM dead 1010
DIS GAME IS DA BOMB
Game kinda sucks  Gunplay isn t fun  It s so much runningdriving  It looks like trash  Poor and spikey frames per second  I can see it being a little addicting but It s just not very fun
Great game The mid game is very slow and there are a fair few hackers but the game makes up for it with extremley fun gameplay and a cool cosmetic system Best battle royale game that i have ever played
Grab a hack and join in the fun or enjoy getting headshot through a lvl 3 helmet from 1km away with a pistol from a hipfiring guy with a name like Hghj33tei9 Terrible game

Pros   cool ideacons   Trying to make money off of loot boxes as if this game were the same quality as CSGO Game was not even out of Beta before the scam tactics began  No concern for the actual playerbaseThe game is a battle royal mode you start PVP against 100 players in solo duo or a team and your goal is to be the last remaining You will start out in a field with 99 people punching one another then go to a plane full of 40 screaming asains yelling  China 1  40 year old men saying racist things while eating their mic or 12 year olds talking about forced intercource with youyour mom Normal stuff in todays gaming chat but you can t really expect any adult conversation here like in other gamesI honestly don t suggest anyone buy this game  In a normal game it is way easier to deal with cheaters in this game you spend 25 minutes running around picking up loot to watch a kill cam of some guy staring at a wall suddenly shoot and kill you at distances you didn t think were posibleThe game is I guess out of Beta but still buggy and laggy as if it were in Alpha Half the time the textures don t load before drop  SLI 1070 or single 1070 does not matter I play Arma II   Arma III so for the issues not to be present for me in either of those games but show up here seems odd to me The controls are super clunky like no game I have ever played before it feels like everything is big and blocky and aiming is mostly a game of chanceNo I don t have 300 500 or a 1000 hours in this game I don t think that means those are the only people able to review this game Just means they have spent huge amounts of wasted time imoMy favorite story is the chinese guy in duo who drove me to the out of bounds and then tried running me over repeatedly REGION LOCK CHINA
Great game but please region lock china Poor performance due to network latency China is on the whole other side of the world and it takes longer for the data to get over to the USA from China Would be nice to just play with people who had the same speed and connection as I have Overwatch and also a similar game called H1Z1 have region locking and it makes the game run nice and smooth PLEASE REGION LOCK
I was about to get my 5th win but when it was me and one other guy left i shot him with my maxed out vector and my framerate went from 90   0 instantly showing me a lovely frame of the other playing ending my players life as I watch helplessly even in the replay my character lagged This game likes to rubberband and frame drop at the worst times be cautious of that when buying this game
i swear everyone who kills me is a hacker1010
Horrible optimization
This game had such potential but with the lack of optimisation poor rego and blatent hackers this game has gone to shThe new map is a boring snipercamp fest Server drop outs   the influx of players from other regions makes this game difficult to play for more than a few rounds before giving up Bluehole made a fortune from this and have barely made an effort to deliver us a game worthy of full release what a slap in the face  I wont be buying another game from this company again and i can t wait for another battle royal game to come out and take Bluehole s place
I uninstalled this game after 430hrs It use to be good then the hacking was terrible and made the game unplayable for a while then it got better and finally the hacking is making it unplayable again I m done with playing a game that the developers refuse to fix because banning accounts just generates more game sales instead of region locking or any of the other simple solutions that would fix the issues
After some time it becomes too boringYou don t something new to do
Best shooter I have played in a long time
Totally regret buying this game Ive given it plenty of chances and it has its moments where its fun with friends but those moments are very few If you like spending time collecting items and then instantly dying from someone sitting in a corner of a bathroom then this games for you If you like shooting 30 rounds at one person before they die  if your hits even register then this game might be for you If you actually think this is a good game you probably ate glue in elementary school and jerk it to hentai
this game sucks and the devs dont have a clue
BEST GAME OF THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YEAR IT s LIT
I want to like this game but the only time I can stomach to play it is with friends The game as a whole is a clunky pieace of junk I have played it from the first day it has come out and the new guns they have added are never really used unless its early game In addition to this the newest map feels poorly done with everything just kinda randomly placed I would rate it similar to Dayz but I have had a better time playing that than this game O yeah the Tick rate is trash I would give this game a 510 Don t buy this
Pretty good game hook up with some friends and you will have a really good timebtw the voicechat trolling is why i rate positive xd
play this game first don t trust the review too much
awesome veri good gaem i like yes recommend very good ok pls buy i like and i want to play this and it is good game and yes ok goodbye
This game was amazing during early access but now it s overrun with hackers
Shum bole
FOR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE S SAKE BLUE HOLE WHERE IN THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  IS YOUR ANTI CHEAT SYSTEM HACKERS EVERYWHERE  We have implemented a new anti cheat system  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE TWhy not hardware ban or IP ban these cheaters Blizzard can do it why can t you  Oh yeah You re too scared to lose moneyPfffft
Great game i recommend you buy it if you have good enough specs to run the game
Its a great battle royale I love the fact that there are different maps to choose from and lots of different guns I dont think i ll stop playing this game any time soon
Trash This game has actually gotten worse from when I started playing it around DECEMBER The developers are just riding out this cash cow until it dies out They put in useless emotes crates and skins instead of actually making the game run better Hacks hits clearly don t register disconnects and crashes regulary as well and sometimes I don t even load in until the plane drops me Overall low quality game that should no longer be paid for would be good if it had actual developers not  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Studios 
rubbish game full of cheaters the mobile verison is much better and works better
This is the opioid of games  You try it once and you hate it but you get hooked and can t stop playing it
SOOO i have played this game a loti have found in the beginning it was a pretty good battle royale game with standard featuresstart in lobby drop from planego into building under fire find any weapon or notget killed or kill run around find better lootget killed by no recoil cheat or chinese type hacker rinse repeatthat about sums it up but it is a good thrilling game  also motorcycles there is some real laughs therethe BIG downside and i mean BIg is the cheats they are actually destroying this gamei still recommend the game but seriously the cheats are getting terrible every gamei mean EVERY game you will find onebe warned
This is a great game but Chinese hackers and cheaters are ruining this game hard The real problem however is that the developer don t do anything with them
Its a great game that has managed to keep me playing since i purchased it but it still has the same issues of hackers that have been spreading through the game like ratsEven with the recent update that was supposed to reduce hackers has barely made a differance as seen when players are sliding across the ground while moving as fast as a car clearly showing off their hacks before the match even starts with plenty of  them reaching the leaderboards with insane kd s and honestly makes it feel like the last update was purely to block things that shouldent make much of a differance like removing game share which still shows the person who owns the game and can still be banned if they get reported for hackingI would honestly love to say this game is worth buying but when 13 of your games have a chance to have hackers it really makes it feel pointless unless you like being killed by the flash or headshot from the other side of the map from some dude who shoots straight up into the airAnd one other thing                                    
Cant even play my own LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing region because it thinks im in asia when im in QLD Australia
Lol this game is such a buggy piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Freezes half the time kicks you out of games friends don t show they are online Box drops are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but for some reason I keep playing it Maybe one day it ll actually be a completed game
Cheating Problems I wont be returning until the dev gets ahold of its game before it runs away from them Especailly with better options like Hunt Showdown coming
Despite the game not being very well optimized it s still quite fun Definitely would recommend
Thanks for refund  
Fun and addictive game but honestly until they region lock china and optimize the fully released game its gonna be a terror for newcommers
don t bother wasting your money on this trash game hackers in nearly every single game and the creator called his western playerbase a bunch of  xenophobes  when asking for region locksave your 30 and buy something else
Mixed feelings The game concept is simple and brilliant But the game has big issues that are ruining the gameNetcode is one issue which has gotten much better during the last couple of months though it still has a ways to goThe most severe problem is cheaters In the last month I cannot count on my hand how many times I have been shot by a player with a Chinese sounding alias who have used some kind of hack which allows them to shoot players kilometers away seemingly without even aiming in the right directionThe developers often makes public statements about so and so many cheaters banned in the last months but their efforts are obviously not enough since the cheaters are rampant and to me the problem seems to get only worse The developers say they have developed new and smart techniques to identify cheaters and they are probably spending lots of time and money to fight the cheaters They are trying and failing to find a very complicated solution to what many fans believe is a problem with a simple and instant solution  Region lock the servers from which the cheating problem mainly emanates ie China This might sound unfair to all those legit Chinese players that are out there But consider this A game like this needs quick responses and fast reflexes High ping messes with the response times when players from different continents meet  Usually you do best if you play in that same region that you are living All those legit Chinese players are probably playing on Chinese servers I mean why wouldnt they So I dont believe a region lock would limit the game in any meaningful way but only bring positive consequences such as lower ping and blocking the cheaters from further ruining the game experience
Fun game until you realize  hit detection is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE T you have to  lead  people at 50 100 meters which is TOTAL LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE T you get wall hacked or aim botted you play duo for hours and dont get a partner that speaks english or you dont get a partner period you shoot someone twice full pattern with over under shotgun 5 feet away and they dont die the building you enter has no loot spawned but the guy next door got M4 level 3 helmet and armor ect ect GTA IV multiplayer has better physics and graphics and it was for xbox 360
Fix your game Blowhole Cheaters everywhere and you dont give a FUpdated  Came back after a few months to see if theres any change First game   wall hacked from the other side of the map   RIP this game
BUG of the year Cheater every games What a game Never experienced such  good  game
1Boring2Servers are too busywait a minute
This game is freaking fun especially with friends the biggest flaw 100  they use a crate and key system they can go die for that especially since they said they had no intentions on doing that otherwise though a lot of fun
Time  while playing this GameTill you face some annoying Bugs and Hackers
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  rng LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  developers LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  gamemodes LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME
overall good fun and enjoyable but it crashes alot and messed my 500gb drive up so i have to boot windows with other drive
Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hit registration
If you like cheating this is the game for you
This is my first review ever and it is with a heavy and vengeful heart that I write it  Firstly I love this game so much however I must write a negative review for the language barriers put into this game  I have had this game for 3 days and of all the games i ve played on the NA server i ve had 3 natural english speakers and about  a dozen with acceptable english  These numbers do not include the overwhelming amount of asian players on the NA server that do not speak any english  Communication is so key when playing duo and squad the the experience is extremely frustrating and saps all fun of the game trying to overcome the language barrier  There needs to be a language setting so that all languages will only be matched up with partners they can understand  Again this negative review has nothing to do with gameplay its addicting and thorougly fun when you aren t overwhelmed with the asian people going nuts in thier language  Even if there was an option to mute teamates that are annoying as hell for speaking in a different language would make me change to this review but you can only mute all of them or none of them and that defeats the purpose of voice communication in the first place
LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN CS GO
I have spent more then 500 hours in this game i bought it almost immediatelly after it has gone out so it means in early access and all i can say is that this game has so many irregularities that should not have been here after so much cash that they earned I decided to wait and wait and wait but all they can fix i guess is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing breathing animation and I am sick of this I really like the concept of this game and practically new genre that this game created but i feel like developers are not working as hard as they should first of all so many bugs and second I feel like weapons and hit points they take and how they react on armor and helmet are a total LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t on paper everything looks fine but in game everything is mixed and the only thing that you can be sure is that you will not die if you don t get hit by anything and that is a damn shame So if you want to rage from time time this is the game you WANT to buy And after so much time i still want this game to succeed and fix so many of the big bugs and things that needs to be fixed so that we can all enjoy game that we payed for but This will probably not happen They are not listening for community and it will be their end It is probably another case that we saw where some game company pulled big money on it and bailed after some timeI will continue playing this game probably and still hope for the best beacuse this game has great potential but i need a longer pause starting todayTy for reading and hope that you see my words are true after you spend some time in this game
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bug everywhere
Really awesome
BEST 7 ticks game so farCan listen to free Chinese cool rap music all you need is just holding T and say out loud  Cao ni ma  aka your mother is handsomecan get random head shot by random guy in Chinese name eventhough when watching replay he was hunting birds in the skyover all 88 nothing to complain
awsome game huge map great gunplay awesome solo or team play
Game itself is gooddeveloper doesnt give a flying LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about the hacking Sooooo much talk about anti cheatno results
COMING SOON

If u tired of being tryhard in the gta online then this one is the best game you will experienced
Can t find minecraft hunger games on steam help
1 YEAR AFTER I BOUGHT THIS GAMEAND STILLHACKERSSTILLUNSTABLE PERFORMANCE STILL GLITCHESSTILL UPDATESSTILL LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  AIMING DUE TO LAGSTILL A BETA VERSIONTHANK YOU PU FOR STEALING 30 EUROS FROM EVERYONE HERE FOR A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME
This is awful It s been out for so long yet it s the buggiest game I have in my library I can t even get into a match The start screen is completely broken You d think with Fortnite pretty much taking their entire player base they d care about getting this game up to par
Either land and die in 5 minutes from a guy locked himself in a bathroom with a shotgun or loot for 20 minutes and die from a AKM or Kar98k  with no scope from the other side of the mountain by a Chinese using hacksRIP this game
Okay I would give this game a good review but honestly The game is loosing its sh t The new map is not well optimized And this is my opinion What they SHOULD do is to REIGON lock China Holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I cant count how many times I been encountering people who are from China LAGGY AF Put your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together PUBG Corp or BlueHole whatever you are called Until then please do not buy this game until this game gets it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together You CAN get it Im not stopping you but you are NOT going to have a good time Sticking with Fortnite for a while
Cannot recommend this game at this timeToo many hackers
region lock china end of story
This game rapes you again again and again  And then you realize you need to get off and get at least something good out of it
The Worst Netcode and  Hit Registry ive ever seen on your screen you hit the enemy like 6 times and in replay only 2 times where he ofc shot first and win the duelRandom Shotguns lvl 3 Gear doesnt matter you can get oneshotted by a Double Barrel Shotgun most random weapon in this gameBut most likely you land with some other people trying to find a gun after 3 Looted Apartments you fight with a pistol level1 helmet level 2 vest vs full equiped pplREMOVE Pistols and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING T SHIRTS from the game and Add ALOT more Guns to the loottableSpeedhacker aimhaxx or instant heals  are aviableCant recommend this game at all will swap to ION as soon as Possible
Don t buy this game if you expect smooth performance The concept of the game is good and interesting but as with everything in this world it could get boring after a while and what then  It really sucks when you have to play on the lowest possible settings to even get an adequate FPS rate and even then with all the FPS dops it sucks so much Cheaters I won t get into that
This game is the best 
Bluehold is so useless Trash update When they update there always have some problem wih it
Pues el juego va en buena direccion mejor que cuando empezohan puesto la eleccion de mapa han metido un mapa mas pequeo que ahorra el aburrimiento de esperar hasta que pase algo como ocurria en los otros mapas y han aadido una skin para el paracaidas que aunque parezca una LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ada se llevaba pidiendo desde hace siglos espero que siga asi y aver si arreglan los bugs que les quedan que son menos de los que habia inicialmente
The game is not recomended for countries like India which have such terrible Internet Connection Lag is a common occurence and most players take advantage of this to get kills
Region Lock china please TOOOOOO MANY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING CHEATER IN NA SERVERS PLAY THE GAME FAIR
Hackers Hacker Hackers Hackers Hackers BAN CHINA
create different server for chinese
Has its ups and downs but overall enjoy this game
Awesome game very alike H1Z1 and like that one it starts to get boring but with so much updates the game never get s old
 Update  Changed from Down vote to an Up vote There is significantly less cheating mods   not sure why   specifically when you play first person only mode  FPP This mode is much more fair and I have seen less cheating Much less My deaths have been reasonably fair which makes me feel a lot better about the direction of the game development This game would be super fun if it weren t for the fact that 7 out of 10 times I am killed it s by a person who is cheating and doesn t even have to target me correctly They just barely have me in their scope and they can shoot anywhere and I die I was killed with a headshot while I was driving a truck the person was aimed behind me not in front of my direction of travel and they were 1000m away Boom headshot These people suck at this game and they are  winning  Pathetic I bet they can t keep a job because they have to actually earn a living Until The cheating clears up I can t say I suggest playing this game Right now it might as well be called  Player Unknown s Run for 30 minutes then die 
Bluehole is a lazy LOVE LOVE LOVE  companie thats just milking our money
Died to someone I did not seeDied to hackersDied to a parachuteDied to a bad nadeDied to the zoneDied to falling
Not bad The physics seem a little wonky but a fun game nevertheless Learning curve is pretty steep I have died an awful lot of stupid ways Like exiting a car when not at full stop   falling damage will kill you Hopping through a window seems to be a matter of timing Stuck on objects many times You have to press reload manually Shot in the back many times while trying to get vaulting rightThere is a lot of room for improvement but I would say it s worth the 30 bucks Wait for a sale if you are not sure wether to buy it now Hopefully the devs will fix a few bugs until then Most likely they will not care because they have made their fortune already  700 million a month but there is hope   
 downloads PUBG installs the game with excitement looks at the region  EUROPE  goes into team matched session chinese people heavybreathing in internet cafs they ask me if i speak chinese quits to lobby and tries to find a team match without chinese people infestating the european servers gives up and uninstalls the game

It is a really fun game but once it is completely optimised it will be the best game
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing map LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing mirama LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Chinese
the game has so much potential to be great and fun BUT right now its almost unplayable hackers are running rampant almost always chinese they need to be reigon locked and they need to get rid of the loot and keys sytem hackers literally only paly for the battle points and to sell the crates you get rid of that and you wont have hackers from china who can make more palying pubg and cheating than having a real job in a sweatshop factory making pennies a day
i liek dis
Too many hackers
Sort out your game servers you have millions of dollars so fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server problem pay money for a game you cant even play
Ran by cheaters and they support it They claim the have banned 3 million so far but not permantly Meaning they can buy the game again So Bh makes 2x the money They refuse to region lock The refuse to optimize or improve There just soaking up money for a tired hacker riddled game
The auto aim and no recoil features works great Good Job
Cheaters cheaters everywhere
Region lock china Tony Ma
fk this game love it

Developer keeps adding new content instead of fixing major bugs or the stability in general random landing after parachute  getting damage in 810 cases  due to bad programming hitting someone with melee weapons is completely random  due to bad programming items spawn up to 20 seconds after landing  due to bad programming  servers you can oneshot people from 100 meters with a shotgun or deal 10 hitpoints from 1 meter mostly luck based completely braindead early game mechanics  Instantly find a weapon or die Therefore you need to start about 5 rounds to get into the game or just drop at a location where nobody drops and be bored to death players  steps relatively quiet compared to other sounds but very important for locating enemies so max out volume until your ears bleed or play with handicap  no rewards for kills exept loot and no anti camping mechanic That means killing is fun but wont get you any advantage You will more likely pull attention and get ambushed from behind   For winning the game just go afk for about 30 minutes and kill the last guyExtras  much less BP in Duo  Squad than in solo WHY  you can t choose the map you want to playQuality by PUBG Corporation
The developers don t deserve this player baseOver hyped garbage Rushed out of early access
This game is like a drug At first it seems all great You drop Stalber get some kills and have fun But then over time the dopamine hits become smaller and smaller due to the games time spacing At this point the game has become unrewarding and just plain unfun You often spend most of your time walking and then you suddenly get killed by some random sniper which you couldn t do anything about Even when you do do well then some china player with 600 ping kills you through a wall
Definitely one of the most fun experiences in a video game I ve ever had Unfortunately you need a spendy PC to run this at above 120fps I feel the only problems I have with this game is extreme lack of loot in non high traffic areas clutter among the dessert map as far as unnecessary buildings and taking plenty of fall damage when I parachute in
This game has the potential to be fun but the creators don t seem to take any advice from the vast amoutn of critical review they ve had Playing with people on the other side of the world would be neat if physics didn t apply to the internet and data rate exchange but they do Region lock is still missingOn top of that the game is just poorly made in general I didn t play when the game was in beta but I honestly thought it still was because it s poorly constructed I have a 3500 gaming rig that never crashes except when playing this game Once every time I play my entire computer will crash always at a critical moment and the game will freeze at least every gameThe developers need to do serious work on this for how much they re charging
If you want to lose braincells and have blood vessels spontaneously combust then this game is for you
It is what it is It has issues bugs sometimes crashes But it still is very enjoyable to play when I just want to let out some steam
Fcking sht game The WORST SERVERS human kind has ever seen MOST CHEATERS the gaming community has ever seen HIT REG not even once F u ck this garbage
Great potential but cheaters are ruining the gameif they keep ignoring this huge problem this game is gonna die in 2 3 months RegionLockCHINA
You know its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up when people feel the need to start a petition on changeorg https wwwchangeorgpbluehole region lock china on pubg    doubt it will do anything the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  heads at PUBG corp and BLULOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  are enjoying rolling in all that chinese cash

MMP118TX
Sick game South African servers would make it even betterWink wink nudge nudge
This game is filled with bugs and is no where near a good game Sure its fun for the first 200 hours then after you just see everything that is wrong with it I dont mean the battle royale style whoever gets lucky and finds a gun first wins i just mean all the bugs in the game itself and it will just annoy you to the point of thinking  do i even want to play this anymore  I was a top 5000 1  player for awhile so id like to think im decent at the games knowledge
It s a great running and looting simulator If you re lucky you ll spend 20m running from circle to circle gathering all the precious equipment Once you re stocked and ready for combat you ll plan your next move to post up in a nice two story building in the middle of the next circle Playing smart you ve decided to hug the zone to the north because it was a southern cut and the probability of running into a group is low As you re running up the hill you hear gun fire to the south which means everything is going as planned The blue zone closes behind you and the new zone is revealed Perfect Your desired two story location is going to be great You start to run POW health is low In the comming seconds as you are processing what is happening POW dead Watching the replay you notice that an outstanding sniper with a few ticks of health is sitting deep in the blue zone You had no chance and neither did he  Well Guess I ll queue up again This time it ll be different
Between the crashing black screens sound bugs hit marker bugs not loading player models and defaulting to Asian servers the publishers must recognise  optimization  as a chinese word cause they do not acknowledge the chinese presence and the flooding of cheating hacking and overall bs that is causing this game to dive fast to the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  2 bin at Wal mart
Two months after release and this game is still broken It doesn t seem like Bluehole has any idea what s going on Constant updates and patches and cheating is still rampant Guns don t load in the map for 20 plus seconds every game Items don t get picked up when you want shooting through raillings and fences is bugged beyond belief Bullets ignor armor Driving any vehicle on even a flat surface is riskier than running into direct fire as the slightest bump sends you in an end over end death roll or just outright explodes your vehicle There are more funny moments and bug videos on youtube about this game than I can count Bluehole has resulted to greed and thus not delivering where they promised 1010 WILL play the next battle royal game with similar feelgraphics that is made by a REAL developer Screw you bluehole
Cheaters are really making this game a frustrating experience
Probably one of the full games I ll buy full price After 350 hours I ve probably made it all back and then some selling crates anyway Free game GG
This game is really great to play in co op and even solo The main problem right now I m seeing are the cheaters If you loot well and move quietly through the round you can be one of the 10 at the finals but be carefull 70  of the people who left in the finals are cheaters So don t be mad if a guy walk directly to your spo0 and throw a grenade he needs it for his life you don tI feel really great when I see a cheater because I know there are people worst than me   There is no   vote so for the cheaters I will hit the  No  sorry
Horribly optimized for older AMD CPU s
It s a best game Buy now
Region Lock China You admitted that they re the majority of cheaters in the game
While difficult to get good and you get the occassional hacker it s still a great game Really fun with friends and MUCH better than fortnite WHICH SUCKS
this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  recomend not to buy only bad map playing
This game should change name from PUBG to be CUBG  Cheater Unknown s BattleGround
 DDDD
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game alright
Very good game 
Hackers everywhere
Pfft Stupid game
Pretty good idea  nice graphics and fun game to play with friends BUT1 Crappy server ticks  getting shot even if you think you got cover just because of the desync2 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimisation3 Many cheaters ruining it  although there s no reason to cheat you don t get anything from wining anyways4 If you want to go fighting from the begining  droping on  hot spots  it s pure RNG many times you don t get a gun and just die  also on late game pure RNG if the circle gives you good position easy to win  otherwise you re LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE edI WOULD recommend this game if it gets fixed  steady 30 40 tickrate optimisation more balanced loot drops and dealing with the  cheaters are a must  if they don t get fixed within 6 months 1 year this gonna be a dead game 100 
you make me sick thinking you own a Genre go die im sad i bought this game now
A company that would rather spend its money suing others than work on their damn game  This is a sinking ship
 Still a buggy piece of lazy trash
I just don t like it  D
its so bad
Play game get destroyed by Chinese hacker at vital momentTry to check replay of game to spectate said hackerGame crashesSend error reportError reporter crashes Every timeWhat a quality piece of software this is Totally worth 30   Go around looting by myself don t encounter anyone face to faceGo to group of houses that should be unoccupiedHear footsteps inside see barrel of gun phasing through wallAttempt to throw grenade through open boards placed over a window with no glassGrenade bounces back and kills me That sure makes sense   Driving the motorbike with the sidecar is literally impossible Take it out   Miramar sucks majority of community agreesDevs  let s give it like 2  more coverCommunity  How about just scrap it Devs      guys stop you re hurting our feelings we worked hard on thatTake it out   Majority of community outcries  Region Lock China PU  I dont think thats a good idea at allCommunity  WE DO   Start a new game start doing really wellCatch an airdrop mow down people with GrozaMake it to top 3 kill only known enemy nearbyFinal circle nothing is happeningDie to blue zone because NO ONE ELSE WAS IN THE MATCHGET 2ND PLACEBluehole literally and digitally ripped me off                          I don t wanna tell you to spend money on this game I really don t But I have had some good fun with it The game as a game is really really fun and has a lot of nice things to it The game as an entity of software and product is a pile of trashPlaying with Chinese players on North America servers literally 247 is annoying Hackers are running wild no matter what The rewards system is broken the odds of getting anything decent is nearly impossible Driving through a pile of hay is like driving into a brick wall Your vehicle can explode on you at any moment for no apparent reason The Vector has a tiny LOVE LOVE LOVE  magazine it s useless without an extended mag  the real life Vector uses Glock mags in game they should be using pistol mags Inserting a magazine into your weapon doesn t count as reloading until the animation finishesAll this to say this game should not be worth 30 It should not be officially released right now It is not complete and their focus should not be toward making this game ready for e sports But is it fun  Can be like 60  of the time
Great game The full battle royale experience and realistic  for the most part You can play by yourself or have more fun with your friends
Great concept but overall a poorly developed game when i first played this i thought it was very poorly developed about a year later after all the  bug fixes  I still think it s poorly developed I would advise against buying this game unless it were to be sold to another dev to enhance Until then it should be avoided Too many months of waiting so much money invested and yet almost no real results They spent so much time working on a new map when they should ve been fixing their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers and fixing bugs
To many bugs sometimes its not rendering the map always i meet some glithes or bugs in matches if you want a better game and free download fortnite 30 BUCKS FOR THIS GAME  ITS TO MUCH BETTER WAS IF IT WAS 5 BUCKSThe single  in this game are the graphics  my opinnion
  
REGION LOCK ASIA this game is bs when you have lagging bloody asians constantly coming into the oc servers i had one game where half the damn players where asianit s becoming a bloody joke region lock them im happy if i dont get to play on their servers just lock it so they cant come and use their bs lagg against us

the game is great in general so far i have not  atleast i think so come across any hackerPS playing on european server
I overall enjoy the time i put in this game Althiugh it needs region lock the core of the game and the style is very good It will probably entertain you for hours The thrilling and intense moments of when you are being shot at or are in an intense gun fight with your friends is just something you cannot find in other battle royale games like fortnite battle royale  which i do personally enjoy  Although teh pros and cons of the game it is all up to consumer prefrenceI will now move onto the cons of the game I usually dont have glitches like this very often but sometimes after parachuting and landing you will be stuck in the ground You are still able too move but very slowly Jumping up and down or through windows dosent help either Another glitch that I incountered only once This glitch is when I jumped through a window of a small building I saw a SCAR L on the other side The game did the jumping through window animation but then suddenly my character fell over and died The game said   You died from falling 
This game is great but then at the same time it is Trash The owners of the game need to stop being cheap How are they making millioins of dallors on a game but yet theyre severs are supper trash I never played a game that ive lagged out so many times Game is TRASH
The premise of the game was great I wasted about a 1000 hours on it so I can t downright not recommend it Instead I have a mixed opinion of this game It s really fun for the first 300 500 hours depending on your patience level but then it becomes a grind once you realize that you re playing a game based on headshot accuracyloot and less on tactical wit It becomes more like Counter Strike and less of what most people started playing it as in the first place a somewhat open world realistic shooter with some tactical elements Now it s basically an open world arcadeAlso the lagnetcode became unbearable I ve stopped playing because of it Most fights became RNG shoot outs There have been many engagements where both my opponent and myself should have killed each other at the same time yet since the game picks and chooses what shots register it instead becomes RNG in close quarters combat Give it a few days of playing and you ll see plenty of times where you ll see blood register on yourself or the player and the game won t count it as a damage because God forbid if both top 2 players killed each other in the final circle and no one got a chicken dinner Instead the game chooses what shots count and which ones don t to avoid a mutual As for people who might be confused on why I m not recommending this game when I obviously got my money s worth from a 1000 hours of entertainment  adding my hours on the test server I only played this because I didn t bother exploring what other content was available  It s very similar to when someone keeps going back to an old ex  not because they enjoy their time together but because they don t instead put in the effort to find someone new more exciting and ultimately better for them Simply put this game became a simplistic no thought boredom time killer TLDR  PUBG is the Bud Light of games Gets the job done nothing special nothing too bad This game is great for a couple hundred hours until you learn the maps and learn the exploits Then it becomes a mindless time killer which is great if you can t be bothered to find anything with stimulating above mediocre content
Just another Mario Party clone
was a fantastic game when it was released my squad and my self  played for hrs after getting out of work we actually stopped playing other games and dedicated all of our free time to this i have 21 chicken dinners so its not like i suck or im horrible the problem is after all of the so called updates to make the game better they have actually destroyed the game with no region lock or trying to pick up weapons and your vigorously tapping the f button to grab the weapon and ammo then nothing happens you hear the foot steps getting closer so your hitting the button 2x faster but just as it works someone rocks and shocks the door off the hinges to put one shotgun bullet into your head not a big deal  EARLY RELEASE  rightright WRONG blue hole and the devs have destroyed the game like let me give you an example it was my turn i was the top dog on the drop in i open the door chase someone down with the shotty he turns around after i have shot him point blank in the head twice and the guy 1 shots me to the face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
i love this game but there s only like two or three maps please make more and dont be afraid of a little diversity
Trash game from a trash developer If you are a masochist and love to bring mental pain to yourself then this is the game for you It is not optimized even slightly lags are horrible loot is so hard to get it feels like I m playing some grindy MMO and most of all a lot of hackers Death cam crashes and game crashes every so often you just want to deinstall this garbage of a game Overall a bad experience and would not recommend it to anyone Not worth 30 euros not even 10 If you want a quality game then go and play Fortnite More skill based game then this campy boring slow LOVE LOVE LOVE  game and most of all its free DO NOT BUY
this game need a lot of fixKeep crashing at loading screen Not worth money

i Have a problem that saying it has missing dll how to fix this pleasee 
Too many Chinese
fUN TO PLAY ITS GETTING BETTER WITH ITS LAGGGGG
Playing this game since Beta After release has double the bugs had when in beta Too bad
Get ready for countless hours of playing this game
Cheating has been handled far better than what it was in the past which is why I changed my recommendation  Overall a fun game however I would not consider a  full  release  Still too many bugs and not enough updating to keep things interesting
PUBG is one of the most thrilling games I have ever playedThe hit registry and driving mechanics may be buggy from time to time but the expirience is truly unique
Everything is great but mercy just ruins the game I know you re a very busy man Jeff but please just listen to the community and nerf her

Love this game but can t recommend till the hacker issue is solved It s next to unplayable because everygame you run into tons of hackers if you want to win you ll have to beat most of them which makes the game just a joke  Thumbs down until the developers try at least to fix this too bad it doesn t look like it s happening anytime soon Go play Fortnite instead it s better and it s free
Useless game
Hacker Infested POS
Greedy game no trade  skin   Bad port xbox   What is wrong buddy

Probably one of the worst games I ve played in a while I can understand everyone who finds this to be a fun engaging experience and a blast to play either alone or with friends I really do but this simply isn t for me There is an incredibly steep learning curve that some of you may bypass if you have played competitive shooters like CS before but for those who have limited experience with such not so forgiving games and came in expecting an entertaining fun shooter with 100 other players on a map in a fight to the death  the game is much more than that but you may not necessarily find that a good thingIt takes a lot of time and effort to get used to the game s gunplay and mechanics its quirky bugs and glitches as well as learn adapt and take advantage of the general player mentality all of which are skills I don t have the time or inclination to develop Personally I didn t find it fun to run halfway across the map to avoid the blue only to lose half my health to it and then get shot by a player on the other side of the field who I didn t even know existed It wasn t fun for me to get knocked out after my teammate hit a rock while driving but the rest of the group went on unscathed It wasn t fun to empty my entire clip into an unsuspecting player s back only for him to turn around while I was reloading and kill me with 3 shots and neither was it fun to fire a double barrel shotgun into an enemy s helmetless face yet have him survive and headshot me later in the fight while I was turning a corner with my head well behind cover When watching the death cam it turned out my hits didn t register on his player model but his did on mine Perhaps I ve unknowingly survived other firefights for the same reason and caused my enemies that same frustration tooIt can be a very fun experience if you re playing with a squad for a bit of a laugh and random time pass but if you re playing alone the first few hours in game can be extremely frustrating and difficult no matter how many guides you ve read or tutorials you ve watched before purchasingIn short this game just isn t for me I m more of a casual gamer who doesn t like being frustrated at video games  believe me no matter how good you are this will happen a lot the one thing I enjoy above all else in the world or being put into stressful situations or having to spend several hours understanding the intricacies of the game If you are or you genuinely find this game fun good for you   I m happy you found more entertainment in this than I did but if you re anything like me don t bother shelling out 30 bucks for this experience just to jump on the latest bandwagon of internet trendsAnd for those of you that will simply respond to this with  you re just bad at the game  or  you just don t understand how to play  or  you just haven t played enough to get why this is fun  well done Well done for contributing exactly nothing to the post I m not complaining or insulting anything or anyone simply explaining why I didn t find this experience fun I know I m bad at the game and that I haven t had enough time within the game s world to understand all the mechanics and develop a solid playstyle to get better I know that it was a bad decision on my part to not do enough research before purchasing No secret in that but if you need to dispute my own opinions in order to consolidate your own you re only proving how insecure you are I will continue playing with friends because it occasionally is funny to watch glitches in action and as a means to hang out with each other but not otherwiseI didn t make this review to insult the game and its devs or use the game s numerous performance and security issues to excuse my ineptitude at playing well I fully understand and respect the opinions of anyone who enjoys PUBG in any manner but I just want to prevent anyone like me from making a poor purchase due to lack of research
If you like running around picking up LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for 20 minutes and getting shot then this game is going to entertain you
I can t be bothered to play something that isn t finished I ll be back when this game is 100  complete RegionLockChina  
Loading screen and Running SimulatorSteam community believe everything you heard about this game from your friends It is absolutely true This is THE loading screen and running simulator for our generation I bought this game in early access and didnt really play it until it finally went 10 and I can not believe what I ve been missing Every single game this week has started with the exhilarating Loading Screen will the game start  Will it keep loading forever  How many times do I have to CtrlAltDlt and close the program and restart it before I return to find myself either parachuting at the furthest possible corner of the map or load just in time to see my naked body beaten to death by a player in their underwear bearing a crowbar I ll tell you this Is A Mystery I haven t felt this much suspense since waiting for Michigan s electoral college votes to report in during the 2016 election I m with HERAnd the precious few times your character loads BEFORE it is murdered AND teabagged that s when the real fun begins You see this white circle controls the entire game  Racist Nine times out of ten it spawns on the complete other side of the map from where the plane ejects you Let me tell you this map is HUGE So then you get to crawl around find a motorcycle helmet and an UZI  which you can put a scope on and then sprint for like 8 10 minutes It s the most realistic sprinting I ve ever seen its totally like you re there in the game running from some giant blue wall of death into the safety of the white circle  Racist all the while chugging energy drinks to stay alive And I know what you re thinking  I heard this game has vehicles too  It DOES There are tons of vehicles You can usually find them charging at you full speed while you are in the middle of an empty field or desert sometimes you can even drive them for as many as 15 seconds before they flip and run out of gas Talk about a thrill ride And hilarity ensues if you try to eject from the vehicle at anything other than 1mph Don t take my word for it see for yourselfFinally when I thought this game couldn t get any better Bluehole does what the community always wanted added Microtransactions You used to be able to spend your in game points towards nifty free accessories for your character but now I GET TO BUY the ability to open the crate too 250 for a key to unlock the chests that used to be free during early access all in the extremely slim chance that I get something cool like a jacket or bandana WHERE DO I SIGN UP  Some people in the community aren t all that happy that the apparently 80  locked crate drop rate sometimes has a 20  chance to give a free accessory but I say don t you let those poor sports ruin your funSo without going any further I ll leave this review with the following recommendation If you like  black loading screens watching your character be beaten running for minutes at a time camping  no smores wacky vehicle controls white circles and blue walls and most importantly MICROTRANSACTIONS then PUBG is the game that perfected the Battle Royale game style PUBG will have the community playing constantly until the first better game comes out 1010 for microtransactions

ban my accountThe real cheater is not caught07KD70KDThe low ranking user who killed seven people in ten games was more like a cheater than high ranking user who kill seven people in every gameI don t understand why your cheating detection system is so useless In your reply to my complaint you have decisively rejected my request for a re examination of cheatingYou didn t explain to me why my account would be bannedbut it tells me that your test won t go wrongyou even provide no solutionI don t know why your useless cheating detection system will give you so much confidence Are you a real game companyWhy are you so overbearing Dare you release the list of banned accounts I bet many accounts have been wrongly banned
I throughly enjoy this game Nothing is more satisfying than beating someone with your fists and winning If you like PVP and looting then this is for you Yes there are hackers however I have only encountered maybe two on the NA sever 1010 Would fist again
FULL OF CHINA HACKERS
Pros   Devs really optimized the game since I purchased the game  3 Jul 2017 back then I couldn t even properly shoot due to random fps drops  Really fun to play squad with friends  Almost no waiting for a match after you press ready you are instantly loading into a new match with other 90 players  New features added like deathcam so you can actually see why you died  Recently ReShade has been banned from this game so no more filthy cheatersCons   but chinese cheaters are still a thing I love getting killed with headshot from s12k from 400m away  with no aiming note  its just small example in most cases player s crosshair simply snaps back and forth to your head or your body even if that person is not even aiming at you   Even if I said optimization is way better than it was in early access it still could be improved especially in squad mode
gunfights are fun aslong as the other guy is not screaming  CHINA NUMBA ONE  and one shotting you with an AKM From 1006 KM s away also we need to build a region lock and make china pay for it
game is good but optimization is too bad
Wow full released game and I cant even use the lobby oh finally get into his lobby then hes LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing invisible probaby worth 40 bucks though when Fortnites lobbies work for free
Very good game it s easy to learn and really realistic compared to other shooter games xD
UPDATE UPDATE UPDATEUPDATE UPDATE UPDATEWTF 
it s a very good game with realastic mechanics and awesome gameplay replay s are nice and detailedbut the game is about last 20 person the rest is boaring and painfulafter last 20 the real game starts and u can feel the adrenaline moving thro ur vains So yes i recommend it please do Mind that for this game to run smoothly u need a very Good PC otherwise it s all about lagi m using gtx 1060 and a SSD to run it properlyidk  it seems the developers don t know how to work with unity and make the game smoother
It was fun until this point Too many hackers The PUBG Company doesn t care sh  
I strongly recommend against purchasing this gameThis game is filled with people who use aim bots and can shoot you from across the map through the ground and it doesn t matter what servers you play in It s absolutely ridiculousThe last patch was supposedly to add an anti cheat software  or improve the already existing one but it has done absolutely nothing I ll give it a 210 because I actually enjoyed it before it became infected with cheaters
God game but you need a good computer to run
Okay so I have been playing this game for quite some time now im a rather patient person and I have been having some serious high hopes that this games developers would actually do something about the hackers they claim to ban people all the time  big whoop buy a new account and continue hacking 80  of the games I play I get killed by someone through a wall or through trees from a far distance where the shooter never even saw me in the game Ive grown so tired of this problem that I officially regret having ever purchased this game it is finally uninstalled I do NOT advise this game to anyone that hates hackersThen let me start on the optimization of this game I have upgraded my pc to run this game at 100 FPS since then they have some minor optimizing but what they constantly ignore is all the bugs ingame like getting stuck on a wall while trying to land after parachuting or the insane amount of times I was riding a bike launch over a wall then randomly explode while not having taking any vehicle damage or let me not get started on the amount of times that I have gotten stuck in walls or fences you end up floating inside a wall or a fence just because you jumped up against it then you naturally need your mates to come knock you down in hopes that you will fall out of the wall  sometimes this works sometimes and then ofcourse the latest changes to the weapons which has completely ruined the balance of the game UMP s and Vectors are now the strongest weapons in the game purely because they have next to NO recoil what so ever so forget using your assault rifles pick up those tiny little SMG s and go wreck anyone that has not managed to adjust from the assault riflesLong story short I dont advise this game to anyone that expects good development or even if you are expecting some sort of realism to the game there is absolutely nothing realistic about this game I cannot count the amount of times that I have heard jokes about this terrible optimization and the so called physics of the gamemy verdict started off promosing ending up a terribly crap game thats filled with hackers on all servers absolute waste of time
lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag 
Awful game Would like my money back Nothing but chinese hackers faulty deaths and poor game quality congrats on AAA Blueballs Cao ni ma
Gameplay is great Servers are awful Hackers are everywhere I have a lovehate relationship with this game but i honestly cant recommend it
game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  now
Its a pretty good game you land loot for 15 minutes get pushed into the middle get killed and repeat
HALLAW
not launch ready crash conatltybuggy if youre into that then its great game
eSports Ready Frame rate unstable rarely past 120 26 Average tick rate servers Hackers galore Inconsistant variables Unreleased weapon data Ridiculous physics Multimillion dollar company that can t fix simple problems Censorship of outstandingly large outcries  Xenophobic  Regional ping issues forcing you to play foreign servers 
The game is literally trash in terms of softwareCrashes very oftenInsane required hardwareYou have to literally ignore windows errors while you play

Spamming R doesn t reload so you end up dyingA ton I mean a TON of aim hackers and a toxic community
Decent BattleRoyale Its still at least fun for its kind
bad game
RegionLockChina   I am sick of god damn asians on every server with their 200 ping i mean they start shooting before they turn the corner either make it so you can only have a maximum amount of ping before the server kicks you or region lock all areas unless you have friends in the same lobby from that region i know i don t have a lot of hours but i still feel this way despite how long i have played
its ok my dudes
god game recomend buying it has gone through many changes and has become an amazing game 3
This game is full of hackers got to fix that problem
Not worth the buy atm they gave out a game with too many buggs unplayable atm Bugs i am having  always the first match crashes my game and somethimes the computer tooblack screen loading screen somethimes it last 10 seconds after i have landed i rarely dont get them and i mean really rare so i give it a 055
jesus LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing christ all those uppdates
fix ur damn game for christ s sake
It would be a fun game sometimes its nice to troll or play serious but the glitches bugs and performance drops are really annoying It feels that after almost 2 months of updates the game is still in early access Untill atleast half of the current bugs and fps drop issues are fixed I m giving negative review   ALSO REGION LOCK GOD DAMN CHINA 70  playing are chinese ffs
I have played over 500 hours on this game since late november 2017 whilst holding down a full time job and supporting a family All i can say is well done to the creators because i cannot stop playing this game lolvery addictive indeed I have made some good friends through playing the gameA couple of down points are as follows  New map is far to open and unevenThe loot seems to have got alot worseThe VW wagon is pointlessNot being able to choose which map we want to play We should be able to purchase keys for the crates with BP points even if its a large amount  not everyone wants to spend money on buying these things
So I wanted to make 200 hours on the game before posting the reviewTL DR  Don t buy it nowThis game is a hype in its unique genre and suspense The first couple of games I was constantly dying in the blue falling off the cars and cycles being killed out of nowhere Gradually you gain some skill of surviving avoiding and making your time to last longer Finally you get into top 10 and that s where your shooter skills come into play It s entertaining addictive and hilarious It is tremendously fun to play with your mates especially if they are good at shooting  eg CS GO background You get stories to tell you get fun and meme moments   that s pricelessBut after a while you get tired of crashes bugs  blueball is so bad at development chinese teamkilling and hackers It dramatically spoils the fun and you regularly rage quit I d say that 90  of time this game isn t fun at all and you need to invest much time in ads skills before it starts to pay off It s extremely hard to masterI d love to see tutorials sandbox run with easy bots for training and related features that would make this game more loveable For now it s for lovers only and I d rather pass 200 hours ago
Best game ever made The only game to offer repetitive looting of the same item
Not Worth
It is a shameful act to hang on too much as a Chinese
too busy servers errors ect
Noice Game Overall  needs bit Improvement in Stutters 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you for disabling family sharing With family sharing I could easily play on my main account without having to switch accounts all the time Fix your anti cheat detection instead of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing over your regular players
Crashed when I was about to pick up an AWM 100010 would not buy again
why does my game freeze after everygame   This games LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   My review
Great game hours of fun CHINA NUMBER 1 MUDDA FUCA
Amazing game 1010 I highly recomend this game
iz gud
Everytime they update its prime hours for US Servers its infurating and i feel that this game shouldnt have left beta for another few months
The Dark Souls of Fortnite1010
A good game for the cheaters
Pretty meh game Could be fun with friends if you had any
I want my money back
Full of hackers
Killed trading
PUBG
This game gets less stable and more inconsistent with each update I haven t raged as hard since the glory days of APB It s pretty fun
CHINESE IS EVERYWHERE I M SO ANNOYING AND THEY ALWAYS KILL ME IN THE SAME TEAM FOR ANYONE WHO PLAY ALONE OR HAVE NO FRIEND I M NOT RECOMMEND TO PLAY THIS GAME IN SQUAD MODE OR ELSE BECAUSE YOU WILL UPSET LIKE ME
Crashes half the time you start a match after this recent patch Garbage
This game never should have come out of early access The only reason it came out of early access was so that they could sell you loot boxes without any negative feedback Oh by the way you don t get to pick which loot box you want Three of them require keys at 250  per key The fourth is free but you will never really get that one anymore The game is written on terrible coding and no matter how much they patch and polish the game it will never respond the way you want it to Shots do not register you can t pick up items Third party VOIP services to vpice chat which meant to prevent  that is meant prevent cheaters causes people to not be able to use in game voice chat if they have a certain router Most games are spent looking for weapons now because of the spawn system You may find something other than a pistol or shotgun if you are lucky and you live long enough Certainly not a BATTLEGROUND Now lets talk about all the cheaters that play the game Almost the entire community wants them to block a country like most other publishers do However they won t do it because the country in question keeps buying versions of the game and feeding into the greed Long live 2018 for a AAA Battle Royal game
Really great extremely fun game to play with friends except the chinese have taken it over EVERYTIME I play a solo game  literally the last 10 games I either get teamed by chinese working together or more often the person has a highlighting feature where they can see you coming from a mile away Very disappointed seeing how this game has been out forever and it seems that the cheating continues to get worse The only thing this game is known for right know is hacking THATS IT Nothing else But the company refuses to tackle this issue head on It would all be fixed if they just region locked china but Its obvious that they dont care about its players but cares about keeping the money rolling in
Big battlefield player here who s never touched em since getting this game LOVE IT
Full Release what a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing joke
dont buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game this game is not pubg its BUGG
GOAT
This is a great game but it is abysmally coded I just spent several hours trying to fix and repair my computer after this games loading screen caused a major crash on my computer I could not leave tab out force quit or do anything to the loading screen  My computer is fairly new and fairly high end so that is not why Please if you re thinking of buying this game wait until they sort out the overnumerous amount of bugs errors and glitches that this poorly released game hasAlso this was on the new  PUBG 10  meaning it was released as this They still have way too many bugs to fix and should have been put back into betaRecommended in the future if they ever sort out the bugs
This game is actual dog crap On my screen I unload half a magazine into a guy and I die I go back and watch the replay and my guy is just sitting there not even shooting What kind of horse crap LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers are these  The game isn t even registering you shooting anymore Along with a million other bugs and crappy stuff that happens That and the crazy amount of hackers is just putting this game into the dirt
Jump aim for military die do it again skydiving simulator in short
You need anti cheat measures like 6 months ago game was fun until all the hackers and cheaters started using aim bots and killing me from across the map or seeing me threw walls or glitching into rocks Region lock china and get some real mods and servers This is unreal for a  complete  game
I feel that PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS  All Caps for no particular reason started out as a go to for a great mixture of realism teamplay and high adrenaline moments This however slowly gets drowned out by multiple realizations about the actual game itselfPut simply the game although extraordinarily popular is unfinished This is apparant even with multiple updates there are persistent texture and rendering bugs not that it matters because most players intentionally turn the graphic settings down in order to see players better out of an environment The game took several months to add vaulting considering this game is based off of a mod of the ARMA engine I m suprised it took that long The game is rather finnicky at times the loading screen crashing is a regular occurance The game itself is basically the ultimate battle royal style gameplay people want these days with a scavenging and survival element akin to a game like rust but without crafting This mechanic is interesting but ultimately the cards must be in your favor for you to be guaranteed a good game There is a lot of RNG in this game there is some skill but I d say about 80  of this game is based on luck and 20  is based on skill You can learn adapt and try to overcome but that won t matter if you end up with a pistol and the first circle is on the other side of the map I like the approach but it does feel really slanted towards luck and I ve witnessed and experienced nothing to the contrary You will have many frustrating deaths One of my biggest issues with the game is that no death really feels deserved For instance the first killcam I watched when the feature was implemented I was in a house and I crouched to pick up an item and got picked off by a Kar98k Typical death right  I watch the killcam and see some dude sitting on a building turn and snap right to the window I was barely in and headshotted me immediately Clearly a cheater which is a problem I ll discuss later Even discounting the cheating problem the gameplay is rather akward and clunky at times sometimes it feels like the person you re shooting at is sponging 762x39mm rounds and they turn and two tap you with an M16 The outcomes of gunfights feel mostly up to chance especially when they are drawn out for an extended period of time The circle in my opinion cements the fact the gameplay is 80  up to chance I say this because the circle will either save or screw you with little inbetween Oh there happens to be a mountain on the side you re approaching from  Tough There s a river there  Sorry There s a bunker beneath this spot and there are enemies beneath it you can t reach due to the blue sphere of death  Unfortunate The circle is on the other side of the map  Get better at  adjusting to that situation  or something The community is possibly one of the worst I ve ever seen If you want evidence of this look at the formus This game is like GTA Online if everyone was forced in close proximity to kill each other and the community takes this to the max Cheating is very common even with Battleye which I believe with my coding background to be fundamentally flawed and easy to exploit Just check Battleye s twitter in January they banned over 1 million people in that month alone The majority of these players are from china hence why the community is begging for a region lock The developers are hesitant to do this because of all the money they made from sales over there The development team has highs and lows they actually engage the community to their credit but will outright ignore other issues such as the flawed Xbox One Launch  Go to CrowbCat on Youtube and watch the Xbox One Release for PUBG The game in my opinion shouldn t be out in it s current state the game still feels in beta and you can t help but feel the lack of polish even on the newest map In summary I feel that PUBG is a game with a very high ceiling but it has a lot to do to repair several glaring issues that are currently frustrating many players myself included I hope this game is successful but until I see a solution to cheating improvements in the core gameplay itself and more commitment to the community from the dev team I can t say this game is going in a positive directionFinal Rating  4510Rating if my Qualms were Resolved 8510
TRASH GAME
The hame is fun but there is a lot of hackers that are mostly Chinese that Bluehole refuses to region lock Also no matter what server you go on you will almost never have a team of people who speak any language but Chinese I recommend another game at least until they fix the cheater problem and maybe the lag issues Chinese players experience more lag then most due to their enviorment which often times results in you getting to cover successfully but they are lagging so much that they see you for at least another 2 seconds
For real this game is garbage for real might as well play fortnite or h1z1 cause id rather play a game with bugs than a game with dumb LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers from china using hacks I played 2 matches and I can say there where like 16 hackers iv seen already
I loved Dayz this is making Dayz an actual game with no zombies  I love it if you like this type of game you will love it too
GOOD GAME TO RELAX AND NOT WORRY ABOUT STATS  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING UPDATES CAUSE FPS PROBLEM EVERY SINGLE TIME  FIX NOT PLAYABLE  ITS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This games is like your misses sometimes it delivers however sometimes it s just full of aids
Good game keeps crashing
Very cool game amazing
PLEASE ENABLE REGION LOCK CHINA u just destroy ur golden ages devs and make it fast
targettingads needs worked oni want to be able to use targetting without ADS being forced toggled why can t i just switch it to be ADS is hold and targetting is toggle 
The Game is okay if they region lock China
Enough is enough Obviously the devs only care about their chinese hackers rebuying the game over and over Don t waste your money a real company will make a battle royale soon LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this indie cash grab Shameful
game needs to be fixed or given to an actually company that can actually fix all the hackers in this toxic LOVE LOVE LOVE  game also REGION LOCK THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Nice Game but Anti cheat system  and region lock to be added

wow best review
I really really really like Fortnite The only problem it has is the lack of FPS like pubg does One thing is for certain if they had it i would TOTALLY switch over PUBG developers and such are sapping money away from its players while doing no real fixes Yeah over the last year the game has made leaps and bounds but why does it feel like we recieved an Alpha that just finally became a Beta  With every update annoucments they are always an hour or 2 behind schedule Today they released a new update that made the game UNPLAYABLE and its been an hour with no update from facebook or twitter Let me save you a headache If you want to play a rubberbanding LOW quality graphics game Buy it Until the stone has been polished i would just wait ALSO REGION LOCK CHINA No hate on my asian family but the NA servers are legit OVERRUN by chinese team players and hackers that will headshot you 300 meters away while hipfiring with a crossbow
First game ever  Parachuting down  CRASH  Send error logs to companyWhat a POS
I d like to play the game but bugs and cheaters make that impossible
This game was once a wonderful Battle Royale but in the recent months has become nearly impossible to play due to what s become the largest hacking problem I ve ever seen in a PC gameThis evening is the last time that I ll ever play this game  I played six rounds that ended in being killed by a hacker four times Also of note is that these aren t just subtle hacks in this game these are people who are egregiously aim snapping full auto headshots through a mountinside that never had a line of sight on you at any point Despite the blatantly obvious cheating that s taking place and the  new and improved  reporting system nothing is being done and it only gets worse every dayCouple the insane amount of cheating with the constant bugs involving characters and vehicles getting stuck running into invisible objects and a myriad of unexplainable deaths to various other glitches and you have a game that s not worth playing as a free early access title let alone a 30  final release Take your money and your time elsewhere and please save yourself the frustration
Game is broken it is frustrating to play on most nights they are being a bit pushy with crates release and not so much on the gameplay and optimization stuff Buttime to queue for another game
get a better anti cheat untill then region lock china jesus LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing christ its so much fun getting auto hip fired from 500 yards
very good yes
this game is very dependent on your gpu and internet if either aren t up to date its almost unplayebleEdit   New update helped alot Less lag and rubber banding
This is no action game This is a horror game Good Luck1010 Would buy again
This game is Terrible In my opinion It may be the worst FPS to date It is 95  luck Hardly get decent loot Depending on where you land you can go a whole game without seeing a single person then randomly die by some sniper on a mountain a mile away The circles constantly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you The hit detection is garbage Half the time you will literally pump a full mag into someone seeing blood spurts the whole time Cheaters are going nuts 60 hours and I can t take it anymore Un installed
I have played this game for way too long and I can say it originally had potential and a good word of mouthHowever the obvious cheating has made this game unplayable I don t recommend this game due to the rampant cheating and clearly since you need to be the last one standing to win that is impossible with the large amount of cheating players who are aimbotting and blind scopping people I will never spend any money on their crappy keys for their crappy crates and finally don t waste your money on this crappy game until they get a handle on the cheating I am glad the developer made their millions already because I doubt anyone will spend any more money on this game in this shape
Cheatin afoot A runnin and agunnin a lootin and an ashootin we lose to abuse and I choose not stoop until there s a fix the chickens come to roost
best game 6910
1010 would get wall hacked again
i really wan t my money backso manny cheatersmade like 5 videos with those LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cheatersaim and no recoilplayer detector on the entire mapi don t like this game at all
I mean gun balance is kind of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  And performance its ok at least with 1500 pc but overall its an ok game i dont think it worth 30 if you planning to play alone But if you have at least 1 or 2 friends to play with well its good amount of fun
   Audience     Kids  Only very few Toxic People Hackers  A few Casual players Pro players   Graphics     Potato Really bad Bad OK Good  Beautiful  Masterpiece   Pricequality     Full price Wait for sale Average Refund it if you can 
Refunded regreted Now I find this game really good got a few kills under my belt Just give it a chance Great time waster RegionLockChina
I recommend this game because of various reasons 1 Good mapsSince Bluehole added their new map the game has been skyrocketing Not only does the new map give a variety in nature and enviorment but it really pops up in the details department The first map was already shocking in detail But the first map   in my personal opinion  lacked in varying landscape as such you would encounter landscape that would always look the exact same but only more   or different  buildings and vehicles would appear on those locations these landscapes would lack in cover and you would most likely have to crawl across Of course crawling across flat land was one of the most iconic things in PUBG that essentially built up the game from its core and some enjoy performing this But with this new map new landscapes buildings vehicles and weapons were introduced and it changed the gameplay experience completely by introducing these variations the players would often tend to never  get bored  Bluehole has been frequently updating   fixing bugs improving performance adding new weapons etc  even if you constantly get killed you never overcome the need to  Start  a new Match  and try again Thats what makes the maps in this game so enjoyableRealistic weaponsThe fact that you have to pick up ammo and attachments just makes the game a hundred times better the guns in the game perform fenomenally  Weapons spawns now became more balanced you will most likely find a weapon looting 2 3 houses Scopes and sounds are good Recoil is not too bad Generally I think the Bluehole developer team did a great job on the weapons   props also the looks of the guns GraphicsThis game can be mindblowingly beautiful if you set the game on Ultra Obviously this requires a beefy computer but the game generally looks really good even with medium graphics settings With these beefy graphics settings you can pretty much see anything and the landscape looks stunningly beautiful Definitely recommend if you own a beefy computerFirefightsFirefights in the game as beta version were incredibly unbalanced and you would most likely get shredded by a really professional player if you were a starter But nowadays the game is really balanced halfway into the game and almost everyone has the exact same equipment and you cannot call it an unfair fight by then Winning a firefight is incredibly satisfying sneaking up on someone is also incredibly satisfying and will probably spare you some health The gunplay in PUBG is amazing I myself enjoy FPP but TPP is really comfortable if you are an experienced fortnite playerBlueholeI really enjoy this game and I think Bluehole is a fantastic company I never heard of them until the starting screen of PUBG I love that the games base content is free to everyone   who bought the game  and I hope this game wont end up like every other game  Buy premium and you will unlock the full games content  Its really annoying when your favourite game introduces such transactions    caugh  bf1  caugh  Anyways thanks for reading and I hope Bluehole sees this I really like your game Keep it up
lots of hackers and team killers and people swear at each other and also i die when the person is freaking almost dead because my gun keeps on not letting me shoot This game is broken fix it

This game is great to play Awesome game to spend time with your friends and die together in a battle so survive For now the game seems pretty fun but if you want to buy this game right now I wouldn t recommend it because of all of the hackers that are in this game China is where most of the hackers are coming from but anyone could be on You just need the right tools I respect china and all but it s stupid in my opinion
I don t know why this game becomes so popular in just several monthsI m not fond of the solo mode in the game squad mode makes more sense to meThe game itself should be fine as it is You could collect different firearms and clothes and many more other items such like energy drinks or medicine during the gameplayOne point that makes me disappointed is that many of the players are ignorant they may not play any other shooter games before and they think the phenomena in the game are real which shows how much uniformed they are even completely have zero basic knowledge about the common armaments in the world And the only rifle they know in the world is this 762 cal 98K which they could ignorantly call other rifles as 98k when they see other rifles even not bolt action
Game is very bad and glitch hacker every two step region lock plz
WORST GAME EVER MADE DO NOT BUY THIS PILE OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   CHEATERS IN EVERY SINGLE MATCH DEVELPOERS DO NOTHING TO FIX PROBLEM  100  CHINESE PLAYERS ON EVERY SERVER INCLUDING NA THEY DONT SPEAK ANY ENGLISH CAN NOT COMMUNICATE MAKING ANY SORT OF GROUP PLAY POINTLESS  DYSNC AND LAG IS RIDICULOUS THE GAME IS SIMPLY NOT PLAYABLE  YOU NEED TO GET BEHIND COVER 3 SECONDS BEFORE YOU THINK SHOTS WILL COME AT YOU TO AVOID GETTING HIT OR DYING  HOW CAN THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  COMPANY KEEP TRYING TO SELL COPIES OF THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME WHEN ITS BROKEN  PLEASE REMOVE THIS GAME FROM STEAM AND REFUND EVERY CUSTOMER NOW STEAM SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF TO OFFER SUCH PILE OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THEY ARE ROBBING CUSTOMERS
good fun much good
So PUBG The game that really started the hype for Battleroyal games Without this game games like Fortnite etc or the expected Battleroyal mode in CoD BO4 wouldn t be possibleBut that s it really It s a springboard for these other games encouraged to try a game based around the gamemodeAlthough it s kept rather simple and realistic and thereby one of the few games that does so these days in military shooter simulation games  in contrast to Fortnite the game is poorly optimized It still to this day only runs mediocre on most PCs and laggs in high intense  pressure situations Not a lot of fun to be playing when one of the main points of the game is to survive said momentsThe game will die if the developers keep caring more about making money and rather releasing new cosmetic items than fixing and optimizing the game Because although it had its actual release and is not early access anymore you can t call it an actual final game yet it still hasn t overcome its early acces stageHad it not had the tremendeous support of twitch streamers that made the game as big as it is  or rather was in spite of having huge and even bigger technical problems than it has now they would have never come this farThis Video of The Act Man strengthens my point as well https wwwyoutubecomwatch vNs3bp2yWA1M

I love this game I really do I still continue to play it even though I don t recommend it for those who haven t played itThis game is hardcore It s competetive If you want a casual friendly experience with Battle Royale go play Fortnight You can and will get salty if you die to a camper or someone who snuck up behind you but that s not the real issue with this game The biggest issues with this game are the cheaters and the Chinese players on the other side of the world whose ping is consistently 200 ms on the NA Servers with no region locking planned for PUBG The latter issue is made worse by the fact that Battle Eye checked and confirmed that over 90  of the cheaters and hackers are coming from China which PUBG Corp has no intention of region lockingIn other words you have cheaters and hackers that can see and shoot you from behind walls 800 yards out with nothing but headshots landing and even if you could see them to shoot back before they kill you their ping will keep them alive just long enough to one shot you with a Kar98k And to re iterate PUBG has  NO  intention of region locking  ANYONE Yes the game has decent mechanics that are fun and rewarding if you can win Yes the game is actively being developed on Yes this game has plenty of potential to take Battle Royale to the next level againNo I do not recommend this game The positives are greater in number but the negatives have heavier impact and keep me from recommending PlayerUnkown s BattleGrounds
Well here we have another review for PUBG and yet another not recommended review at that The glitchy charm of the Early Access days are over and replaced by 250 loot boxes and more glitches than a Parkinson s patient on crack cocaine Today s bug of the day  Hard crashing my PC after every few matches Not just a freeze Actually shutting my PC off 410 only for squads with friends
TOO MANY HAKERS
1 The amount of cheaters is getting insane  Xray mods superfast shooting no recoil2 Performance got worse and worse after the release of 10 Before I had almost no problems now every 2nd 3rd match  long or stuck in loading screens no sounds controls LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up3 there is no region lock  most of the cheaters seems to be from there
i press the building keys but i cant build downvote pls
Excellent game design not hard to learn basics but challenging to masterDifferent people pick different goals   many people play for killscombat instead of outright victory That s fineInternet provides zillions of hotheads screaming about various bugs etc  200 hours in I have yet to see a cheater or a horde of Chinese zombies in single player mode  I m certain they exist I just haven t been affected by themGreat game overall
This game is not recommended You can litterally spend over 30 min getting good gear and killing people just to get killed by a guy using aimbot from 500m away Also the loot you get are totally RNG You can drop in a big building and just get a pistol while someone else can drop in a little shack by the road and get an ARThis game could be renamed to either PLAYERUNKNOWN S HACKERGROUNDS or PLAYERUNKNOWN S RNGGROUNDSI have way to much time in this game but i can not recommend it
The game has been fixed About 2 months ago i posted a negative review viewing the Chinese takeover of the EU servers but that has been dealt with The game has been optimised I have a good and solid 60 fps The game is awesome again and you should play it  D
awesome game xD
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up and it sucks
love the gamehigh tension high reward high learning curve and punishing fightswho wouldnt love this game yeah it has its share of problems but its fine
There are 3 different types of version when I purchase this game One is the game one is test server and another one is experimental server May I know which one should I download  Or is it compulsary to download all 
 
In Early Access it worked with sloppy bugs In 10 it crashes all the time  with sloppy bugsI really wonder how millions of people  at the same time are playing this without going mad
Played over 100 games in squads on OCE have had aussie team mates 3 times Please region ping lock the servers
its a really fun game even through there is plenty of bugs but the biggest problem in this game is the hackers and because the developers havent bothered to add region lock yet most of us on the AUS servers have to put up with chinese hackers kinda hard to enjoy the game when you know its pointless to try to win when you re gonna get killed by a hacker anyway if these problems are fixed this game will be great
this game is teaching us how to survive very fun game
Pros  Great game to play with friendsGood variety of weaponsMotorcycle is bad   Realistic aiming  aim upwards with increased distance2 humongous mapsCons  Unplayable online solo queuing with a partner   the reason being is you will get a chinese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE partnered with you 95  of the time  no exaggeration  The game has no mechanics to keep peopleon their own server  Chinese cheaters are prevalent
Peice of F cking s it game every f cking time i play squad I get DC d and most of the time i either drown or f cken get shotFIX YOUR SH T
   o 
SO TRASH
I think I ve won three times in my over 250 hours but at least you can strip down to your undies and scream at Chinese people the true American dream 35
love this game lots of fun you should check it out but there still are a few problems aside that its a really fun game
Too much cheating players has destoryed this game It is worse in North America Server As bluehole solves the huge problem I would change my comment
Despite of what most of them said about this game I don t regret buying it at all The game itself is definitely getting better and better in terms of performance and mechanics I had a LOT of fun playing solo most of the time even better with squad I recommend this game
Too expensive
This is a really fun game with tons of potential  It has it s flaws but they are regularly being addressed by the developers  Assuming the developers remain active this game will conintue to improveI have written a PUBG Survival Guide to help new players transition into the game  https wwwoldpcgamercompubg survival guide
Region Lock China does not help in respect of any point As a Chinese player I quite believe this company would not to do this until the Tencent successfully obtain Chinese gov s operating permission I know it sounds a little bit ridiculous that most of cheating tools will not functioning after its Chinese Tencent version start operating but we have some examples Leagues of legends is still meeting cheating and script problems in OC region but marjority of Chinese servers do not have such problems coz Tencent has created its special monitoring addonsI do admitt most of hackers of PUBG are from China and I hate them so much as you guys Not all Chinese players are hackers and believe me cheating tools are so expensive that 999  of players could not afford it  More than 1000USDmth So there is the problem who are using cheating tools  In China there are a lot of platform doing the same thing as Twitch Those guys earn millions of dollars a month by acting as a professional player Some of them are respected LOL players some are swithched from CS and OW In just no more than half a year all those players become quite professional and some of them had never played FPS or TPS before Amazing isnt it It does not means they are all cheaters one posibility might be that they have some team mates who are using cheating tools to give them directions As for those solo players on Chinese platforms we should ask Bluehole company  Why they had never got banned  Some of operations are not from human clearly 4 times scope without any vibration  What the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  are these  Bluehole do you really think they are making ads for you  They are just teaching their audiences to buy cheating tools they are making ads for cheating tools companyConclusions are quite clear these cheaters are not using any wise or high tech tools I quite believe there are some business behind the public You may not agree with me but this is the turth I saw in ChinaAgain not all Chinese players are cheaters We love this game so much Locking Chinese region only shows how irresponsible and incompetent the Bluehole is And those who calling for region lock China do not argue with Chinese players they are not the ones who should be blamed I can completly understand your feeling coz last week when I nerved myself play one more round PUBG and quickly killed by cheaters I finally uninstall this game
dont get me wrong the games dope as hellwhen its working crashes neary every game for some reason or another
Horrible game every update is more devestating to the gameplay then the last The loot is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the gameplay is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and the vehicles are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  its like the developers just want to drive this game into the ground but atleast theyre trying to cash out by putting more loot boxes into the game i mean who doesnt like cosmetics over gameplay and dont even get me started about the the load issues if you dont have a ssd in turn if you like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing yourself over by buying a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game then by all means go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yourself
Great game that I ve been constantly playing ever since I purchased it around three weeks ago  and have racked up 85 hours since I would recommend this to a friend however giving this game a perfect review would not give the developers incentive to fix the game s glaring flaws and things to improve upon including FOR THE LOVE OF GOD REGION LOCK CHINA Everybody is asking for it and the devs know it so do it already It s well known that most of the hackers in the game come from the Asian servers and connect to the NA servers just because their higher ping gives them an edge game play wise Great game just make it better and it gets five stars from me
Good game if not for the poor framerate whenever shots are fired   since the new update every single crate you get needs a key which costs real world money so say goodbye to customizing your character
Laaag and Laaaag this game can t even be playedi waste money on a game that have problems with servers
So my big dislike of the game currently is the Chinese At times when nobody i know are online I play random squad games However lately there is a bit of a communication problem Like today my rando squad of chinese players is attacked as the blue was passing over Two were killed outright and one was KO ed on a rooftop I hear the attackers speeding off in a vehicle before i was close enough to attack I go out of my way while being damaged by blue to find a way onto this roof and revive my remaining team member Then I locate a buggy and go to pick him up from looting his buddies What does he do  He shoots me in the face KO s me and starts screaming at me in Chinese I inform him i speak english He revives me then KO s me again with a frying pan Rinse repeat screaming at me the whole time like i am suposed to know what he is saying he KO s me and revives about 5 times in total before I returned the favor and let him die took his meds and had to travel 34 of the way acrost the map to get back to zoneRegionLockChina
Good Concept Needs Lot of bug fixes and server improvementsotherwise 45
Couldn t pause update when I wanted to watch a video 510 Play it on console
ez chikn
Great game with amazing graphics and textures i love how even after a loss you just want to play more since its so satisfying to be able to rise to the top of everyone
There is no reason to seal the number for no reason The information is not informed Not recommended
OP LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
wow good game
PUBG is a good game with some major bux fixes here and there But some of these bugs make the game fun But recently I feel like PUBG you can t have fun anymore It s like a grind to win There is nothing to aim for but crates Recommendations to Add to Game  Daily ChallengesSomething like a Battle Pass from FortniteFun gamemodes
Good gamebut way too much hacker
Hella fun if you play with your friends
Im sick of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing asians taking over NA serversLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing speak english or play on your re server
My only complaint is that there is no  Firing Range  It would be easier for me  a new player and others to get to know the weapons and their knockbacks better You could of course practice in an online match but this would take a lot of time and you couldwill die over and over before you get the hang of it I ve played some matches now and recently it was the first time I found a Kar98 Of course I had no experience with that weapon which lead to my death  or because I m a noob Don t get me wrong I love this game and I will play it in the future even if there s no firing rangeThat s why I give it a 910
Game is too reliant on luck with circles and loot Movement and gunplay is clunky but still enjoyable Game freezes constantly with most recent update For 30 the game is satisfactory not counting the freezing
It s very goodYesGood game
               
This game is amazing        TIP  You need to be very hardcore
This is good game
yeh its aight
This game is plagued by Chinese hackers and the developer  PLAYERUNKNOWN is a very biased person who instead of listening to the wishes of the playerbase for a ping limit or region lock  he rather just call the NA players  Xenophobes  and ignore this massive game breaking problem
the developers are more worried about thier money then my nerdy LOVE LOVE LOVE  who sits on it all day 1010 would find 2 hackers in every game again
all these updates and you can still get hit behind walls i had high hopes for this game
This game when there are no cheaters is actually revolutionary for online shooters but the past 20 games I ve played have consistently had game ending cheaters Until the developers fully fix this harmful that currently plagues this game I cannot recommend purchasing it
Hi i have some problem with this game i get 15 20 fps all time i got a 940m that have the last update on it 8gb ram and a core i5 i tried the nvidia optimize but it only made it to 25 26 fps can some one help me with this 
doesnt start when i click on it
This is my first review as i knowGame is awesome first of all but it became frustratingAnyhow the level of damage of the blue zone at the end of battle is ridiculousIt makes game totally chaotic You are playing 25mins or so just to get humped by the blue zonePositioning is useles if you encounter other people that you have to fight losing precious timeLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chaos
I dont like
broken game full of cheats waste of money
hi devs xxcan you plz add a way to ride trikesluv from me xx
Tyler Perry s Boring Grounds looting simulator 2017
More like Cheatergroundsdeveloper needs to put in more anti cheat measures
Just got killed by a Chinese hacker after the 5th anti cheat update i reported and i m making a refund
except few bugs n netcode issue the game is just awesomeexpecting that fix soon   i totally recommend this game
This game is a hit or miss Sometimes you ll have games that make sense or you ll have game where there s aimbotters or something stupid happen In my honest opinion this game is NOT worth the 30 dollars Edit  It s almost like this game got even worse after each update The cheaters are becoming more frequent and every single time I land in densely populated areas it s always the cheater that comes up on top Every game unless i m lucky and someone kills or I kill the cheater from behind all you will hear are broken shots that somehow hit you from inside a building without any windows I wish I knew how much bad this game was going to get  Would not recommend until they fix the game Loot has been worse with each update too
So I got an update from you guys today and while trying to watch replay s the game crashed twice in 5 minutes GG I hate that I love this garbage game
This game is full of nothing but non english speaking players on NA servers hackers and bugs PUBG thanks for the memories but you re trashYou re just a mod that got cool
trash lmao
Pretty dope game
Rampant Cheatershackers Stupid updates that don t fix core issues Lag and technical problems mean 12 games is unplayable Regionping lock needed to keep Chinese hackers and griefers out of normal servers This game made me racist i d vote for trump if he promised a wall around chinese servers
Literally the WORST game I ve ever played in my life I ve never seen a game release even in betas or alphas this garbage LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  company has some of the most idiotic mentally inclined people working on development Mechanics are awful it feels jagged at all times I ve been team killed by chinese players playing NA servers but there s 3 regions for Asia but they all come to our servers  REGION LOCK NEEDS to be implimented Cheating is worse than counter strike and it wasn t worth the 30 bucks I through into this game If you don t cheat speak mandarin or don t have self esteem issues do not buy this gameOn the other hand if you hate your mother love speaking chinese and getting aimbotted across Russia Go for it Douse your allowance on this awful trash gameThis game is the epitome of failure and I honestly can say it s worse than 100 911 s
less than 2hrs on file probably wont play it agin
I enjoy this game but they need to optimise it I am sick and tired of frustrating deaths because of frame drops and lagging mid combat
Region lock China like this review to get it noticed Seriously Region lock is needed
This game straight up Pisses me off ill play a game  die  not play for a few Weeks then get back on  and Repeat  I F  KING hate it
this game is not bad i like it its more slow then some shooters but its fun
worth the money
This game is  fun with friends but my friends dont have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hand
Im addicted to this game its perfect
polecam
I got a permanent bann for cheating when I never have before You think this game would show more Courtesy to players with 350 hours in the game
this game is so addicting so i dont want to recomend it to anyone LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the developers of this game so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing insane
addictive as hellover run with hackers   4 out of 5 games have cheatsBluehole trying to hide the problem rather than fix itdsync problems causing hits not to register on high ping playersSave your money untill fixed of wait for the next title
kkkkkk
great game ma friends buybuy
Unoptimized which sucks and has alotta bugs but makes this game so screwed up but kinda fun at the same time
i guess ill go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  myself
Crazy how Fortnite is better than this once great game now
fantastic game it gets the blood pumping Theres no other feeling then winning that CHICKEN DINNER Just be careful to play it with friends this game is the quickets way to turn bestfriends into worst enemy s IM SORRY JAKE I THOUGHT HE WAS SOLO I DIDNT KNOW HE HAD 3 OTHER GUYS WITH HIM But yeah overall fantastic game
Being on steam for over 8 years I have never wrote a review But after recent events with PUBG I feel like I need toHacks cheatsheat and high ping players have ruined this game Its not  xenophobia against Chinese players but when most of the cheats are coming from that part of the worldthats where things need to startBrendan Green is a sell out LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for not protecting his game from this onslaught its all about the moneyBluehole is a sell out LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  also its all about the oney EA games the worst company of all time in the gaming world I dont think so Bluehole and Mr Green enjoy your fatwallets while you make fools of yourselvesREGIONLOCK CHINA
My First Battle Royale game was H1Z1 which I liked very muchBut this game brought more to it and I really love the UI and various aspects of this gameVery Nicely Developed Thank you guys for developing such a wonderful game  
Filled with challenging opponents and challenged teammates
Everytime I get a good loadout Im insta sniped by some bloke with aimbot Not to mention the surplus of chinese players in NA servers who are doing most of the hacking REGIONLOCK
Fix it
Cheaters are getting eliminated in an efficient way at least from the Asia Pacific Servers which I am connecting to Game is fun funnier if playing duo or team mode Love the idea that you need to find your weapon and your way to the center Finally gameplay over graphics Old school never dies
Game itself is fine apart from the broken vehicles and gun physics Obviously big problem with chinese cheaters which is obviously condoned by PUBG corp as they will do anything but stop it Another problem is the proverbial middle finger given to consumers in the form of micro transactions You grind away at the ame to earn ingame BP which you then spend on lootboxes with a maximum of 6 boxes per week which is fair enough The problem comes when you don t get a say in which box your given as the majority of boxes require you to then go and spend 250 real money on a key to open it for a 9999999  chance of getting a mediocore or trash item From this I would highly recommend to not buy this game and instead go play fortnite for free
a lot of  wall hackings LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing  server  junk game  go LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I keep hoping that the issues this game has will be addressedresolved by Bluehole but so far I haven t noticed any of the main problems that ruin the experience be fixed I ve never written a game review before but Pubg brings a new level of frustration into gaming to where I felt I needed to do my part and warn those who are considering buying the game of some of the problems that I experience trying to playIt feels as though any given match you join you can be sure that you or your squad will encounter another player who is using hacks or at the very least have some very questionable death cams going on It seems that these players are almost always speaking Chinese and although I have no issues with people playing on different regions than where they are playing from it seems like something should happen with the playerbase until an effective anti cheat system can be implementedServers will consistently go offline and you ll need to reconnect as well as the game itself crashing once or two a session I know I haven t written much and there is a lot more on my mind about things that could go better but I m already over this reviewThose of you who are on the fence should wait until the community starts signaling that problems have been fixed I will still play and put up with the bs but to be honest I m getting closer to calling this one quits until it gets better
one of the first big battle royale styles but manages to be the most boring of them all
Apart from the lag server crashes rubberbanding asians hackers de syncing glitches very inconsisted loot slow servers 140FPS looking like 40 FPS China 1 stuttering non working vehicle physics bad optimization and the constant search for Thomasit s pretty good910 would get chicken dinner again
1010 best game NA
wish they would region lock the servers or somethingi really hate tryin to play group games with nothing but loud techno and gibberisham i alone on this   
Great game but something has to be done to lock people to their own continents
personally I cannot reccomend it not a bad game just not my taste
The game is not very playable or enjoyable at the moment  glitches lag hackers I still play it only to talk to the chinese
Great game and great team working on it Never personally encountered cheaters and I have 300  hours Can t see why this has 50  positive Probably people salty who accuse everyone of HAX
I really had high hope for this game when I bought it but if I hear someone say  China number one  one more time I m going to shoot myself Also I have a good 8 hours in this game and not once have I been killed by someone that isn t using aimbot
hackers hackers hackers mostly china those ppl cant play fair total LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t
I recommend playing PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds merely because each match is different than the previous weather it s rng location skill etc It can be frustrating most times but the feels of a chicken dinner
Awesome game  i ve been playing since early release  i just wish they could get the game optimized as good as Battlefield  A lot of my games have lag   dSync problems  It s so much different when playing Battlefield or Fortnite  Hopefully they can get it good soon  
                                     pubg has client sided hit detection so those battleye bans you re so fond of yeah they re not doing anything  _ _in other words great game i could spend years on this game just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing do the thing above pleaseoh yeah tip  if you want easy chicken dinners go on asia servers it may sound horrible due to the chinese hackers already but you WILL encounter them less and they re just ez bots
I never cheated and I don t know what hack happend and I got ban for 100 years wast my money and brok my heart I would never ever purches any game from this company or related developerHope steam can reture my money if possible
BEST GAME EVER i already have 78 hours and i bought this game 2 weeks ago highly recomend it
No Just no
why  you  want block  
Worst gaming experience I ve had in a very long time This game suffers from so many issues that it is not worth playing Too many hackers too much server lag too many glitches Two small maps with the same dozen copy pasted buildings not comparable to something like the maps from Arma 2 OA Inbuild VPN for no good reason you can choose the servers you want to play on No region or ping lock Way too much RNG in form of bad loot and zone luck The sound engine is trash Quality and intensity of the sound fluctuates way too much Sound sources are sometimes off their actual positions by several meters   Definitely not something I can tolerate in a game where I fully need to rely on my ears to find out where exactly the enemy isshiny shiny graphics but i would so much rather play arma 2 again too bad that it s practically dead since 2014 and the successor doesn t live up to the expectationsUpdate 31032018 This game is still a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing joke Despite having a good computer by modern standards the game laggs for no apparent reason when someone nearby starts shooting Half of my shots that hit the enemy don t get registered blood sprays all over the place but no damage is dealt Motorcycles are death traps which put you into the matrix before you fall of and hit the ground at 100 kmh on flat surfaces More than the half of my deaths can be assigned to bugs glitches and a ton of cheaters The aimbots and no recoil mods are so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing obvious in the deathcam Sometimes the cam doesn t load due to  unusual movements which have been detected  as you try to review the footageOh and I should mention that I need 20 30 shots fired from the AK47 or M416 to knock out and kill a player from a distance less than 5 meters This is in the full auto mod and 80  of the bullets hitting yeah no that s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t especially when considering that at least 5 of those shots go straight into the head Meanwhile the cheaters can kill me with their Kar98k  with a heatshot through a level 3 helmet This game is rigged as hellInstead of addressing the real issues with the game   awful hitscan due to clientside detection inbuild VPN allowing chinese cheaters to join wherever they please cheats in general unbearable server lag making bullet leading next to impossible predetermined safe zones no map selection broken vehicle physics and tons of other stuff I m too lazy to list   they keep adding game mods items a new map and now also weapon skins similar to the stuff known from CS GO Nothing of real value is done the developers are only on their mission to get as much money out of this crap as possibleUpdate 20 minutes later After reading a few reviews I can safely say that this simply isn t worth my time I played 11 games today blatantly obvious cheaters killed me at least 4 times We won a single game as a 4 men squad This game isn t fun it s only addictive and something I thought was great to play with my friends as everyone had bought it
To break it all down  The NA and EU servers are flooded with high ping players from China because of this you are often killed because of lag or cheating which can ruin the experience A dedicated group of friends or a Discord server is ESSENTIAL because all the teammates you re paired with randomly most likely does not speak the same language as you which ruins cooperation in teams which also ruins the experience  Meanwhile the developers are calling any fan of the game a racist when addressing these issues while they work at establishing micro transactions and condemning other Battle Royale games when PUBG itself is also unoriginal in some aspects  Conclusion  Just play Fortnite
it s a good game but full of hackers hard to recommend
Do you all remember when Pubg was filled with Americans  We all had a blast playing this poorly optimized game then the chinese came Hackers galore The Devs even said most of the hackers come from China If they wanted to stop this nonsense they could They simply don t care though  All these guys even care about now Broken game
Veri nice
Released in 2017Shooting from 2015 Graph from 2014Interface from 2011Gameplay idea from 2005 2007Optimization from 2000But demands for computer from 2020By the way Game have 8510

PUBG is not JUST a game It is life and death It gives and takes whether it s the satisfaction of laying that heartwarming headshot or getting panned from behind this game is always making my heart feel something intense Will you recieve life in the white circle or lose your all in the blue Will you get that tasty warm chicken dinner or will you starve and continue the neverending struggle  Will you save your life or lose it to this game For I know I am far too lost to saveHighly recommended for those who have no life Thumbs up 1 to the fun 810 would die again
As a whole it s very good just hoping to optimize the color It really makes the eyes difficult
played 1 game and crashed played 2nd game and got killed by a blatant chinese cheater never played since
w
I ve put a couple hours into the game There are bugs but if you play with a group of friends it is one of the best games out there right now
This is a review for PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds I have had so much fun playing this game Aside from the occasional loading bug I have found this game to be one of my favorite games They have made tremendous progress as well I remember playing this game when it was first available and it was a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  show of lag and bugsThe developers have really listened to their players and added tons of cool stuff to the game while also upgrading the performance LOVE LOVE LOVE I recommend this game whole heartedly
You can have fun with this game but I can guarentee it will frusterate you more than you can have fun Glitches bugs lagconnection issues cheaters maybe I m just bad whatever it s not a good game It s just a good idea
The game that the jedi survival just bought is not played in the net bar how long to be blocked the confusion is interesting  Game developers see an explanationRole name yy60184525
Respected developers your game experience is very poor because I do not know the reason is ban decided not to experience this game I also want to think about the friends you want to buy There s a lot of it out The war of immortals Bye bye
HOW THE HELL IM BANNED BEFOR I PLAY IT I JUST BUY IT BEFOR 3WEEKS AND I INSTALLED IT TODAY AND IT SAY BANNED FROM STEAM GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
this game is a hot piece of buggy garbage and it hasent improved since launch if you are looking for a battle royal last man standing experince i would either download Fortnite for free or buy SOS 30 dollars is expesive for how little content they have and again with bugs your not in Early Access any more so whats the excuse now  Oh and they tried to get mad at Fortnite a FTP game for doing the same idea only better you actually have fun with the HOT new addition to the game paid for keys and loot chests seriously  its like they paid no attention at all with the EA BF2 loot crate scandal
really cool game
NEW MAP IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
The company is too silly
too many cheaters
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME   In general it is a great concept and you will enjoy it for apprx 1 moth after buying while you still think you are a noob But after a month when you already gained enough experience and learnt how to use the stuff in the game you will  keep wondering how is that you still at the level of a noob  Then you realize that it is the not a problem  with you but with the large amount of cheaters who have no recoil heal instantly and  use some kind a wall hackingand aimbot IT IS almost IMPOSSIBLE to play a normal balanced game Before I bought this game I read all the reviews about cheaters but I did not believe them I regret deeply that imprudenceSAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY
710   optimization
This game cucks me so many god damn times but I love it it is almost like stockholm syndrome 100 people 99 gets killed to absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t I have so many funny things happen in this game  most of them are from hitting a teammate with a car and so many amazing moments that makes this game awesome Right now hackers are a big problem which probably leads to the LOVE LOVE LOVE  blasting 56  positive review rate this game has right now so they better do something about it Other than that the adrenaline rush at the final circles are amazing and that is what I play this game mostly for but being killed when there are only 2 people left is the worst feeling ever your heart is beating and you know you did something LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that made you take the L Other than that and the thirty thousand bugs this game is GOD DAMN DECENT
This game sucks to many hacks want my money back
Account got hijacked Got my account permabanned Support says no appeals allowed

would not recommend  at this time so many ppl using aim bots not even worth trying to play at this pointregionlockchina
NO PROBLEM A GOOD GAME
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cheaters I m quitting playing the game cause it s really impossible to keep on going with this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   DEather you give possibility to other people to cheat or to organize own private games or this is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up and unplayable
fun game terrible developers
lots of hackers and needs region lock if this can get fixed it will be a great game for now i feel like i wasted 36 for nothing
It s pretty fun though I do have one question  When is the patch that makes the game  work coming out 
I m tired of having the game perform horribly despite having spent a ton on hardware  overclocked 7700K 1080TI and it s still garbage   50 FPS in the plane really I m tired of having people with clearly high latency connections not having their inputs being taken with a grain of saltI m tired of stupid inventory bugs that KILL you because the client fails to pick up an item or the server fails to register that you re holding a weapon Bonus  remember when the developers thought it was a good idea to add latency to picking up items because people who didn t pay attention to how good people play didn t know that they could drag in the inventory instead of using F to pick up items  Seriously  What made the developers think that was a good idea I m tired of the idiotic loot tables that leave you with just a pile of clothes vertical grips and P92s while AR shots are being taken all around youMost of all I m tired of the excuses There s just so much broken with this game and because there s no sign that things are getting better it s just not fun anymore I thought I could make it past the one year mark but I guess that s not happening Here s hoping Batallion 1944 is all it s hyped up to be
Good game fix lags remove cheaters improve fps and get region lock Game will be the best
More hackers than bullets in this game
Very good Very Nice
Not bad but not good
Very nice game after the big update  a few weeks ago  Really nice graphics  very original idea of gameplay  I like this game very much because it is very simple  Just kill and survive  So awesome
wrong conncet sever please fix
Hasn t made enough money to keep the servers running apparently
this game is the best game to play
I thought cs go is the only game with 90  hackersThen I met PUBG
this game is full of hacker  do something you motherLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er bluehole  you are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trash gaming
This is my first review and i must tell you this game is full of chines hackers and completely useless and unplayable  
ShadOW_1980GOOD
LOVED IT
Servers are always too busy  
i pay rm80 just to meet chinese hacker and bad connection server
better than battle royale
great game if u guys wan to play survival games
Game is good and fun but PUBG allows hackers Out of 10 games i will see hackers in 1 or 2 games NOT worth to buy the game for Rs 999 
You will have an angle locked down which you know someone will walk intoYou will shoot them the instant you see them They will have terrible reaction time and bad ping They will still win Why  Because they already turned the corner and shot you on their end 300ms ping guy walks around the corner sees you and shoots150ms to tell the server he walked around the corner plus your ping for the server to tell your computer to display themThe death cam will show you staring blankly off into space as if you never saw them turn the corner People with high enough ping can peek kill you and pop back behind cover before you even see themThe region locking everyone is requesting is a bandaid solution mind you The netcode is the root issue I wouldn t recommend supporting this developer until they do something about it It is so atrociously bad it makes the old CoD4MW2 engine netcode look like a masterpiece It s quite dissapointing they ve made no attempt to fix this core issue with the insane amount of money this game has made The final straw for me writing a negative review was allocating their manpower towards building a new map rather than working on polishing the core experience It tells us they don t prioritize it as an issue
I love this game  3  3  3
add ping counter in gmae and make adding friends in game easy
fix the god damn game from broken physics and hackers
amazing game love it
Good meme material
Feels like a free2play
This game was really good at the start lots of promise and great moments Now it is full of cheaters people lagging out and paid crates What was once a promosing game has turned bad Such a shame RIP
this update is killing me all the new stuff and change
Running simulator 2018When you speak Chinese and instantly get screamed at and get called a hacker even before the game has started gr8I r8 88fix anti cheat plsand optimize game ty
Buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Controls don t make sense Huge barrier to entry
Probably the game I had the most hours in and the best time playing that I also was never very good at The trouble for me is I don t have a playgroup and I think that s a major part of the experience   solo matches are still quite interesting but it doesn t really compare Still this is my first real online shooter game and I enjoyed it enough to drop 30 hours in so I feel like I got my money s worth
too many laggy chinese
Ebola
bad optimized game  chinese all over NA  blatant hackersif you guys actually optimize the game the game would be more fun and playable
Dear Bluehole Your lack of action towards hackers is ruining the game it should not be hard with the death cam and replays to ban them This is why im almost never playing this anymore the good experiance of playing is replaced with anger and frustration making this game very very S H I T And region lock chinaEdit  STILL TERRIBLE BLUEHOLE YOUR ANTI CHEAT DONT WORKAND NOT COMPADIBLE WITH WINDOWS 10 CRASHES ALL THE TIME
The huge amount of stupid problems in this game is unbelievable
Loot for 20 minutes  CheckGame crashes  CheckYou character dies while you re frantically trying to log back inIt would have been ok if this was just a one time thing But this happends like every 10th game My friends have the same problem Would have been nice if they fixed this soon it s been around for ages
This game is so riddled with cheaters that I wish I could get my money back  Bluehole KNOWS it KNOWS it is all out of 1 region  looking at you China and refuses to address the issue  When Bluehole gave away some ingame currency to make up for a math error 99  of users said  keep your currency and region lock the servers to keep the Chiniese cheaters out of US servers  If you are considering getting this game you should think long and hard about the fact that your odds of playing A SINGLE MATCH without seeing hackers is basically non existant  Do NOT RECCOMMEND this game based soley on the cheating and the lack of response from Bluehole who obviously cares more about money than gamers which is really sad since the Dev is a gamer PlayerUnkown is SELL OUT
The worst game I have ever bought simply because it doesnt work It is the worst optimised game I have ever played Relasing a new map cool but I would say fixing the game is the first thing you do not add to the cluster LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  It would proabably be my favourite game if it didn t crash 247

REALLY GOOD GAME BUT REALLY NEED SOME IMPROVE ON SOME OF THE SERVER PING
very nice game i give it a 810
I love this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game
This game would be 810 and not a 610 if there was not so many chinese players on OCE server
This game is stupid but fun but only when I m in a duo or squad with my friends on voice chat  The pacing is really weird for a game but a lot more like real life combat    long periods of nothing or unrelated activity but no clear information on when you should do anything and then suddenly from out of the blue a quick engagement and death  yours or the enemy Lots of cases where it s better to be stealthy vs engage enemies too
This is one of those titles that reminds you why we go to war I find great sadistic pleasure in killing Chinese players in North American servers Makes me feel like I m protecting the homeland from the Red Menace Eat lead red
Buggy AF  Jump on a box  Fell on the corner  Non stop falling action basically got stuck  Can t even vault  KMS  Got Revived by team  Team got Stuck  Team Died  UninstallEDIT    Rides on a bike  Tumbled  Exploded   Confused
it is really bood
Dear PUBGYour game becomes crap after every single time you update this game and its getting on my freaking nerves So no i will not recommend this game until they truly fix their crapwith all the money u bank in at least make an update that dont actually suck
This game is really bad the idea is great the execution is terrible do with that what you will I m mad
Way to many cheaters run into one at least half of the time
I have spent way to much time playing this game Theres a lot of hackers But the game itself is great
PUBG is the most fun game you should never buy I can t really do anything more than reiterate what has been said a thousand times but please DON T BUY THIS GAME I ve had it since about two months before 10 PUBG is probably the biggest game in the world right now and the developers could not care less about the community Nothing has been done about region locking the game except for PlayerUnknown calling his playerbase racist for wanting to be able to communicate with one another Cheating is rampant The game still runs like garbage Rather than taking the obscene fortune they have amassed from the millions of sales and using it to fix the game they implement a horrid new loot box system to milk even more money from players And on top of all of that they have the audacity to call this broken mess a full  release game It was a ton of fun at first but it quickly became apparent that that fun came from the stolen game concept not from the passion of the developers If this game hasn t gone full DAYZ within two years I ll be amazed
I love the game but not the devs 10 introduced more issues to the game and they seem to be more worried about the new paid crate system than actually fixing the bugs and server issues Cheaters have also ruined the experience Give it a few more months before you buy
INTERNET CONNECT IS SUCK
trash game devs keep it updated but the only changes i see being made are more guns clothes and maps before any actual bugs are fixed
Great job guys you successfully ruined one of the most popular games by completely changing the feel of the game with a single patch update ARs especially have been ruined as they feel like they all have sks type recoil and the ads feels like im in slow motion Also the number of hackers managed to increase somehow
It s a great game but every game i play is full of chinese player with 400 ping just screaming in their mics
This game has devolved into the next Modern Warfare in a short amount of time  At least half the games played for the past few weeks has resulted in a death by someone who either has an aimbot tracks you PERFECTLY through walls and behind cover or somehow knows where all the good loot is and runs STRAIGHT to it according to replayThese are not coincidences these are cheatersThe North American server is also flooded with people from another country as well who are a hindrance when teamed with on squads thanks to their inability to communicateIf they do not eliminate the cheating and lock the regions this game will die extremely fast  Other developers are making their own Battle Royale style games as I type this if PUBG wants to stay at the top they have to get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together FAST
So far this is the best Battle Royale game that I have ever playedPLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is most likely going to make you frustrated All the bloodthirsty virgins out there wants to see you dead They want to prove that they are the alpha of the virtual map This is not acceptable so I decided to be the alpha I used all kinds of methods in order to become the alpha and then I figured it out I have to use psychological warfare I started yelling into my microphone as I saw some random virgins nearby I ran closer and closer to them I could sense their fear and as they saw me they shot me down
This games concept is pretty unique What makes it unique is that the area forces you to get closer to the enemy as the time goes on and it s basically survival of the fittest in every way you can imagine I think some of the game is bland though Character models look uninteresting Vehicles are uninspiring The weaponry isn t really anything cool or futuristic Bare bones stuff I d get the game but I m not going to reccomend you buy it for 40 dollars Wait until a Steam sale
kinda fun but the vehicles are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed  Bikes mostly You go flying into the air randomly without even having to hit a bump Died numerous times due to glitches with bikes I have died due to the game thinking I have been falling even though I wasn t numerous times A lot fo cheaters Asians mostly that play in NA Game doesn t run good Not enough vehicles sometimes not enough loot in the map The game in itself it insanely filled with bugs Not esports ready When they fix the game I ll change my review
at the shop
Good game best battle royale
Absolute trash of a game do not spend your money worst optimized game ive ever played cant run the game with out it freezing PlayerUnknown is worthless
Honestly this game was great until it exploded in popularity and the FLOOD of cheaters came in  Bluehole need to sort their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out and deploy a proper anti cheat system
Cheaters cheaters everywhere
This used to be a good game until recent i d recommend Fortnite more than thisI wouldn t recommend buying this game until they fix the lag issue that is present I have specs well above the recommended specs and it maxs out my GPU every time even when i play on LowMedium GraphicsThe server search is beyond a joke assigning you to EVERY region in the game before delegating you to one that you never even wanted I set myself to default EU  from UK and i get pushed to the NA serversI feel sorry for the person who gifted me this as they ultimately wasted their money
In North American server one has to ask if anyone speaks English  Thats all that needs to be said
Servers are terrible gameplay is awful pointless LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
In it s current state the game is complete garbage Lag and desync issues server delay of 1 second sometimes more and horrible optimization  can t get more than 80 100fps with a titan and new generation i7
As much as I want to love this game I can t Hackers run rampant Chinese will teamkill anyone that isn t chinese even though they are playing on NA servers and this game is the literal embodiment of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  The game itself is fun it has it s flaws but overal gameplay is enjoyable Until Blue Hole does something about the hacking situation and region locks chinese players I can t give it a positive rating Should they keep ignoring these issues the game will just die off
We need to segregate the Chinese and English speakersin this game this is discusting
E sports ready btw
PLEASE WATCH MY CHEATER PROOF VIDEO SHARE THIS REVIEW https wwwyoutubecomwatch vzcqR6fNAL g featureyoutubeTHE GAME HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY CHEATERS DO NOT BUYThe game used to be great in the first 6 months or so  Action driven goal oriented and different every gameNow just about every game specifically the TPP  third person servers are completely overrun by Chinese cheaters  I have about 30 different recorded videos of blatant ESP cheats and Aimbot  The game is unplayable right now in its current state and Bluehole is doing nothing but banning cheaters that just go out and buy the game again to cheat  Why would they fix the problem when cheaters are buying the game over and over again making them more money     FPP  first person  servers do not have nearly as many cheaters but I shouldn t have to stick to one gameplay mode  Chinese cheaters have RUINED this game and yes Bluehole and BattleEye have both confirmed the majority of cheaters come from China  2 Million cheaters banned so far  In ONE replay alone I was able to identify FIVE count it FIVE cheaters blatently using ESP cheats  Following people s movement through mountains and whatnot  Please let Bluehole know we will not stand with this business practice of catering to cheats
68532
Region lock  or will someone please create a knock off that is region locked so its enjoyable again
One of the most overhyped games of 2017 another pre release survival game with nothing to offerControls graphics sound are all subpar Cheating is a huge problem Only reason this will stay afloat for a couple of years is because of Shroud Summit1G and DrdisrespectDon t fall for the hype go play something else and save yourself the headache
Great game alot of fun specially with friends only thing i could say is sometimes its a bit buggy in menu and load ins but otherwise alot of fun highly recommended
NA FATE PEO
After you ve started playing this game you are having sometime fun But mostley this game is a waste of timeThe gameplay You start playing and wait a minute untill the game starts Than a plane is crossing a map and you choose when to go down As there are up to 100 players you need to choose your start area carefully If you choose the wrong area  a hotspot with a lot of weapons you might die immidiately without finding a weapon Yes there is a option to clear a spot If you do so you feel very cool But this is even for good players just working out sometimes So expect at least three bad games for one cleared areaThe other option is to go somewhere into nowhere You will run around and search weapons Mostly finding crap You do this for 5 10minutes Sometimes you will get killed why doing this from your back If you are a guy who loves collecting crap this is probably the best way to play this game I think this just suck Running around and searching crap for up to 10 minutes is just bulls  t for meLets suppose you finished this and you are still living You need to move always to be in the living zone An intelligent way to move is helping you to pass to the endgame This kind of gameplay is really okayAt the end everybody is camping somewhere as long as possible If you want to win you need to hide and save your armor and helmet for the very last endgame If you don t do this your position will be known by the enemys around you If you are in the endgame you might get a higher pulse because you spend so much time and so many f   ed up games into getting there This is really cool at the beginningGetting a win over a lot of other players makes you feel very cool and strongProblems  Cheaters  Especially if you manage to get further into the game you will meet cheaters very often This is simple mathematic You play with 99 other guys The chance that one of these is hacking is very high The further a game is in progress you will meet exactly this cheater because the cheater is going to win This really sucks so hard Getting a game destroyed by a cheater where you managed to pass the first part of the game is ridiculous There are all kind of hacks possible Speedhack ESP Wallhack AimhackAimassitanceSome people say that the cheaters are always Chinese guys playing on servers everywhere in the world This is in my opinion wrong Everywhere in the world are cheaters Some guys just try to find culprits Server Performance  Was really bad before the game gets released Now it is acceptable Client Performance  The requirements are high Don t suppose to hide in the grass to early The grass might not be rendered for your enemies and you are an easy target Engine  The engine is not good for the game There are so many bugs Test for example the collision The models seems to be just a box The moving is akward Very bad map design in my opinion A lot of stuff in the map is just buyed at the market place One gamemod and nothing to customize You can t even choose the map you want to play Skillbased matchmaking  It is not working out I know that there are news about PUBG having one But honestly this one feels not working correctly What they did  They stopped showing the rank of the guy who killed you So now there couldn t be real evidence that this is not working Maybe there is a very bad skillbased matchmakingHowever this game is probably the most successful online game ever There are so many fanboys out who love this game more than anything else That s why I would say you should test this game if you have too much time and you are searching for an alternative to your main game Especially if you are loving to run around and collect stuff this Shooter is the right thing for youFor me all the gamesessions in the past weeks ended in hating this game It honestly was a waste of time I don t like collecting stuff I hate the RNG in this game I hate the engine problems I don t like the map I cannot accept that a company with so big open cashflow still don t give us the possibility to customize the games But maybe you are another kind of gamer So if you have time and money test this gameI am suggesting to play CS GO if you search for a new multiplayer shooter Yes there are also cheaters But the chance of having a cheater belong 5 opponents is way lower than having a cheater belong 99 opponents Also CS GO is providing many more gamemodes It is customable There is way less RNG The beginning is hard but it s worth all effortThanks for reading
Dear Mr Pubg this game sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE fix yo LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Hackers galore
F   NG THE BESTITS H1Z1 BUT THE DEVS CARE AND FINISH THE GAMEFORTNITE SAW HOW THIS WAS REALLY GOOD AND HOW IT WAS MAKING MONEY AND MADE A RIPOFF WITH NO CARS A SMALL MAP AND TOO POWERFUL GUNS AND TOO MANY AND THEY ADDED THE MOST UNFAIR THING BUILDING I MEAN YOU WILL GET CAMPED SO MUCH THAT YOULL CRY AND THEN PEOPLE WILL JUST HAVE RANDOM TRAPSPUBG YOU DA BESTEVERYONE SAYING PUBG IS BAD OVIOUSLY NEVER PLAYED THE GAME
what a steaming pile of dog LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I enjoyed this game a lot but then I got into fortnite and now I don t find it as fun as I did when I first started playing it
Solo duo or squad doesn t matter which mode you play it s alway awesome PS Minimal references are to understate in my opinion
The game is riddle with chinese hackers at all levels of the leaderboards from bottom 50  to top200 ranked The devs refuse to ping lock China and would much rather just keep banning cheaters every month or two so they can keep selling copies of the game SAD
This used to be a pretty fun game But due to the developer  turning this game into some sort of sjw experiment it is currently beginning to fail This game is a first person shooter and players should have to maintain a certain level of ping in order to be competitive with other players The current number of Chinese players playing in the North American server are hands down destroying this game through their ridiculously high ping which give them a Competitive Edge Then there s the white elephant in the room that 90 something percent of cheats out there originate in China and are used by the Chinese players Pubgs Creator knows all of this but is unwilling to upset his cash cow which is China and uses sjw self righteousness as a Smokescreen to allow Chinese players to play on in North America at our player base s expense All in all this used to be a great game and in the future I would advise anyone to avoid anything that this developer touches unless you just like being milked for dollars
DIED DUE TO BEING STUCK BETWEEN 2 ROCKS GOT STUCK FLOATING THIS IS BS THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO REPORT THESE ISSUES
Fun to play with the new optimizations and map worth a try if not a purchase
this game is just awesome i watched a lot of videos and buyed it i played for 2 hours now and im enjoying it i surrely recommend it to you guys
pubg Hello I wanted to inform you about the ceter who killed me I write you the name please I beg you to take care of his name yummyduixiang
Let me start with saying this is my first review I loved this game when it first came out hand loads of fun playing alone and with friends However with recent updates monetizing the cosmetic lootboxes in such a greedy way is just unacceptable I refuse to pay 250 for a dirty white tank top
Its a really good game but there should be a sanbox setting where its just you and you can spawn ant car andor gun and any item in the game and there should be a setting where  depending on the region you selectid you can play with people that speak the same language a really good game i do recommend
Region lock China or I will enjoy watching this game dieEDIT  This game is getting worse I love it but it s becoming unbearable ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS DESYNC CITY FIX THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GARBAGE
Fun game to play if you got friends Unlike me D  feelsbadman
Game is broken too many cheaters unlucky could be a nice game
good game but here are more cheaters than in cs go
Hardly to see cheaters anymore good job everyone Love the game
My friend told me to get this game so we can play togetherEver since then i have a blastThis game is hard as hell but also very interesting and funOnly con for me is optimization and some minor bugs but nevetheless this game is worth to buy
Had been playing this game before released After fully released the game just crashed oftenly as they like Or hackers much And why is there shotgun even in the game
great game do recommend
non communicable team mates
Pretty fun and addicting game third person in NA is infested with hackers and chinese players Kills it if you are trying to playing solo
I was playing pubg in a computer shop that has pre installed the game It was a 1v1 situation and i had the high ground because it was SEA and i had a ghillie costume and a bush it was the last circle and we me and the other had a lull monent because i was hiding in the bush and he was hiding in a side of a house I waited for like 1 min 30 seconds until something happened The computer turned off You heard that right not the game but the computer I turned on the pc with anger in my heart I tried opening pubg and it didnt open again It was stuck loading like wtf The game can be improved and i had fun with it  D But please fix that I was about to get my first chicken dinner D   i played for 47 hours only
I dont nie ehm me dont loading pubg
I just traded 700 bp and mind you thats on the cheap end you can get these LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  crates for some god dam school shoes you wana know the best part I ALREADY OWN A PAIR OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  SCHOOL SHOES THANKS PUBG The exchange rate is 30 bp LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ASS GAME TAKE YOUR BUTT PLUGS OUT AND FIX IT
i love how every big title comes out and everyone says its going to be great but then it isint and it gets meh reviews well the only thing that is true about that sentance with this game is that it gets meh reviews this game is great i cant recomend it enough
Too many hackers just dont buy it Spend your money on fortnite oh wait that game is free and has a better anticheat software
a very good game by no small countbut     the amount of very very easy to spot aimbot hackers wall hacks etc is starting to take its toll on enjoyment and the company approach is    well this particular group of peoples understanding of what hacks do to a game is different to everyone elses so instead of reigon locking them to their servers or CSGO style ping level disconnections or even adjusting it Overwatch style so known hackers can only game with other known hackers we re just going to let them do what they want and call everyone else copping the result degrading names while doing nothing to fix it  social justice kills companies sadface

I can t play squads without being teamed up with chinese teammates that dont speak english IN AN NA SERVERWould I reccomend this game  No The servers are swarmed with chinese people and hackers
Extremely bad de sync issues killed while behind cover and an extreme amount of hackers from China
DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEIts geting worse with every new updateThere is no anti cheat at all Servers overloaded constant lag and bugs that are in the game from begining Plus new ones with new updates1 in 4 players is cheatingThey baning 100k cheaters a week and same 95k cheater buing game back same dayOnly winer Bluehole sold another 95k for same cheaters75  of players are from China and they can join any server around the world they like DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME EVER GET BETHER
FIX YOUR F   ING GAME We can t play for an hour without one crash I paid 40 for that sh t
Bad Game To many people running around without shoes
this is the last straw everytime i try to load this game or play it always opens 3 TABS OF THE GAME AND I CANT EVEN PLAY DUE TO LAG this has been going on for ages now and im done do not install
In all honesty it s a fun game with a lot of issues It runs fine on most systems though I have noticed random FPS drops at times  GTX 960 w i7 7700K the recent updates have made the game look a bit nicer so that s always an added benefit While the game is fun for a very long time eventually the hype does die out and so does the want to play it Bluehole really does have thing that they need to address and fix soon otherwise I can see this game dying out soon much like it has for myself Being shot in the head by laggy players when you jump into cover is never fun having a bike hit a small mole hill then go crazy flinging around isn t fun I honestly hope to return to this game in a few months and see that it s issues have been fixedOverall I don t regret the 219 hours I ve spent playing this game with friends I ve enjoyed the time but it s just died out on me
Has potential to be a good game but the Bluehole managers consistently focus on the things that don t matter and ignore the game breaking bugs and de sync that are making me uninstall this game as we speak This game is in no way worth 60 It wouldn t be worth it if they had even fixed the unprofessional  duh  bugs like the home menu breaking every other time you load in or the matchmaking button not working every other time you use it or the random error messages that give you absolutely nothing to work with or even the fact that I can sit there in game and pick up the same item 10 times without it ever actually being picked up Don t waste your time go play another game in the same genre that actually has a manager who knows how to prioritize
I HAVE VIDEO OF PEOPLE CHEATING AND HACKING HE HAD A MAP AND IT SHOWED WHERE HIS ENIMIES WAS HOW DO I SEND TO THE CREATERS ISTANLEY1229GMAILCOM
it says that is not cooked or something like thatso i can t play it what can i do 
Fun game with friends
I like the game over all It s a nice game but I don t see why so many asian people have to come take over other regions Really hard to actually play a squad game when matched with 3 chinese that can say 3 words in english and only play by themselves Untill they do something about that I can t recommend this game
negative untill they improve performanceI have a brandnew 1600 gaming laptop  I buyed this laptop only because of this game and its fitting the recommended systemrequirements very well and I cant properly play the game I already play at low settings  and tried much to improve performance and cant get over 60fps with drops to 30  Lags and rubber bandingI m usually good at games not hereseems like u need a nasa pc to be competitive in this game
current very real version of the game  joining duo lobby zero friends so hope for an american   stuck on loading screen still can hear everything and now in plane   my duo is screaming at me in chinese   i say  toni ma  as best as i can to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  him off   now being yelled at randomly press f and drop meanwhile blind and can only see the loading screen  i hear myself hit the ground run around frantically for a bit  finally the black loading screen disappears and i happen to have dropped right by PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i  start running to PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i teammate is looting  i run into a building find crap  teammate runs over to my building gets shot at on the way  loses hp now running into my building and starts mumbling random chinq nese  slowly getting louder whips out shotgun and aims it at my face  i have nothing just some attachments random ammo and an energy drink  i obviously dont have a gun or anything so i drop the energy drink  he gets even louder shoots me loots my body and teabags me  devs please region lock
This is the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
this game after updates still rubberbands and here and there runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but it helps me understand how my mom and dad felt when they were addicted to rubbing their bodies against my cousinpure addictionthis game blows but buy it haHAA
The improvments this game has gotten are few and far between  It s broken choppy and the servers lag all the time  And now they re suing Fornite for copying their game type it appears as though even though they ve sold  40 MILLION copies they still want more money and only care about fortite and adding in microtransactions  These devs have disgraced themselves and no longer deserve their success
I m playing this till dayz is released
really fun manliy due to the comunity that has evoled with the game and its proxemity chat dont get me wronge the game has grate core machanics and is pretty well optemized at this point the controls feel nice and so does the shooting and coustum match making will always find a way to mix things up from the norm
Good game But needs South African servers   
   goodbay
One of THE BEST BATTLE ROYALE GAME 
This game has alot of bugs This game needs a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of work It s a TRASHY game No one and a repeat No one should ever pay 30 something dollars on this game its exactly like dayZ a dying game that will never be worked on because the develepors are too f   ing lazy Everyone take your asses to fortnite BR   Battle Royale its free and is a great Battle royale to play very colourful and well besides the point neveeer eveeer play this terrible terrible terrible game Have a great day everyone  
If you have friends then this is a very good game   talking about squads are better than solo s If you don t then I can imagine it becoming very boring
When only 1 person out of 100 wins each game there tends to be a lot of rage and salt Especially if you re bad at the game This I suspect is the case with half the reviews who are people who make excuses for their performance Anyways on to the review like most games especially fps games there s hackers desync issues etc But it definitely isn t a bad game because of it And in the long run this shouldn t make the game unenjoyable for you I recommend it because of how strategic you have to be while playing What I mean is how you act according to the situation that match gives you Do you rush somebody or wait for them  Which building or hilltop do you take  What weapon or attachments  Should you take a car or go on foot  These are only a few questions out of the hundreds you ll be asking yourself  or teammates every match And the more you play the easier the answers will be and the more games you ll win After over 500 hours I still enjoy it and so do the people I play it with This game has come a long ways and unlike so many others it s getting constantly updated and improved weekly So if you re the impatient gamer I ll tell you not to waste your time And if you want to win everytime you won t but that s part of the game
this game is very challenging
Game was great during the early access but now with the insane influx of Chinese players don t expect the game to last long I remember the last MMORPG I used to play a long time ago Shadowbane they flooded into that game and totally destroyed the game with cheating and flooding the servers Ubisoft ended up shutting down the servers for good Have a feeling this game will end up the same way Devs are too cash hungry to ban CN from the servers they will just milk the game and eventually give up on the game
hello battlegrounds is veri big crash
The game seriously needs to have a much more better anti cheat system If you can t give us that please region lock China I know there are thousands of  good  Chinese players but it seems like the a holes and cheaters outnumber them 10 1 Even though I still enjoy playing I wouldn t recommend it  right now  The lag the Chinese friendly fire  Yes they will kill you and other non Chinese team mates and take your guns and ammo and lastly the Chinese cheaters who are destroying the gameplay especially during moments where there s only 15 players left Last night a guy shot me and 4 other players just by firing his ump9 randomly from about a kilometer away No scope no line of sight 4 bullets 4 headshots
Dont buy it until they add region locking not worth playing against cheaters 80  of the time
I d really love to give this game a thumps up but this is not the case With just 45 hours I got TONS of fun alone or with friends funny innofensive bugs great kills roadkills fails But HALF my games are fu ed up with random crashes as if I altf4 and quit the game My rig aint a problem at all and tried in several computers Reconnecting is a solution but if playing in squad my mates dont see my squad member indicator dont see my marks cant revive me Never a sale full of bugs fixes that bring more problems that those it solve Disrespectful attitude towards the players
why dont you make your trash game playable
This game have it s potencial but since every 2nd3rd player is a fckn cheaterglitcher the whole game just doesn t make any sense Shame on you devs after having 400 million dollars you can t even invest a few bucks on a real cheat protection
This game is leet
Absolute Trash game 1010 game nothing works 1 on steam would not recommend to anyone who doesnt already have AIDs However Unboxed 250 skin makes life worth living Overall 410
This game had and still has a lot of potential to be something better than it isThese are some of the reasons i keep playing despite the negative reviewFluid and strong gun play and movement mechanics   althought a little buggyIntense gameplay really brings me back to the Dayz mod for Arma 2 and it s rare that any game has made me feel thatExcellent weapon variety although SMG s shotguns and pistols are completley useless passed 3 minutesContinued support The devs are going to keep adding more maps and variety into PUBG   hopefullyDespite these prosThere are a lot of consFor a finished game it s incredibly buggy and poorly optimized STILLThere is a plauge of cheaters It s uncommon to find a godlike auto aiming through the mountains insta killer but it happensMost cheaters are more insidious than thatThey use wall hacks auto aim sound boosters instant healing the list goes on these are harder to detect but its in about every single gameThe spectator option is still broken along with the death cam so if you wanted to find out if the person who killed you was cheating you have to question if it wasn t just PUBG s buggy inconsistancyI want to reccomend this game its truly fun when it can be butToo many hackers absolute crap loot boxesPING LOCK SERVERS OR AT LEAST REGION LOCKOther developers have figured this out why can Bluehole    
It s great when it works But it hardly ever works
Boring and its the same thing each game with terrible physics Devs that dont care about its fan base and has added a cratekey system just to get even more money they dont care about people from other reigons coming to the NA servers and gaining an upperhand due to thier high ping
Need more server and block china I dont recommend untill china will be blocked cant understand what they warbling about
After Update FPS dropped from  120 down to 40 45
Fix the rubberbanding and region lock ChinaRegardless it is fun and kills time and thats what I expected from a thirty dollar title
This game is fun but the devs think way to highly of themselves Game is filled with bugs and hackers Probably will die in a few years But overall its fun

1010 would get blown up by redzone again The game is very competitive and a huge adrenaline rush There are so many aspects to this game that create a need for skill and improvments You need to be sneaky listen predict drop distance and speed It is a lot of fun to play solo or with your friends
ANY SEVRER ANY TIME MANDARIN AND CANTONESE ONLY IT DOESN T MATTER IF IT S EU NA AU DOESNT MATTER ONLY ASIAN SPEAKERS HERE TRUST ME THEY RE READY TO VOMIT THEIR CHINESE POORLY CONTRUCTED INSULTS AT AMERICANS
It s sucks  I didn t use any hacks then I got banned I sent mail to PUGB about banning problem I got nothing BAD SERVICE DIDN T SOLVE MY PROBLEM
This game is really fun and worth it I enjoy this game very much its really improved I m seeing less lag and I ve never seen a cheater so don t sorry about them hackers Didnt they ban over 100000 cheaters  This game really pumps me up and it feels so nice to win If you re looking into this game and seeing if you should buy u really should
just runs really bad it ll say out of vram even when i have a gtx 970 with 35gb of fast and 05gb of slower vram thats just one of the many many game breaking bugs get fortnite it s free
I ve played this game on my brother s computer and I love it Although don t buy this game unless you have a very fast computer or an Nvidia graphics card I have since deleted this game after notiving it is basically unplayable after 5 hours of gameplay Overall this game is recommended if you have the right computer and graphics card I unfortunately was unable to refund this game and lost a good 30 I don t want y all to suffer the same fate and that is why I have written this review
6810 Now Let me Start off by saying  that this is a good game but has it fair share of problems Such as crashing constantly bugs up the Wazzoo and the 13 billion chinese users that bombard all the other servers specifically  the oceania and north america and some have such bad connection that they can be all ready dead and kill you but when the western playerbase says  We Would Like Regionlock  Brendon Greene says  xenophobia has no place in my community 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game doesnt even work LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fix it we have been trying to start a game for like 20 minutes and it just doesnt LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing work please brendan LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE y kys
Started playing this game in June last year I love this game and have spent a lot of my time playing it However there are two major issues with this game that turn me against it 1   The Chinese Every single server is dominated by the Chinese  This means you CANNOT play with randoms unless you like playing with people who don t speak your language and therefor cannot assist you in actually getting a chicken dinner  win  Along with the Chinese s lack of good communication skills comes my second issue2    CHEATING  It really seems like at least half of the matches you play you end up running into a cheater  I know this because the game has a deathcam programmed into it which allows you to see your death through their perspective  I can t tell you how many times I ve been killed by some guy with numbers as a username who somehow manages to land every shot from 300 meters without even aiming down the sights  Until the producers of this game decide to fix these two issues I would avoid buying this game as it will just bring you more frustration than fun
this game is still full of script 9 out of 10 game you play there is scripter And yet pubg do anothing update scripte friendly dont buy this game useless fu1cking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
Got chased for half an hour by a man with a Hatchet
Great Game You should buy it unless you have a bad computer
I worked hard on my account 5 years worth of screenshots stats that Ive built up account bound items Ive acquired rare badges Ive collected the friends the connections Ive made and now its been LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on by these 3 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE  hole developers  BlueHole PUBG and Battleye Who don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about their player base  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Every claim of a false positive ban is met with a  We can assure you that the account was blocked because there was a violation discovered on the account My apologize but we cannot provide any specifics on the details of the violation  and the claimer is likely ignored and forgotten but PUBG and Bluehole have to realize that Battleye DOES have false positive hits  a lot because hackers engineer them and innocent people really are losing not only very expensive overpriced game keys but also get their extremely expensive in game inventories blocked Without these people being famous YouTubers or Streamers their claims are ignored by everyone including the very people who work on these anti cheat software IF anyone does We have seen this before with major YouTuber  anomaly   Video  WE DID IT  Update Video   Anomaly   June 11 2014 and streamer DrDisrespect When they got a  false positive  ban all they do is send a Tweet or post a video and its sorted by tomorrow and the problem isn t fixed let alone acknowledged Quite frankly it s disgusting
Fun but very buggy at times
The game is really badWhy A lot of cheatersNew trade ban CS GO trade RIP and the trade of this game will be RIP ed tooI DO NOT reccommend this game because  the developers go by CS GO way and it means the game will be dead soon
I hope you like holding w and shift
graphics and ram memory does not support from my computer
Good and interesting game but too many bugs
Waste of moneyTerrible performanceIncredibly bad and frustrating gameplayHorrible netcodeUnequal distribution of lootRandom hangs and crashes  bad_module_info has stopped working BYEBYEChinese playing on EU serversGet this game if you want to have gray hair at age of 20Too bad I can t refund it  would have gotten Papers Please or something instead
   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE        
It is a fun game after you get the hang of it Starting out can be hard when there is no seperation between skilled players and unskilled players Otherwise it is a great battle royale and best played with friends
This game is the best battle royale when u play is obvious that the game is not finhis yet  has a lot of bugs and lag sometimes but if they optimizate correctly they will have one of the best games of the year
its pretty fun i havent seen one hacker in first person games but there are some in third person
The simplified battle rayel mechanism gave the game the magic to grab the love of the players and streamers But we are facing the fact that Blue hole is making completely no progress on making this a better game Just like our beloved shroud have said  tarkov is going up and up while pubg is literally going no where I get bored about the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server I grew tired of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  shooting and I just want to quit this giant pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a moment unless blue hole is willing to show some effort
only hackers
Without question   the worst written piece of software I ve ever happened acrossSingle GPU   or SLi this game runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE And when you do endure multiple restarts of it to force it to actually run the  feel  or  mechanics  of in game fighting  shooting just don t play out well I d rather have toothacheThe demands on both CPU   GPU make me wonder who has a system out there that runs this wellI say to you honestly   don t believe the hype  as I did this is pure and utter garbageAm I noob to gaming  Nope over 5 thousand hours in FPS games and I don t think I have yet killed a single opponent in the 72 mins the counter tells me I ve play forPlease save your money and buy ANY other gamePeace out
This game is very fun but have a lot of problemsPros Tactical shooting  Very excited Better Graphic Better soundCons Badly optimize  You need GTX Titan V Pascal with Core I9 to run this game 60fps in ultra A lot of chinese hackers A lot of toxic  More than CSGO and Dota2  Most are chinese A lot of bugs Not beginner friendly Badly airdrop system  How airdrop dropped on the roof but you can t get there  If you like tactical competitive games and you have friends to play with i very recommend But if you not ignore this game
Game crashes when picking up stuff repeatedly lag is unbelievable compared to any other gameI don t understand what s the hype with this game
This game is plagued with cheaters the netcode is horrid and if you re on a low end pc or got a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  processor  good luck loading in before being kicked from the plane PLEASE PUBG DEVS IF YOU READ THIS REGION LOCK CHINA FFS THEY ARE A PLAGUE ON NA SERVERS
Every time I saw the enemy my heart beats fast and my hands is sweating x D Satisfying every kills you earn and intense
This is quite a long review but please read it if you are on the fence about whether or not to purchase this gameThis game is not finished Not at all And it won t be finished for a long timeThis game crashes more than a Unity asset flip assembled by a 13 year old in half an hour It has more rubber banding than a rubber band factory It has worse hit detection than any other game I ve ever played The physics are laughably bad like something from 2007 1997 not 2017The maps range from bad to good More specifically there is one good map and one bad map Yes this product that has quickly become one of the fastest selling games of all time has only two maps One map has a decent amount of terrain types and is well designed  Erangel and the other map is 3 times as large as it needs to be and is boring as all hell  MiramarThat is not to say there is nothing good about this game It has decent shooting mechanics with somewhat accurate bullet drop and travel times It also has good sound design which helps to make up for the terrible graphics You will also experience some very tense moments that will leave you heart poundingThis would all be acceptable if the developer  currently the unimaginatively named PUBG Corp formerly a team at Bluehole entertainment was an independent studio with few resources but that is the exact opposite of the developers situationPUBG Corp is a corporation with deep pockets and a large development team so the fact that there are so many problems that haven t been fixed leads me to believe that the devs are perfectly happy to take our money and never fix the horrendous issues PUBG suffers fromI rate this game overall 6810TL DR The game is still in a buggy state despite the developer have a large amount of resources that they could devote to the further development of the product Do not buy this game if you want a decent experience buy it if you want to have a small amount of fun inbetween large amounts of anger and disbeliefEDIT  Since writing this review I ve been killed by multiple chinese hackers unfortunately I hate to say this but PUBg Corp really needs to implement a region lock for chinese players The problem isn t that all chinese players are hackers it s that they all flood the NA servers for some reason meaning that there isn t an even distribution of hackers NA players have to deal with NA hackers plus chinese hackers which isn t fair nor enjoyableAnd once again for emphasis it s not like every chinese player is a hacker it s just that the distribution of hackers is all out of wackI d rather that everyone was free to play on whatever servers they wanted to but that s not possible due to the current hacking problems this game hasIf PUBg Corp were to implement a region lock or just double their efforts to rid the game of these hackers I d bring my rating of this game back up to the original or maybe higherIn its current state I d rate it 510
Simply s h i t with friends less s h i t but always s h i t
PUBG is a great game that has already come far from where it started The game was getting even better and I was having a lot of fun playing it However after the release of this game in China the game has become nearly unplayable The OC servers are only filled with the laggy Chinese who can t speak English and who cheat all the time Even Bluehole released the statistic that  98  of the cheaters are from China Unless Bluehole can RegionLockChina this game will end up like H1Z1  A Good game that is now dead due to the hacking Chinese This game is worth the buy if you are willing to deal with people who come onto your server can t speak your language cheat and team kill If you can t deal with that do not buy this game Bluehole needs to listen to the players that love this game because it has so much potential This game is going to start dying even faster if they do not RegionLockChina or BanChina
The situation with this game really needs to be observed and studied by social psychologist around the world maybe they can understand teenagers of this era this wayThree LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing million idiots play this game concurrently on weekends  including myself and get frustrated by the poor mechanics of it and bad gameplay experience and still cant quit playing there are some serious design principle flaws in it and still 3 million LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing players I really dont know whats going on in this world  DEdit  So far lots of issues have been adressed so its not a mess anymore  D
This is one of the most garbage games I have ever encountered all kinds of bugs all kinds of mental retardation Put the test suit aside move all the updates to the formal service test and finally add a word of heart  I wish the PUBG better
Addictive game is addictive

This game is tons of fun with friends and has HUGE potential but It s currently being let down by a failure to understand it s biggest issues and victim blamingWith the release of the 10 update PUBG suddenly became overrun with hackers high ping players and non English speaking players which by the game creator s own admission come mostly from China 99  of these high ping players and hackers are Chinese due to the ability for these players to play on the Western servers rather than their ownNow these issues are very well known amongst the community Mentioning this to a regular player will not be news to them Unfortunately that is not the case with Brendan Greene the game s creator When he noticed the hate towards the Chinese gaming community and the obvious issues plaguing his game he instead decided to blame the dedicated players who felt that things needed to change He claimed those criticizing the lack of changes were nothing but xenophobes that their criticisms stem only for their supposed hatred of Chinese people Of course it would be ignorant to discard the blatant racism some players do throw the way of these Chinese players and I m sure some players are truly xenophobic but pinning the blame of the game s own shortcomings on the loyal fans supporting it is not fixing anything Who could possibly enjoy playing against those who can turn a corner and kill you before you even see them and play with players who don t even speak your language in a game where communication is key  Not to mention those who can cleanly headshot you from 500 meters with a pistol It just isn t funI truly hope that these issues are fixed soon and Brendan Greene doesn t continue to be ignorant about these issues so that we can once again enjoy playing in the BATTLEGROUNDS
Region lock the damn chinese They are 99 percent of the cheaters in the game I have played several games just today where I have been killed by presumably chinese or korean players  based on name that have snapped to my head  some without even ADS This isn t a finished product at all Please if you haven t bought the game wait Wait until the developers stop playing the racist card and actually do something about the increable cheating problem and region lock issues Asian players playing in Asian countries should be locked to those areas of the globe  same as western players to their area of the world Because of this horrid cheating problem I am having a hard trusting players who kill me The community will die if the developers do not remedy these problems
This game might as well be the baby of EA and Activitsion whom is a defiant child  and worse Thats all you need to know to understand how poorely this game was built You are far more likely to hate this game then like it  This game has an endless list of problems from hacking to being stuck under a truck because you ran to close seriously that happened this morning  and this game is out of early access basically this game is all first impressions and thats it It is only a matter of time before another game company releases a better version of this game and this game will be dead I know this is a very opnionated review but its hard to see this game in another way this game is only still alive because of popular streamers all it takes is streamers to stop playing this games hype will die  
Really fun and challenging game fantastic game to play with friends Would recommend 55
Crap game waste of money Sound is terrible
BEST GAME
Good game but ffs  atleast once a day i got freez screen and i cant move with my carachter i spend 30 euros to play not to exit and then i played solo and couldnt get back in the game dieing or dmging myself on invisible rock stop it and fix those things i paid to play not to exit all the time from games beacuse of stupid things
can t play one LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing round without chinese cheaters  the game is good but don t buy it unless the damn dev s sort out the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chinese cheater problems  i feel sorry for all the non cheating chinese out there
Pretty fun game but its also pretty broken doesnt matter how fast you can land the parachute will LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you over 910 times
Cheaters from China are ruining everyone s games don t bother until they get their heads out of their asses with region locks
Loading Screen SimulatorThe game itself runs smooth as babies arses but i cant handle being dropped at the edge of the map hearing everything and stuck at that loading screenA tip  Dont waste your money in that crap until they fix that if you feeling that you gonna have the same problem
nice game  DDD
H1Z1
i want so badly to give this a thumbs up but i cant the game is amazing dont get me wrong but litterally i have yet to play a single game in the last month were  i dont run into someone hacking  glitching if it wasnt for the hackkers i would only have 1 complaint and that would be that half the brush and all the grass dont load after about 40 yards so when you think your hidding cuz you got good brush coverage a sniper sees you plain as day
As a ordinary chinese player when I see those pages and pages of  Region lock china  I feel nothing but ASHAME We are suffering from cheaters too as all of you do I never said a word or retort those player from other countries who cures me just becouse I am from china becouse I know discrmination always comes with a reasonBut believe me no matter how you and us wish and what you an us said it will not make any difference of theose cheaters becouse they dont have any sence of justice at all and will keep destroying this game we once loved so thats why I dont recomend this game anymoreshouting china no1noob 
I like being killed by aimbot by a chinese gookChina 110
Gameplay is still to improve a lot grafics are ok lag is still an issus
Challenging game love it
PlayerCheaters Battleground
I don t reccomend playing this game on anything thats not a GTX graphics card thats a 900 series or newer It makes the game very difficult and gross looking People get very butthurt because their computers cant handle the game and in turn makes it hard Its a good game It requires lots of patience and skill Those of you who lack the skill part should just go play fortnite
lol this game has hackers
Meanwhile North American Servers all I hear is Ching chong chang Region lock required for this game
Let me first start out saying that this by far one of the best games of 20172018 if you can look past the cheating Unfortunately this is almost impossible to look past when cheating is either seen or experienced during EACH match While I do see the developers doing their due dilligence with new reporting tools etc I don t understand why they refuse to region lock the game as nearly every cheater I ve seen or been killed by had been Chinese Beyond the stereotypes and racism seen in the lobby clearly there is a reason why a lot of people chant  build the cyber wall Once the cheating is even mildly controlled better or they implement a region lock will I change my recommendation because at the moment they make the game  unplayable 
This LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  sucks
MAKES ME WET
M16 no x8 scope M4ScarAK x8 scope wpDying headshot behind containers rocks trees wpAnti Cheat technology  0 Replays client based not server based so if you lag you ll never know the truth wpFootsteps are heard like 30 meters wp even if you crouch wpYou can t just put your hands out of the window and spray someone underneath And finally the guy in cover is more vulnerable than the guy running and jumping in the middle of the map  which rapes the concept of realistic even when someone is ambushing and sneaky and the other guy just running up the stairs the guy running has the advantage of dodging bullets hahahahaAnd all that in FPP TPP is a laugh ppl dancing chicken dance in front of a container no one daring to attack the guy in front of himBut the concept is good the developers are working on it so it s fine but i vote down for now

Well it was fun at first I haven t played much myself but I watch PUBG videos a lot I even bought it for my brother  so I spent about 6000 on this game I got out of it for a while and wanted to get back in Then I saw the micro transactions and how they completely ruined their game flustered and tying to make a comeback against Fortnite It really felt like I was let down and I truly regretted giving my brother such a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game for his birthday Complete waste of money I am not even going to think about playing until they remove micro transactions and bring back trading Until then screw this trashpile of a game I have 60 other games I would rather play
please BAN CINA

It used to be fine but now every 2nd death i have its because of a hacker it really breaks it for me when a game that is so fun just turns to crap so quickly I will still play it but please for the whole community dont update maps dont update arsenal dont update anything work on reducing the amount of hackers please
the game is glitchy at some times but this isnt the full realese yet so it might get better but i the gameplay is amazing so i can get over the few bugs it has overall i love the game and think you should get it i know that a lot of people ay it is to glitchy and to hard but it isnt the full release yet this is now one of my favorite games now that i got it
why the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  are there asians in the oceania server  wtf
horrable game in which the adminsgms what ever you wanta call them ban people for killing streamersworst coin i ever spent was on this garbage thats up its own LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I keep dying to cheaters This is no fun The game was great until it was flooded with cheaters Not worth playing anymore
Horrendous optimizationCrammed full of bugsItems in the market that cost over 1500Chinese hackers on every serverLiteral children screaming as loud as they can on micMaps so large you can spend 15 minutes looking for someone to shoot then die instantly10 Release
can i not take damage when i land thanks
Have had so much fun and still have fun playing this game
Game is out of  Early Acces  and still has no bullet penetration on their stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing barred windows There is a growing number of hackers with no sign of any ways to stop them on Bluehole s part D sync is a given every game
This used to be a great game now it is over ran with hackers Maj fps drops Network lag They keep adding new content befor fixing what is already in the game and broken
Tops
XD
Hackers in every game lol cant play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
It s very bad optimized
  China numba 1  
Good game to buyplay
The game itself is fun but regular 6 gig updates are making me wish I didn t get this game  Surely fixes should be done a few at a time so as not to impact end users   Why do I feel I m completely re installing the whole game every few weeks It wouldn t be so bad if the updates were optional but of course you can t play on a network with an old version of the game
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game so much lag hackers everywhere
The game is a good game with that said it is unplayable in its current state unless you find a website to purchase the cheats players are constantly using They can see where you are and how many meters you are away from them 70  use this cheat but currently the aimbotters and people shooting you from across the map by just shooting into the air and not even at you makes the game unplayable  so you spend 10 15 minutes looting buildings simply to have a cheater shoot and kill you that you can t even see and he can t even see you This game is dead they can t stop the cheating and won t ban the accounts with 25 kill to death ratio and all FPS players know this is impossible without cheating
There are to many chinesse people on the NA server if you play squads there is like a 10 percent chance you will get someone that speaks english
Ehh
Yes very good game Yes Recommed this game Yes
Ok game Lots of bugs but lots of fun
It s the same thing over and over and over and over endlessly It s not fun it s basically just an overhyped fad                                    
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
First you have a cheating problem which is just part of the Chinese problem I don t mind playing with Chinese players but they cheat and they treat the game badly They are loud and obnoxious in the waiting area and on the plane so much so that I have to totally disable voice communication The cheating is obvious why not pay money and use a better anti cheating system I rarely see cheaters in BFBC2 and I played that for a while but we had to use Punk Buster I understand that Chinese players are what gives you numbers but you aren t going to increase numbers this way you have already saturdated the Chinese market and other markets aren t going to jump onboard if all they hear is yelling followed by being shot in the head from the other side of the map in 23 games I have had good games with some Chinese guys and I don t mind the loud obnoxious open voice thing but i can t stand the cheating Somtimes I feel like grabbing a microphone and yelling  China 2 Taiwan 1  but I don t mainly because i think half of them would turn their cheats on Also your shooting mechanics seem to be broken half the time
so  bad
Dear playerunknown I think that you are the laziest person on the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing planet Why would you make a new map where only 2 places are woth going to There is no midgame and the redzone is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t just like your existence Please let me only play on the old map for the love of god and anime
region lock is needed I am fluent in mandarin
Great game for the first few hours but it gets boring quickly due to inconsitancies in gameplay I would love to see region lock In my opinion this game needs alot of refinement so I can t recommend it until that happens
Hackers Cheaters aimbots character location mods recent 88 GB update and has no visible changes  actually feels worse  this game should still be in beta testing  and for the love of Gawd region lock the area  Fix the game instead of releasing a bunch of useless grips that dont work  And fix the sight mechanics Its totally off  Hiding behind a hill Looking through a scope shooting at an enemy just to see the dirt on the mountain in front of you getting hit  This game is broken I would not recommend  Unless youre a hacker then by all means feel free
when i first began this game it was in early access At the time the lag poor hit box random bullet spread and lack of true RNG was acceptable Now after the game released i think we all believed this game was going to be great finally finally optimized finally registering hits correctly cheating being taken care of Rewards for playing the game instead we got a semi optimized laggy non hit registering random hit points worse rng and now paid loot crates ever since the update came out the game has been ridiculous instead of fixing and dealing with cheaters blue hole wants more money from there fans without rewarding for winning or for having early access blue hole has taken a play book from epic and decided there fans no longer matter unless they are streamers or forking over all the money DO NOT BUY THIS GAME make blue hole fix this mess instead of getting away with this because they are a  new game  or it was just out of early accessUpdate  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game it literally crashes at least 2 to 3 times a day teleports you across the map for no reason has no care for making this game any better fix your god damn game
Absolute trash One big giant bug pretending to be a game Gunplay is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and makes no sense driving is a buggy nightmare hit regulation is a joke and the whole thing runs on a russian babushka s potato computer science project This game doesn t even deserve to be called a beta let alone a fully released gameDO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH
NIce graphic i enjoyed playing with my friends  
Laggy Af fun for a few rounds until you get into a gun fight and lost because they enemy is richer than you and have a better computer Rather play Roblox Phantom Force
Fun at first when playing with friends but this game is way too glitchy I have 3 death cam recordings two of people killing me without even aiming at me and one where I shot my gun then just stopped but on my screen I was shooting the crap out of the guy not to mention I had the jump on him I was wandering why he never died till i looked it the death cam replay I ve watched several random teammates either shooting beside or behind a person trying to get the shots to land and one teammate sent me his death cam footage of being headshot in one try while driving a vehicle buy a guy who appeared to be locked onto hes head
was   inside   a vehicle moving in a straight line and then we dead how   ran over self in vehicle 
Limit the ping you will be as rubbish as H1N1
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this buggy LOVE LOVE LOVE  game i got suck in the water i i cold not get out wtf this is a buuggy game with i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dev team
i lIke the game
this game is actually LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing horrible i d give a huge list stating why but you could easily find what i d say and more in other reviewsbut  bugs acceptable in alphabeta very prominent in a released product major desync and peeker s advantage no region lock NA servers invaded by high ping ching chongs micro transactions which would be acceptable since they re cosmetic but the game is clearly unfinished so they should be working on bugs rather than new content new map is unfinished and has bugglitch spots where you get stuck vehicles  ie three seater bike randomly fly into the air usually killing passengers or harming themliterally don t buy this game unless you have other people to play it with if not it gets incredibly boring and rage inducing due to it being unfinishedalso did i mention that this game is clearly unfinished 
This game is still riddled with bugs Game crashes so frequently at the most random times even after coming out of beta Needs a lot of work You think it is fun at first but the more hours you put into the more you realize it s just plain awful The bugs and the amount of chinese hackers you ll run into just makes the game not fun to play
Game will actually be recommendable and fun again when there are no chinese hackers that are trash at their own server so they come 2 NA with hacks to win For now this game is all about getting a gun and going with a mind set of dying to someone shooting at a tree across the entire map This game is turning into H1Z1 with all these hackers but atleast it s better looking REGIONLOCK KEEPTHECHINESEOUT DEVSARECHINESE If these hackers wanna feel so good about themselves they should just kill AFK s Nvm They d probaby be trash enough to die to 1 BATTLEYE
I purchased this and had a refund I played 3 sessions and this is the summary1 All games had rubber banding and extremem latency2 The third game I tried  which convinced me to refund I was shot in the head from 3 or 4 miles away while hiding inside a building  Someone was wall hacking A game that doesn t function  Lag and has issues clamping down on hacking  No thanks not at that price
Great game when it worksBarely two hours of play time under my belt of that two hours at least a hour and forty five mintes have been spent waiting for serversCurrently unplayable   
Fun when u don t get cheaters
THIS GAME IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  SO LARGE UPDATES BUT NOT DO SOMETHINGS THIS GAME AND SO MANY BUGS SOME TIMES  SERVER BUSY ERRORS I BACK TO PLAY CSGO AND OTHER GAMES I DONT LIKE THIS IF U PLAY SEA AND ASIA SO MANY CHINES HAKCERS PUBG IS SO RETARD GAME EVER 
Worst severs everRoutine server failure on Fridays
smile gateI was the first time I saw a game code so bad that the cheater modified the game modelA part of the player s passion for locking in China is beyond my expectation I can only useDamage the interests of others and preserve their own intereststo describe that youYou should be ashamed of your behaviorI believe that most Korean players are involved in this racist carnival As a descendant of the Chinese nation you should really correct your attitude rather than being a mindless person
This is the crappiest game i have ever played It sucks so much it is so so so buggy it should die
This game is fun but it needs a couple changes before I ever come backbelow is an in depth list1 Region lock China
too many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bluehole and hackerthis game is suck vote ban
All i say i can do is wow    
over run with asians so unless u speak chinese or are good at solo the team experience is completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed
game is pretty meh but I mean what else you going to do play fortnite
For starters I do enjoy this game This game is the start of a new game style It brings an open world to a TPS and FPS together The sniping is my favorite thing about this game Yes it s hard and if you are getting shot at it s hard to see where the shots are coming from But that s how it is in real life Battlefield does sniping no justice when ADS and there is a huge white dot of your exact location Yes that can happen but it is only when two sniper scopes are aiming right at eachother and they are in the sun I like how stealthy you can be One thing i dont like about the game is yes China over rules the NA servers What ever I play with my friends anyways Two is that yes there are hackers here than probably in any other game I think of it as a greater challenge but it does suck when you are down to the last 10 and the hacker does win Whipdido you won a game that you are cheeting at Want a cookie Three for when you just get really good loot then get ganged up on by another passing team But thats just the gameFour is for the lag I have at the begining of matches But I also have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  internet and a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PCThat is all I can really think of that turns me away from the game Overall if they can continue fixing the game and making it more optimized I think it will be a great game It just has some bugs with it but that s excpected If I were to recomend it to someone I would but with some warnings Beware of cheeters watch out for up coming groups and learn chinese
shot behinde rocks2shot from 150 meters away by ump or m16 even when i have full lvl3rubber banding is still a thingpeople have worse connection got the upper hand2999euro and still got problems
Bought this game because of the  looks like fun  Youtubes Iv seenFirst match I saw no one and died to being outside the ring  ranked 28Second Match Got some nice gear hide in building until was under 30 and needed to move to be in ring Aim bot cheater Scope Snipped me while he was running away from me  kill cam shows him snap around pop head shot through bushes keeps running opposite direct I was goingThrid game I get to 20 geting lucky the zone was where I was so found a nice sniping place guy comes up behind me not seeing me in teh bushes I change to Pump action Shotgun as he is like 5 ft away and aim at his head pull trigger shot twice he stands up and kills me  My HEAD Shots did zero damage to himUninstalled the game and got refund
Until release date everything was okay I started to love this game And then everything changed after release Now I can t jump where I want  in Solo Mode because I m always busy with reading loading screen text I want to do only one of two things To refund or to jump where I want to jump Unfortunately both is impossibleGameplay  710Sounds  910Graphics  610New issues after every update  1110
Excluding input lag hackers one sided fights absolute BS and horrible optimization this game is still magnificently LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I must have came at the right time because I ve had nothing but fun in this game since I bought it Yes there are bugs that need to be fixed but I have yet to run into anything game breaking If you play with friends it is some of the most fun you can have onlinePros   Tons of replayability  Option to go in heavy or play stealthy  Decent graphics  Getting into a game is very fastCons   Some graphical bugs  Can be hard to get used to weapons
PUBG is a game that you can play for hundreds of hours and still have a mixed responseIt is a game that really shows how battle royals should be made and a allow poeple to be rewarded for winning without them getting op It s a game that requires a lot of skill and knowledge to play and I reccomend itThe only bad things about this game are the fact that you can t run any backround programs while running it besides discord if you don t have a top notch PC
Region Lock
Fun game but the hacking is a real issue This game needs to be the best out there at preventing cheating because 100 players filter down to a handful and the hacker will likely survive to the end That makes the probability to encounter a hacker in 1v1 combat much more likely than in any other shooting game out there Experiencing a hacking encounter especially towards the end of the game is very demoralizing and makes playing the game a lot less fun I am frustrated with the hacking issue but I enjoy playing this game and reccomend it Perhaps console would be a better experience than pc in this case
 On my screen I m readied up 
Game is full of hackers grenades throw you acroos the map and kill you from falling also when you have level 3 gear it does noithing game is a waste of your time and money also people can hear you a mile away and through a rock face
bad serverafter update always cannot enter server pls fix server asap
shoooo guddddd
This game is not finished it souldnt even be on steam its that bad
Until something is done about the cheating there s no reason to play There s been cheaters in every single game and the death cam makes it all the more obvious
tidak bisa dimainkan di gv tapi oke game nya
Dont buy this game until they fix the parachuting
Its quite fun to play and gets pretty intense too in the end circlesDevelopors still need to focus on the rubberbanding and improve their serversAnd yeah dont forget the hacker real pain in the LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I bought this game and it wouldnt even let me play it just gave me an error message
It is worth owning
This Game is a work of art but at the same time I wanna flush it down a toilet Some Parts are broken like how you can get shot while in cover You can Flip your vehicle over a little dent in a field etc but most of that gets cancelled out by fun gun fights messing about with friends and riding on a motorbike doing backflips I would rate it a solid 82510
Complain about how bad the game s overall performace is fanboys with crush you to death
Absolute waste of time The game still plays like it is early acces there is no point buying this 30 game when you have fortnite The game is still super buggy half the tiem it does not load waste of time and money don t get it
Its a pretty Good Game after the optimization and yeah it fun and enjoyable if you have friends to play with
I love this game  even when you play Solo you can enjoy this game
My thoughts after PC Update 10 compared to the earlier builds of this game  Early Access   Framerate has vastly improved I average over 110fps with TextureAA on Ultra and everything else on medium  i7 2600k980ti16gb RAM  Overall lag has reduced  Replay system is convenient esp if you re not a content creator or don t use recording software  Can view replays of up to the last 20 matches played  Redesigned lobby and lobbysystem UI  There are now 2 maps that are randomly selected  new desert themed map  Vaulting  not clunky and feels great   Driving physics improvements  Driving offroad is noticeably different and imo enjoyable and adds to the imersion  There is now a Deathcam feature   Weapon   Ballistics improvements  Elements of UI has been drastically improved HUDUIMinimap have all been redesigned Slight improvement of detail on weapon thumbnailsWhile this BR has been in the rough for quite some time after this patch it has definitely been a great overall improvement There are some glaring issues though such as running into hackers occasionally  I ve only ran into a few hackers with my 500 hours of playing and from what I m noticing it seems more common in TPP mode low tick rate on servers and the lack of region lock Although those issues sound signifant the game is overall stable and I still recommend this game  even at full price especially if you have some friends to play with
After nerfing the ARs in the game every ARs does zero damage
You guys should make a dedicated server for ching chong people before they spread cancer in your gamePleaseand LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you Ling Ling
Online loot fest plagued by slow RE style inventory system More bugs to find than in a Superman 64 playthrough Worst 40 I ever spent right next to CoD AW Very efficient cashgrab Your favorite streamer plays the game so what more could you ask for  1010
Be meLast 2 in final circleSee last guy he s in voice chat yelling in chinese shoot him in the head he teleports behind me and kills meexit game uninstal 010 chinese ruined this game
Don t buy You ll get killed by a cheater 50  of the games PUBG used to be the best game of 2017 this is now the worst game of 2018 BECAUSE OF CHEATERS
I can t give this game a positive review and need I say why  My partner and I play consistantly and most matches are infested with hackers It s no fun to play at all with cheaters If I m going to die I want to die to a legitmiate and honest player who had good tactic or even by my own faults to an honest n00b not someone who is farming in order to sell oh loot goodies and keys The developers of PUBG obviously do not care about it s true clientel They promise changes and nothing happens It just gets worse This game is dying and Blue Hole is exploiting it to people who get  banned  and then buy another copy Those of us who legitimately play do not matter If this game weren t infested with hackers I would gladly recommend this game For now I m uninstalling I regret recommending this game to any of my friends Thanks for careing Blue Hole Oh and to those of you Westerners who keep saying you only get 110 matches with hackers you re probably a cheater yourself I d rather suck at a game but play honest than suck so much that I have to cheat How pathetic
This game used to be so much fun Ive played this game since the first day it was released but the DEVs have become lazy and the game is starting to feel like it was made by the same Devs has H1Z1 Blue is just a money pit
Things seemed fine before 2018 now there s a hacker in about 14 of your games if not more No fun they need to fix this
I am all for having everyone have a chance to play against equal skill people but please region lock whenever noon in china hits my game goes from being playable to being so laggy its almost nauseating I can provide proof of 1 game to another on the lag situation Please figure this out I love this game but between Chinese players coming and team killing non Chinese players or the ridiculous amount of lag whenever they switch servers please figure something out

made me buy crates game over man
Lag crash rng festNeed people with brains to copy this game so someone can make a playable version of it
Spent the entire match looting the outskirts and avoiding combatHug a bush in the final circleEnemies killed themselvesChicken dinner1010
What did you think updating the blue zone to what it is now  This really ruined the game
every day cheaters are more and bluehole do NOTHING to resolve the problemwaiting time is stupidworst online servers evercost 30 for no reasondont buy it play fortnite more fun less cheaters less waiting timefree
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  china
210 Game crashes mid battle and when you join again it just crashes again and thats the circle of life
1010 BABY
It is fine now that they finally allow you to pick the map you wanna play on However it would be nice if war mode was open to anyone and not only to their  exclusive club 
This Game its coolWorth IT
Fun and challenging for both you and your PC
When I got PUBG I wasnt able to run it with more than 3 fps with my computer that has 8gb of ram even tho it says 6gb of ram minimum PUBG is deffinitely not worth the 30 I think it should be 15 tops I would deffinitely recommend this game if you have a high quality computer and good internet Otherwise I wouldn t waste your time or money on this game
Did you know da wae 
Region Lock right now In South America servers we already have enough problems with Spanish countries vs Brazil and vice versa we don t need Chinese hack players to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  us of too
Continues to improve definitly worth getting a good headset
Cheaters in every roundWH AutoAim NoRecoil and etc in EVERY roundMOST CHEATERED game of the yearGo to youtube and you can check thisDONT waste your money
First and foremost  I think this is the best Battle Royale game out there right nowNow for why I m writing a poor review  today I jumped into the game baught a crate with BP AND WAS PROMPTED TO BUY A KEY TO GET MY HARD EARNED PIECE OF JUNK COSMETIC ITEM WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE BLUEHOLE  This isn t CSGO where your players expect to be ripped off Furthermore the fact that you have to earn the crate in the first place to then pay and open it is a slap in the face Some people I know would take some 10 matches to earn enough for 1 crate so the play time to loot ratio is unfair for most who want to have a good time and end up with something to show for the support they have given your gameSure the money is important but millions of copies sold isn t enough to give back a bit The gameplay is good and getting better with each update but I want to see a change in how developers handle microtransactions because when it locks off the sense of achievement then why should anyone play your game 
Cheaters most of games shoots you from another city just by walking why are you stupid matherfaks wasting my time also selling this for  40  I have played this game for more than 500 hours probs reported  more than 100 cheaters and no results about thjemU not blue hole matherfakkk u LOVE LOVE LOVE  hole
Good game consept gameplay is a little rough not a fan of the loot boxes but the thing thats bringing this game down right now are cheaters and a metric LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of lag is it because of the chinese people comming in to US servers from across the planet maby either way game is not worth your time right now may get better donno Mr brendan greene please understand that if you only follow the money your game will fall thank you for your time
This game has a lot of potential but there are still too many thing left unfinished and the netcoding is a messSo if you are thinking about buying this game for its full price Don t do it You will just regret later
In the Early Access the game was good but now they have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed everything up removing crouch jumping also removed the fast pasted plays that you could do in school and military base Now with vaulting you are dead once you press the vault button The new map is so bad me and my friend always leave until it s the old one Erangel
Chinese hackers are a literal plauge in this game Every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Game ling1111111 zhaolong3453453 sdfrgsde4t32 3423452345 Im LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sure these kind of names are legitamite blue hole you better hire scooby doo to figure this one out EVERY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME
this game is so addictive because you find yourself trying to survive think and kill at the same time It is battle of the brains and skills
Ruined thanks to bluehole studio not fixing the bugs hackers every game and not region locking servers Also they released the game as  10   just so it could be released it on xbox and they have the audacity to call us racist beacuse we don t want the chinese hackers in our games Don t waste 40 on this game it s literally unplayable
I will give Net Neutrality a chance if they region lock China If not I will have to tell our companies to charge Mr Greene for hosting such players out side of the country of origin
A very laggy and unresponsive title should not be at 10
pubg is lyf
SIIIIICK af Add me Koco141 and come play
             
meh solo boring
fede
Quite a fun game

Fun to play winning gives you a thrill most games just cant super smooth shooting after 10There are hackers every now and then and matchmaking with randos aint the way to climb but overall a really fun game well worth 30
PLAYERUNKNOWN s BATTLEGROUNDS PLAYERUNKNOWN s BATTLEGROUNDS  PLAYERUNKNOWN s BATTLEGROUNDS Don t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing get me started on this game this gaming can only be described as a lovehate relationship anybody else that disagrees has either played enough or just is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing angel that doesn t get enraged from the glitches to the gun play PLAYERUNKOWN s BATTLEGROUNDS is a Battle Royale that takes place between 2 different maps Miramar and Erangel The start of the game  with 100 players is revolved around a plane which goes over the entire map which then you can drop out of and land wherever you choose a improved feature which many known battle royales lack Once you get on the ground you need to find loot as you do not spawn with weapons The objective is to win the game by killing anyone who is not a friendly but as the game progresses within the first minute a safe zone will spawn You have a certain amount of time to move to the safe zone before a blue force field encloses onto the safe zone As the game progresses the blue force field does more damage each time a new safe zone is made The feature is supposed to keep players from camping the entire time and push them to a zone where they are forced to fight The game has a lot of potential to be a great battle royale but as of right now it s just not good enough to be great Let me start out with some pros and consPROS______ Good Optimization  Came a good way from being terrible Some good mechanics like Vaulting Creates a SENSE of realism to a certain extent Good ANTI CHEAT systemThat s pretty much it for Pros for me now let s get into the consCONS______ Game lag  even though you can t do much to help this   When the players drop to the ground a solid amount of in game lag when players drop in the beginning of the game which can vastly effect gun play EX  if it s lagging a player can pick up an gun where in the middle of the lag spike you will not be able to pick it up but by the time the lag spike is over the player will already shooting at you FAMOUS hit detection or bullet sponges most of the times you can shoot someone 6 times but they ll take it like it s nothing but they ll grab the same weapon and it will kill you twice as quicker with the same level gear if you used the S1897  Trench Shotgun you know how this feels RNG looting   you can t argue this don t even try it s absurd how you can walk in the biggest house in the area loot all of it but not find a weapon or a good weapon but the person right next to you finds a SCAR L and is gunning you down BUGSGLITCHES let me name of a number of them  DIED FROM FALLING while you re on the ground or taking double damage when falling YOU DIED FROM AN EXPLOSION 50 ft away Parachuting but getting stuck so you fall down and take a huge amount of damage Red zone   RNG death while you re in it The Safe Zone PlacementBlue Forcefield Placement can completely alter the game in your favor or otherwise not in yours Shotguns are not consistent  refer back to Hit Detection or damage LOOT CRATES   Constant duplicates of clothing but not only that the points required to buy the crate goes up each time you buy one they only implement clothing to get you excited but only leave you in disappointment STREAM SNIPING bans or other bans without evidenceBy far the one of the biggest issues in PUBG is hit detection in my opinionThe game has a lot of potential but as of right now as I see no changes being made to fix it If you re going to reply back reply back with facts rather than opinions because all of this exists in the game currently But why do I keep playing  Winning or having fun with friends is the only reason I keep playing which excites you which you try to doALSO INSTEAD OF FIXING THE GAME THEY PREPARE FOR A CONSOLE PORT AND RELEASE I RATE THIS GAME 210
THE DEVS OF THIS GAME INTENTIONALLY ENCOURAGE CHEATING SO THEY CAN MAKE EXTRA MONEY OFF CHINESE GOLD FARMERSGold Farming is a multi billion dollar a year industry in China with prisoners being forced to play games like WoW CSGO and now PUBG to get currency or items that can then be sold for real moneyIn PUBG these Gold Farmers use cheats to win as many matches and get as many crates as fast as they possibly can to get as many items they can sell as they possibly can and with many items selling for hundreds of dollars as well as PUBG being dirt cheap in China this is a profitable venture if done on a large scaleBlueHole gets money every time a cheater makes a new account BlueHole gets money every time a gold farmer sells an item on the marketplaceBlueHole takes weeks to review cheating reports because in those few weeks a gold farmer could easily have made triple the cost of the game in China if not far more depending on the items they got Then after BlueHole has made their money and let the farmers make their money they ban their accoutns so they have to buy a new one and boom BlueHole just made even more moneyBlueHole needs the gold farming business to be profitable because if the farmers make money so does BlueHoleThis is why they take so long to respond to reports This is why there are still so many cheaters This is why they take measures that screw over legit players to make it look like they re doing something while not actually affecting the actual cheatersCheaters  Extra Profit for BlueHole
Paid crates random crashes and countless hackers
Please region lock China In combination with PUBG s horrible netcode and Chinese player s pings its unbearable Fix your netcode or region lock China until you do so  message to Bluehole Studios Don t nuy this game until they do either of those things as your experience will be terrible Fortnite is much better and free
Hey guysThis is a prefect game you know  No MODE no BUG no network delayCan I have a refund 
Buy a parachute skin for 5 just like any other free to playoh wait this isnt free to play
Game is amazing but bunch of hackers REGIONLOCK CHINA
It s so fun but for some reason there s players from China playing on the NA server and I can t understand them in squad mode They also bring a lot of lag with them
The cheating and lack of english speakers on the NA servers makes this not much fun to play
Pros  Killing people is funCons  Getting killed sucks so much
Chinese have taken over North American servers to exploit the lag and cheat Everyone is speaking Asian Every other game I ve been killed by obvious cheaters which by the way it has been confirmed that 99  of them are from China and thats no exaggeration Once I was wrecked by a guy with a shotgun accross an entire city and through several buildings People are spamming steam with dumb accounts with names that are just a bunch of random numbers and letters and Chinese players make up about 60  of steam users from this game alone But no according to the guy who made this game im a xenophobe But hes probably just saying that because hes making serious bank right now Please support region locking and otherwise fun game
bad server
It used to be a really fun game and i enjoyed playing it as well as being really good at it However I had a little break from it for school reasons and once I played it again and came back to it it has never been the same due to me being in every game and killed by a camper I ve had I d say 50 games in the past week and at least 75  of those I was killed by a camper  probably a 12 year old camping with a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing M416 Therefore I give this game a 410 because of its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and annoying campers If people weren t LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s and actually played the game tidy I would give it a 910 which is what i would have gave it before my small break of the game
20
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing interesting
I really enjoy playing this game Every time you jump out the experience is different
    uu
This game is lit  
With the addition of the 3rd map on the Test Server the framerate has dropped to levels not seen since EA Maybe it s the additional traffic  It s really hard to understand how this company can think it s okay to give us such a lousy experience They ve had plenty of time to fix their issuesIt s really hard to win engagements when the game runs at   30 FPS
PUBG mobile is a better game  Play the emulator on PC  You ll thank me later
You will learn the chinese language faster then the game itself
good and bad because there have many hacker
RegionlockChina PLZ Too many cheater came from china I am losing fun in this game
I came back to this game after a long period of not playing I was really suprised by how much the game has improved in performance and how smooth it feels now However as you can tell from the rest of the reviews this game has fell to hackers A shame as it is an amazing game but i cannot recommend it at the moment
It was midday 12 30 Mabe 1 00 The sun shone bright and hot on the small island where we were all waiting There must of been about a hundred of us I looked around me and saw the rest of the combatants I d be squaring off against A man in blue jeans and a black t shirt to show off his muscles in an attempt to intimidate his opponents Next to him was a woman in a long black coat and dark sunglasses avoiding everyone s gaze clearly a loner who got things done her own way A man running around in his underwear and a helmet jumping up and down and punching people in the head Several people tried jumping off a crashed plane possibly in an attempt to take their own life so as to avoid the coming bloodshed but no matter how far they fell no matter how many times they were shot by crazed hooligans in the crowd they seemed to take no damage at allWe loaded up into the cargo plane It was time An abandoned zone of the country had been quarantined off so no innocent civilians would be caught up in the mayhem As we closed in on the coast I checked my map to find a good spot to jump There were several good drop zones each with their merits and disadvantages Some locations had a good amount of buildings to be looted but the more buildings an area had the more likely other combatants would choose that spot to land and I could be caught off guard before I was able to find a weapon More remote rural locations would have less competition but less gear to choose from I decided to take my chances on a remote mansion in the east as I figured few others would drop in the same spot The back ramp of the plane lowered and I walked to the openeing and waited for my turn to jumpAs I stood waiting several other participants ran past me and jumped free falling towards the battlegrounds Dozens of people had chosen the air base as their starting point sacrificing the safety of  the zone  for greater fire power earlier on Don t ask me what the zone is I haven t a clue None of us know  They  won t tell us Just know that if you see that blue wall heading for you you better run like hellWe were getting close now Half a click to my drop point I was doing my final check of my parachute when I realized I had forgotten to wear a shirt Or shoes or pants I was standing in nothing but my parachute my underwear and my holster Come to think of it a lot of us had forgotten the basic essentials of an outfit  Oh well I was sure I could find some clothes in the mansion I looked straight ahead out the back of the plane and gazed at the mountains The sun The ocean in the distance Had I known this was the last time I d be seeing the shimmer of sunlight on the ocean surface I would have taken an extra second to take it all in But there was no time This was my stopThe air hit me cold and hard The sound of the plane s engines were immediately engulfed by the roaring deafening howl of the wind My cheeks were flapping my hair dancing all over the place as I approached the ground at 122 mph At first the terrain was all green No landmarks were noticeable Then concrete objects began to appear as I got closer My eyes must have been playing tricks on me for I would swear that when I got close enough to the ground all the textures of the Earth and the buildings dotting the landscape just  popped  in all at once It was jarring At this moment I panicked not realizing how close I actually was to the ground I clumsily felt for my parachute cord and managed to pull it in time A sudden calm washed over me as I immediately slowed down I caught my breath and took a moment to collect my thoughts again Focus on the mission  surviveAs I descended I looked around to see if anyone else had dropped near me I saw dozens of parachutes filling the landscape in the distance dropping like slowly deflating balloons I landed on the roof of the abandoned three story home On impact I felt all the air in my lungs rush out at once leaving me breathless and winded I saw stars I took a moment to catch my breath but I knew I couldn t take too long I needed a weapon And armor And pants  But first things first  I needed a way off the roof As I stood I surveyed my surroundings There was a shed a small guest home a large garage and of course the three story mansion on which I stood I walked along the edge of the roof looking for a way to climb down As it happened there was a balcony on the second floor going along the wall of the house Careful of my footing I eased myself down and looked around Along the balcony were three doors each leading to a seperate room on the second floor of the house I opened the first door in front of me and made sure to close it behind me I looked around the room and found nothing Just garbage left behind in a hurry I went into the hallway The main area was empty except for a can of energy drink and an old bottle of painkillers Both were no doubt expired but I figured they would be of some help in a tight spot I walked into the second room and found an old backpack The front pouch was ripped off making it useless but the main pouch was still in good shape Underneath the backpack was a black t shirt I slipped it on and went to the next room I opened the door and did a quick look around It seemed to be empty just like the first An empty dresser A broken bed Anything of use was long gone I turned to walk out and move on when I noticed a metal object under the bed It was a pistol A 9mm pistol Just sitting there I picked it up and checked the clip   empty Then the chamber   empty I was disappointed to say the least What good would an empty gun do me  I suppose if I got the jump on someone I could try hitting them with it But then I noticed the box of ammo As I bent down to pick it up I noticed the box had been opened As I took it in my hand I read the label  16 9mm rounds But there were only 15 It was only then that I noticed the single empty chamber on the ground next to the bed and the blood splatter on the wall next to it Either someone was executed or  The gun suddenly felt very heavy in my hands I felt my arm lowering itself involuntarily trying to drop the gun I fought back and remembered my mission once more  surviveI searched the rest of the house and the other buildings on the property and found a few useful things  a medkit two packs of bandages a pair of camo pants and work boots and the motherload  a functioning M16 I put my supplies into my new backpack took a few minutes to load my new weapons then I cheked my GPS The wall was closing in  The zone  was getting smaller and anyone caught outside wouldn t last long Luckily for me I didn t land too far outside the perimeter The new  zone  was only a few hundred meters to the west I grabbed my gear and set offEventually I found what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse I went prone and slowly crawled my way through the grass I was terrified Had someone been here already  Were they gone  Were they still here  I stopped for a moment unable to move I knew I had to go forward as the blue wall was fast approaching behind me but not knowing what was inside this building stopped me cold in my tracks Finally I managed to get up and make my way to the entrance Slowly cautiously I opened the door and looked inside I stood there for minutes just watching and listening I heard a plane overhead Worn down car engines puttering far far away all  accompanied by the random scatter of gun fire I gathered what little remained of my courage and headed insideThen a dude came up behind me downed me with a shotty or some  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   and hit me in the head with a frying pan and I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing died before I got a kill       _ _1010 would play again
Why spend  to travel to China when I can spend 30 
Game is going to die in the LOVE LOVE LOVE  if they don t address the rampant cheating It is a freakin joke Makes myself and a tonne of other player want to abandon this game
Stop playing this game
Cheaters are ruining this game Keeping a tally of OBVIOUS hackers and I am at 78  of games ending due to being killed by a cheater Something needs to be done or players are going to start looking elsewhere
Region lock the chinese they are taking advantage of their bad ping and infesting the NA and Oceania servers with cheaters
PUBG ONE LOVE FOREVER
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BROKEN PIECE OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME MECHANICS FLAWED FILLED WITH ASIANS COMPLETELY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ED
Laggy buggy unoptimized mess
Banned becuse I family shared with my brother nice
Terrible lag and to many hackers
Pile of trash  Do not buy
Could improve fps and add new weaponsvehicles etcor could just release parachute skins that works too
Don t get me wrong its fun with friends also drinks But at its current state it feels almost unplayable at some times Too many hackers glitches and major annoyances Also Bluehole is not listening to any of its fans Even going as far as PLAYERUNKOWN the creator of the game calling the fans who wanted region lock xenophobic because of all the Chinese hackers which is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard Its not xenophobic hacking is at an all time high in places like China Also you cannot communicate with these people there is connection issues making the game unfair and more Sorry with my little rant but I am very frustrated with the current state of the game If their is anything I want people to take away from this its that Bluehole does not listen to their fans
IT MAKES ME HORNY
                                          We need to build a a walla yuge wall
Region lock is desperately needed chinese players invade NA Servers en masse and pollute the player pool with loud chinese speaking players who cant speak english have high pings  200 and make the gameplay experience trash Not to mention that 90  of hackers are chinese I can t even count the amount of times i ve been insta dropped by a hacker from absurd range with impossible accuracy or even shot thru walls
                                                                                                                                    
um  when i uninstalled  this game before why wont it let play it again when i tried to install it one more time 
Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pussies i just got killed by a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing shotgun half way across your shity LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in dirt LOVE LOVE LOVE  map This game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in sucks to many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s and hackers
Game used to be a very fun experience to have with friends until every game was riddled with Chinese laggers and hackers The last straw was having my whole team picked off by someone with a shotgun in a boat miles away I ll definitely play again once all the Chinese and hackers are taken care of
Bought the game and played for a week and now i get a error everytime i  try to matchmake i get a error everytime i access the crate menu and wardrobe menu  ive been having this problem for over a week and a half now and ive sent in several support tickets to pubg trying to get it fixed and they wont do anything about it   i spent 30 for the menu screen the video game 1010
This is a very fun game much better than H1Z1
I have 550 hours on PUBG and I love it and hate it The visual lag is much better but I can t help but feel this is a cover up The game lags as much as ever but you don t see it anymore until you watch playbacks and see how you didn t move or shoot from the other players perspective while on yours you unloaded a full mag into them   I m not on a slow band wisth eitherI really wish that this game gets some serious playability issues sorted instead of introducing the micro transactions that have now appeared
Used to be an amazing game to play with friends Now Chinese hackers have ruined the game almost every game now we get killed from across the map If this isnt fixed soon it will ruin this game as of now its unplayable just not fun
it s lots of fun get it
eight out of ten time you will find that everytime you would get kill by hacker shoot through terrain see through wall and know where you are even you hide in the place where no one would ever ever ever be able to know after that the 2 games you will die out side playzone or ordinary random guys  wo hack kill you 210    should improve the anti cheat
Good game RNG gods be praised
A really good game I bought it two days ago and really liked it
It should be advertised as  Over 20 Million Players Hacking 
I really liked the game But now they introduced new loot boxes which you can get for ingame Points  BP but you have to buy a key for 25 for every boxNow the game I payed full price for feels like a rip off

I see a lot of people disliking the game because of chinese but thats not what I am here for People are complaining to region lock china THIS IS NOT THE PROBLEM The real problem is the game is super LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing broken Bullet registration is half LOVE LOVE LOVE  and only 3 pellets from a shotgun do dmg  Yeah ok Lets not get started on all the bugs Oh you see that bike over there  I bet it would be a fast get away oh wait the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bike flips LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on flat surfaces and kills you for being broken Oh what about the clunky weapon play in CQC  Yeah that could be really fixed to with all the  they have made from milking their customers Legit not worth the money I want to compair it to skyrim on legendary mode you sit there hitting a enemy for a long time with their health being widdled down slowly just so they can go behinde cover to heal up again so it can be another 10min fire fightOh wait what about all the  we made from Pubg  Oh well we ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING MOVIE AND SINGLE PLAYER  CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF IMPROVING THE GAME OH ITS NOT IN BETA ANYMORE BUT YET IT PLAY LIKES PRE ALPHADo not waste your  on this game

This game is a cool game and really addicting
This game is full with hackers and all of them are Chinese even that I m a Chinese all I want to tell Buleasswhole is to REGIONLOCKCHINA it s the only way to save this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
trash game for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  loosers
Is fun has made a ton of progress since alpha
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ridiculous The game is so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing poorly optimized that it isnt even LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing funny The initial lag of the game is still evident when they said they fixed it Even if you have a decent setup you will still lag and have fps drops This game is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing joke and shouldnt even be advertise as a full game I ve spent so many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hours just playing this and i just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing decided that im LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing done with this game untill this game is finally LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing optimized and an actual functioning game these devs should be disappointed on what they put out its a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing joke Dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing buy this game untill you see an update where this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fully optimized
I never ever write reviews for games In fact this is the first review I have posted on steam I m writting this at 1 15 am for some reason but whatever I just want to give my opinion on the game as of 1 13 2018 I was very suprised to see that this game has such mixed reviews Anyway enough about me  let s get on with the review Pros   Stuff I like about itFun to play with friendsGreat for strategy lovers  Feels like you are really in the hunger gamesGetting a kill is very exitingGreat graphicsVery realistic gameplayLoading time between each game is very shortVeriety of ways to playIf you die in this game it s like  eh no biggy on to the next game   Doesn t make me mad easilyThere are a few more I can t think of right now Something to understand Alot of waiting  Depends on playstyle If you are not a god at fps games you will probably end up waiting alot and hiding Most people want to go to areas with lots of people and just play like it s Call of Duty Deathmatch or something Unless you are like in the top 1  of ffps players you will die going into big cities and trying to kill everyone I bought this game expected more shooting and killing but going guns blazing into a crowded city is not how you win this game That s not a bad thing as it turns out I have had loads of fun playing this game but in a strategic sense I found that most of the fun I would get out of the game came once you get to be one of the last 10 15 people alive That s when it gets really intense My heart starts pounding and my hands start shaking But up until that point you mostly are going to be just going through houses and looting for better gear TLDR  Beginning of game is a little boring middle of the game is okgood 30 20 people left end of the game  10 people left is amazing and where pubg shinesCons  Stuff I don t likeRng can screw you over Where the circles are is RNG What weapons you find is RNG The vehicle spawns are random  mostly Sometimes you will just get screwed by RNG and can t do anything about it  Vehicle phisics are still kinda broken  Look up pubg fails on youtube half of the  fails  will be vehicle glitchesPlayers can be toxic  squadsSome game mechanics are not explained when you first start playing eg pressing b will change firing modes ctrl 1234 changes vehicle seats right clicking invintory will make it change slots instantlyIt s getting late so I m going to wrap this up Overall I have really enjoyed this game I would recommend it to people who enjoy strategy and tactical thinking It s a great game to play with friends and have a good time If you like realism in games this game is for you The amount of control you have over your character is amazing If you like the hunger games or ever wanted to feel like you were in it definetly check this game out I think that for its price  about half of AAA games like Call of Duty this game is worth if you like strategy and some fps mixed in I would give this game a 810 Would buy again Anyway sorry for any mistakes in this review I have no prior experience writing reviews so this one might be a little uh  meh  Hope this helped and if you ever want someone to play with hit me up  D Ok good night and good luck in Player Unkown s Battlegrounds

Decent game with a lot of potential but sadly i have uninstalled because of cheaters Literally every other match you will encounter people playing with aimbots totally takes the fun out of the game I would not recommend this game to a friend unless there are patches put in place that can identify and ban aimbots and the like
this is a fun game but in my opinion the people got extremely greedy with crates you use to be able to get a crate for coins some you still can however with this new update they have put in a new crate which has a lock on it and the crate can only be opened but purchasing a key which cost 250  so now im stuck with these crates i cannot open that i did not want in which i have to spend more money to get and all the coins ive worked hard to get are wasted on crates i cannot open thanks pubg for being just like EA
Overall a great game but it s such a shame it s ruined by hackers and tons of screaming chinese people
The game is filled with HackersCheaters who need to have their IP banned  It s literally unplayable because of these morons who cheat Get your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together PUBG Corp
Region lock Please The amount of chinese hackers is outrageous Seems like every game that I do well I get insta headshot by a crossbow across the map
Lack of dedicated servers ruins an otherwise very fun concept
  VAC 
I truly don t understand people who don t like this game because the gameplay is so addictive and refreshing plus all you need 3 friends and you ll have a great time
After around 160 hours played getting killed by cheaterhackers 12 of the time and the other half getting killed before the loading screen finish uninstalled never gonna touch this piece of garbage again
Game is much more optimized than it used to be and much more playable However I can t suggest you buy this game if you are interested in communicating in squads because I ve only met two North American users after 20 hours of gameplay People aren t kidding or exaggerating There are way too many china users playing on NA servers
Great game was a little skeptical because of H1Z1 Also when you win it feels sooooo good cause its a lot harder to win on this game than fortnite
this isnt player unknowns battleground this is welcome to china where only one out of every dozen games do you actually find a team that isnt chinese and QUEING FROM CHINA SINCE BLUEHOLE ISNT STOPPING THEM AFTER CLOSING THEIR SERVERS region block china it is breaking the entire game do not put money into this game until it is fixed litterally joinging dozens of gams in a row and immediatly leaving becase entire squad is chinese every time and speaks no english and then listening to all chat in most games all you hear is chinese this was banned in china so their people coulnt play it not so they can come over to our servers instead either leave their crap up and deal with it or ACTUALLY BAN THEM LIKE YOU ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DO
The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is Micro Transactions doing in this game i don t want to buy a key after buying a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing crate with the ingame currency get bent
This game man Challenges your inner hate with crashes even after the v1 update 13 games and totally bugs sometimes without a single reason no matter the system you have And if thats not enough you have to deal with a bunch of chineseBut I guess its fun to play  when you actually can with friends  which are not included with the game of courseEdit  Game freezes even more now for no reason Plz suck my balls devs Thanks
so much lagg   64 tick bullets not register you see blood but never register you shot  high end pc s 100 fps max   tons of bugs wth parachute and vehicle s not worth at all this 30 euro
This has got that good ebolaI have found the commanderI have found our queenbut more importantly this is da wae
game would be good if I actually got put in with people who speak the same language as me but instead every game is 90  asian Also the sound effects in the game is bad as soon as the plane comes  even if its not that close and youre inside thats all you can hear Wouldn t recommend if you re short tempered either
1 suggestion that would improve this game expereince Inlcuding a chat function for your party members would be good
Honestly i d love this game a LOT if the netcode and hit reg was consistent oh and also REIGON LOCKING CHINA
Gameplay is fun and interesting but only 2 maps at the moment so gets old after a bit So many cheaters on it at the moment and the developer only seems interested in introducing a lootbox system a system nobody gives a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about because only an idiot would pay more money for a game once they had already bought the game unless it gives quality content for a reasonable price not 2 for a key that might give you a special sock if you re lucky
AWESOME BUY IT NOW
Very nice game after the patch almost all the bugs were fixed a game with good graphics good gameplay and lots of hours of enjoyable gameplay 
Amazing Game just the recoil control and identifying were enemies are isn t accurate
ching chang chong 10010
Este juego es increble para el nuevo jugador porque nunca se sabe lo que encontrar cada vez que aterrice en uno de los 2 mapas bellamente diseados Este juego es uno de los juegos con mayor produccin de adrenalina en Internet Hay alguien a la vuelta de la esquina  Alguien va al lanzamiento  De dnde me disparan  Tienen un arma mejor que yo  Solo muchas razones para tener palmas sudorosas Personalmente me encanta este juego y lo juego constantementeTranslation This game is amazing for the new gamer because you never know what you will find whenever you land on one of the 2 beautifully designed maps This game is one of the most heart pumping adrenaline producing games on the whole internet Is there someone around the corner  Is anyone going to the airdrop  Where am I getting shot from  Do they have a better gun than me  Just many reasons to have sweaty palms Personally I love this game and play it constantlyEDIT  Now there is a third map and it is beautiful
This is good boom boom game with shacka shacka kills only no hands guys who doesn t kill dislike this game
Even tho its already 10 its more like beta with a lot of bugs and potato servers roflJust skip this game
Ok This is a great game Seriously So why negative  Because this game is great by two days after everey patch Week after patch there is a lot of cheaters lags If you saw how shroud has played this game stop think that you can be the same You will not maybe when you ll download some no recoil macro aim assist radar always ON  That s players with sensitive helpers which ruin this game If you see guy running on mid of the zone like in Call of Duty don t even try to conquer him On reasume  it s pretty nice game can give a lots of fun but you can get much more frustration from hackers very bad loot poor spawn of car especialy when you need one You want to play  Buy it and wait for patch relase then play lot until you will reach that moment when there is more hack in lobby than normal players Then you take a rest from this game to next patch That s the best way to have fun from this
Early release or no this is one fun gameSeems devs are listening to the playerbase about issues and working to resolve them
Great game but something more effective than game bans must be done against the hackers
loves this game its sooo fuuunnnnn
because you cannot choose what map to play
THIS GAME IS BY FAR THE WORST GAME I HAVE PLAYED IN A WHILE FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGE YOU PATHETIC CODING AND PATHETIC MECHANICS CANT BE MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN THAT
OMG idk what to say the game by itself is great but I am having a big trouble a game killing trouble The game keeps saying  lost connection to host 364  in every single game I have requested a refund and I hope it is not too late since this game aint cheap I know the problem isnt caused by my computers specs  ryzen 3 1200   1060 3gb or my internet speedOnly buy if u are sure that you are not having any problems like mineBesides the giant issue Im having it is a great game Im still requesting the refund hope it is accepted Im so sad I couldnt play it properly
poidet
i built a computer for this game 1110
very fun game by brendan greene please add gun that shoots lasers but only available in carepackage 910
I was really unsure as to whether to buy this game I read all the reviews mentioning hackers and the ones about streamers banning players etc In the end my friend encouraged me and I bought the game So glad I did In my first 2 weeks i somehow fit 40 hours of gametime in which is unheard of for me as I don t game much these days In that time i ve not come across any hackers haven t got on the wrong side of any streamers and as such i ve really enjoyed this game If you re on the fence give it a go There is enough people playing now that the chances of coming across a hacker is slim to none and even if you do theres a good chance someone else will blow your head off with a Kar98k anywayBuy this
grros
I didn t cheat on my game You were too inhumane I played for 160 hours or a new one I see people cheating in Internet cafes are not sealed you are really speechless
Best enjoyed with friends Despite its flaws  Yes even in full release it still has bugs its a amazing fun time with no wrong way to play
Incredibly fun a little unstable at times
Great idea WORST implentation EVER This piece of junk can t compare to even one of the ever created shooter games Its main idea   to survive AND SHOOT is worthless game crashes so often even though MY PC setup is great it lags desync kills you behind walls very often and server frequency rates drop below 10 Hz which is totally awful Looting is just ridiculous you press F like 4 times to pick up a single item from the ground Can t even number all the stupid things  I guess Koreans can t make a game like others companies in the West do even the movements are disgusting Hitboxes Its so random
60fps no problem but make sure you dont get shot at or have to shoot because then it drops to 0fps
Dis game show me da wae
Better hope your computer can keep up because that s the only thing that will get you a win If you get any kind of frame drops this game will screw you over
Used to be awesome in early release Game quality went downhill with time Every single NA server game is flooded with asian people Dont get me wrong they are nice but i simply cannot communicate with them Many team kill non chinese players And the hacks are over abundant The game is no longer enjoyable and Brendan Greene can suck a fat one letting it die
rip pubg
Needs region lock
PUBG is fun but needs region lock The amount of Chinese players in the NA server is ruining the game in my opinion they team kill the non chinese players and team comp is nearly impossible People will get tired of it eventually
When i first started playing PUBG it was full of glitches and bugs many have been fixed some are still there but the Dev intead of fixing everything to make the game much more smooth and less power hungry they choose to add new content and mask the things the make the game almost unplayable for many people the game is horribly optimizedIt was getting better i was giving it time since it was a Beta but now comes out version 10 and Same LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  still there PLUS now the game and all servers are plagged with chinese hackers theres not a game that i dont encounter one or 5 10 20 It got the a point where i see no pleasure of gaming anymore you spend your free time playing a game that gets ruinned by a freaking chinese hacker And what are the Devs doing about it  NOTHING because the amount of money the chinese gamers bring is way more than the rest of us so in a way is good for them to have the hackers they ban them they buy a new game hack again gets banned and the cycle continuesSo for now i don t recomend the game its a lot of fun but for now it will just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you off
A new survival adventure awaits you every time It s an adrenaline rush
Game concept is great however it feels that its not implemented quite as good as it could be Mainly the fact that youre forced to be constantly on the run most of the times youre probably running with little to no ability to defend yourself leaving much of the game play to pure roll of the dice and not so much skill The uneven distribution of quality guns is terribleLastly time to speak about the players which are 99  Asian  the ethnicity not really being a problem except for the inability to communicate Being part of a squad or team is of paramount importance to succeeding in this game if you cannot communicate with your team youre basically playing solo This significantly reduces your chances to ever win the game I give this game a thumbs down 100  because of this factor It is by far the most significant in my view as it hinders the game play
If you have friends to play this with definitely get it although you can play it by yourself and still have fun playing it with friends is just such much more exciting
I hope i will have a coat 
Saw a nice shack went into it got blasted with a shotgun Fun game 1110 would play again
This game is super buggy and the developers only care anout money  like I say Blue Balls You suck
I regret everything aabout buying this game at the start it was fine because it was small and new The concept was so cool at first that we put aside the awful fps lag with loot and awful hit reg becasue it was still better than H1Z1  since you didn t blow up randonly while driving Now almost a year later and several hundred hours and my friend group thousands of hours toegther I can say it has not changed They saw the money and ran with iut LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  making the game better lets keep adding new shiny stuff to lure new players and spread it to consels I knew what path the game was taking when the loot crates came out then with keys then seperate keys for sepperate crates We wait months and find out they were working on mobile and weapons skins locked under loot crate and key LOLYou can see it on twitch the streamers constalty berrate the game and want to quit and some do Save yourself the time and find another battle royal that will actually want to improve the game not just suck more people into it
sucks LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
great game runs supper well not a game id play alone tho but other then that fun game really good id give it 710 for rate
This is the dumbest game ever There are over 3million idiots just like me that bought this So dumb that I still play it and i hate it so much WHY do I play this game
Terrible game Laggy full of cheaters poor hit reg Don t waste your 
Every update  more game breaking mechanics  They have no plans to stop people from constantly hacking because they know it just generates more money for them because the banned accounts just buy new copies  They  fix  the rain map and fog map  aka just remove them from the game because enough people cried about it but stay silent when the overwheling demand to region lock China is being yelled at the top of our lungs  The new map is atrociously large making it so you can get to the last circle with never seeing another player at all  This isnt a finished game  Used to be a 1010  Now its a hard 310
The only problem I found with this game is it will consume all of you time I love the game my wife hates it because it is sucking the soul from my body
Fun game if they do something about all the hackers I took a guys jeep and drove off he started shooting at me then he suddenly stops then i get kicked into the passenger seat and he starts shooting again I switch back to driver seat and the gas doesnt work So i jumped out to avoid him getting a free kill Whats the point in playing if you have to cheat  Is it even fun  How do you get any better at the game  What enjoyment is there to be had Maybe I ll just go back to playing it on Xbox And what is the point in regional servers if people aren t going to play in their region  New PC player and this crap is really turning me off
Phenominal game I found an Ak before meds Felt like a kid from Africa
This is a pretty awsome game
This game is trash
I get killed by hackers every time I play Please follow up on your statement to ban China because over 95  of the hackers are in China This link is a vieo of me getting killed by a hacker https wwwyoutubecomwatch vbK6D5qDxEpI featureyoutube
Good game but still lacking something idk maybe like a rank system so people have something to grind towards other than loot boxes
It is fun
server sucks like a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
servers LUL
I love this game no more hackers Although I found out if you get a special box you have to pay to open i dont want to feel like i have to pay for anything in fact this game should of been free to begin with also they need to make an update to add more weapons
Way too many hackers With kill cams it is even easier to see the aim botting idiots or other suspect behaviour And now it seems that loot boxes are getting even worse with paid keys to unlock new crates Maybe the game will get better I m not sure But for now I wouldn t suggest getting it
Optimization feels almost as bad as ea loot boxes in frame rate form and as the other  20000 negative reviews have already stated the chinese hackers are everywhere and need to be dealt with instead of the community just being called racists for speaking out about it
Broken LOVE LOVE LOVE  game with nothing but chinese players who don t understand english they always play on USA servers LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing up this game Laggy LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers and lots of speed hackers Could be fun but really laggy and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Just uninstalled PUBG Fun game but you just had to add microtransactions keys to unlock crates on a game I had to purchase to play Goodbye PS to any developers future games with paid loot crates are NOT going to go well with your customers
This game will die
And here comes the Money GrabSo the new patch comes with a bunch of BP and you ll probably get the new crates with it However you now need Keys to open crates with no way to get them in game That with unaddressed bugs that have been consistant since before the official release still plague the game But they will make patches to increase their profits before fixing the numorus bugs I think I would recommend Fortnite before PUBG just for this If you are paying for a game no matter how much The game mechanics need to be addressed before profit generating money grabs And without region locks Chinese hackers are ruining the game while Bluehole just worries about the money they collect I dont expect the player population to grow much more and will probably start to bomb if these issues arent addressed before they keep trying to take money
Was great until they added the new boxes Not gonna spend 250 on a key to open a loot crate
I played a game of squad got matched with 2 random chinese guys Throughout the match i noticed they were pretty good But then i realized that they were hacking and getting kar98 headshots on everyone By the time i realized i was playing with chinese hackers it was the final 10 and i sprayed them both down with my AkChinese screams ensued 1010 would teamkill chinese hackers again
pretty good besides the screaming racism in every lobby
Great Game So fun to play
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game is not a finished product
yo wtf i cant even play the game due to servers being busy for like the past dayplz fixthis happens after almost every update i like the game but it wont make any difference if u cant play it would it 
Except from on weekends very nice game on weekends uplayable improve LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers

nice new patch bluehloe
   madepubggreatagain
Honsetly i dont think there is nothing left to say to this game all i want to say is this game haves terrible netcode and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  tone of problems that needs fixing But do you know what bluehole does over that problem  They add new crates that you can only open with buying a key with real money Theese peaple really dont know how to deal with problems over a video game I just want to unlock my steam badge so pls dont bully me
I love to die
Playerunknown s Battlegrounds has to be one of my all time favourite games This is due to the fact that every game is unique and the combat system is almost flawless in my opinionThe Maps The 1st map Erangal is full of unique areas ranging from busy action packed citys to massive open fields allowing players to never feel as if they are always fighting the same fight The 2nd and most recent map to be released is Miramar This map is a more open desert map featuring less cities and more open areas allowing snipers to have a major advantageHow is the game played The game starts when 100 players  by them selves or in groups ranging from 2 to 4 players are dropped onto 1 of the 2 maps Players can decide where to drop on the map this allows players to control the route which they take in this action packed first person shooter Once the players land they have to scower the land for a range of supplies including guns medical supplies and armour Once players have all the loot they can possibly find the game forces players to fight by restricting the play zone If players are in the zone it damages them enough to put them at a disadvantage This shrinking zone forces possibly unwanted combat upon the players The players must use a wide range of weaponary to make sure that their team is the last team standingThe Combat Playerunknown s Battlegrounds combat is quite basic compared to most first person shooters The game features guns melee weapons and grenades Pubg is quite realistic as far the combat goes Bullets in this game feautre bullet drop off meaning players have to predict where their enemy is going to go in order to secure a killBeing in Top 10 Some people would say the game begins once there is only ten people left This is because the atmosphere is way more intense Players can be metres away from eachother without even knowning it This makes the player feel a sudden sense of adrenaline as deathvictory could be moments away The playzone is so small that players have no room for mistakes In a way the final few zones shows who is really good at this game It also shows that players can collapse under pressureProblems With Pubg Although pubg is one of my favourite games of all time it isn t perfect Players will often experience certain bugs such as buildings not loading in and the motorcycle blowing up when being tickled by the ground Another issue is the amount of hackers Pubg features many hackers  mostly Chinese These people will ruin the gaming experience of any player The final issue is the overall lag When you drop out of the plane there is consistent rubberbanding and teleporting through buildingsOverall thoughts Although Pubg has some bugs and glitches I would heavily reccomend this game due to how unique every game is I have been addicted since my 1st game I rate pubg a 8510
Can t recommended until Brendan Greene sorts his LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out
I have laptop with 7700 16ram gtx1070 ssd20 60 fps on very low is ridiculous
really good game challenging worth it 100 
Too many hackers wont region lock the chinese hackers and people who use ping advantages would be much better without chinese hackers
Game was fun now hackers and esp aimbotters are running rampant game had a good structure upon release the game became a filth pool of scummy hacker Would not recommend till region locks Change from client side to server side ffs
Servers don t work at all and now they realising a trade lock What can be worst 
End my suffering
Good game bad support Devs don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about cheaters Will allow cause 
THIS SUCKS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS BUGGY LOVE LOVE LOVE  F KING LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME
Game needs to make players play on their own country servers To many asian players which makes it impossible to communicate
Fortnite is better Belive me you will have more fun there
 bug
Do not buy this game if you have AMD GPU Literally unplayable
Great game Never gets old new ways of playing ever match with the circle never being the same Has some bugs but definitely not enough to make the game bad in any way  still early access so it s to be expected Strongly recomend it
This is a fun game but there are issues that need to be solved most in particular the De sync and lag
The most fun I ever had with my clothes onEDIT 230118Ok so this game has soooooo much potential  It is genuinely fun to play BUT Server send rates are awfulCheating is a problemHit detection is a lotteryVehicle physics will often just decide to kill youLoot distribution seems a little wonkyLack of training mode  custom server for regular peepsDrops that are pay to open  Last 7 crates were Desparado le sighSadly it is not possible to play this game in a competitive manner in it s current iteration  Dear publisher please allow your devs to fix this game and stop making them work on microtrasactions
you know battleye is a really good anti cheatshame this doesnt have it
I will not recommend this game until the publishers fix the hacker issue It s gotten out of control to be honest completely unacceptable at this point of the game
Game still needs work Ever since the most recent update the close quarter battles have been very bad with the D sync Game is still not optomized and needs alot more work The game has its good moments
While this game is fun and packed with intense firefights various bugs glitches and cheaters prevent it from being an enjoyable experience when playing alone I d only recommend this if you have the right group of friends that understand survival in PUBG
This game has tons of hackers connection issues and the game crashes now and again I will say its a fun game when everything works but how incomplete the game is and how infuriating it is to be haveing a good game and for the game to crash then you get killed wile rebooting to me its just not worth it
i have played this game as much as i can with work and what not and it has been a blast to play but as of late the amount of chinese that has invaded the NA servers is rediculous i dont really care for the cheaters your gona run into them in just about every game that you play people that cant play the game well resort to some kind of cheat to help them be better must be sad to have to resort to that anyway my gripe is not really that they are chinese it is the fact that i have played for the past few days and have not had one random squad that speaks english if i did not want to comunicate with my squad i would play solo or on an asia server but a BIG part of this game in squads is being able to understand and talk to your teamates for vital information like hey you guys are shooting at someone where are they or hey we are hold out in a house everyone take a direction and let everyone else know if you see someone coming another thing is the team killing is getting pretty bad too i will put this game down for now maybe be back later once this issue is solved as of right now DO NOT BUY THIS GAME you will not enjoy it as it once was
This game went from a favorite to one of the worst games in my libraryLook all through EA I defended the game for it s flaws it was still a gorgeous and fun game  But then China  Yes Im sorry but this is what it is  This isn t racism this isn t nationalism this is just the hard facts  According to Brendon  Playerunknown  Green roughly 99  of all cheat programs for this game are coming out of China right now  In addition the lag and ping of China players on NA or EU servers makes it that much harder for a local player to actually hit the high ping from China  Finally some of the most racist things I ve ever heard have come from the chinese players of this gameI simply can not recommend this game at all and would actively advise anyone from buying it until some sort of region locking system is in place and Bluehole starts really cracking down a lot harder on the cheaters in the gameUntil then playing this game legit is basically signing up to be a target dummy for those players with cheats who have a massive advantage over you
As of right now I can t recommend this gameUnless you like being frustrated by a Hackers killing you every few games with aimbotsb An unoptimized and inconsistent game performance  I m running a 970 and 16 gigs of RAMThen stay away from this
This game has really came a long way since release I really enjoy it and i look forward to seeing what happens with it in the future
Worth the money and fun game

opskins rip like ur gamewell done bluehole kys
H1z1 and fortnite is better Pubg is going to trash like SEE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GO  GLOBAL TRASH FIX TRADE OR GOODBYE FOREVER
amazong
As much as I like the game it is absolute cancer with the amount of Chinese players on NASAEU servers abusing the system while the developer continues to allow this due to some nonexistent moral highground The language barrier is a frustration for many english speaking players as well GG if you get teamed up with guys that just yell China Numba 1 hahaha as they TK you and loot your corpse For examples sake if I don t speak Russian why would I choose to play on a Russian server ffs  Few times have I encountered a hacker but the amount of times I have come across a ping abusing Chinese player I ve lost countRegion lock or adding a ping limit would solve this No it is not racist it is a practical solution that many other games employ I realise some are circumnavigating this with VPNs that can be combated as wellAdding keys that costs real money to open a crate a player has already grinded in game currency to purchase is utter LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and yeah yeah I know it doesnt take an extreme amount of time to do this But this isnt a FTP game  add that to the growing cons list However in the end I have high hopes some of these issues will be fixed and will be glad to recommend once said changes take place As recent as yesterday articles have been released mentioning a sort of  soft ping cap  is being looked at Time will tell
good shooter 910
PUBG tem uma idia muito boa uma jogabilidade legal mas  to mal otimizado que parece que foi feita pela industria de placas de vdeo para vender placas mais carasAtualmente  injogvel devido aos erros de servidores
mint
Game so laggy unoptimized and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t
While the game is still buggy as it was in pre release developers are starting to address the issues  albeit slowly It s a game where you can spend 20 minutes gearing up and then die in a fraction of a second At the same time kills are very satisfying and so is the thrill when you are left within the final 10 survivors of the round It sure as hell is not an easy game takes time to grasp the concepts but if playing in a party of friends you will have fun from game 1 That is if you don t get stuck in a mountain
Terrible unoptimised Lots of server side issues that makes the game unenjoyable No matter what you think you see on your screen the desync and the lagg thinks otherwise Also lots of cheaters and bugs It has some potential and might be a cool game just not right now
Great game but got boared after 400 hours
i would start off the review by saying tat PUBG has nice graphics but the FPS falls with them so you will most likely have to play with low graphics  does not effect preformance The game is consept is simple but the game is not it takes time to get better i have been playing the game for about 8hrs and i have ONCE The game has a wide selection of weapons from friying pans to machine guns and sniper rifles In game you will come acros two game modes which are SOLO and TEAM  hopefully you undersatnd what that means Over all the game is fun and copmpetative i rate it 810 HAVE FUN
Play this game with my friends for 2 hours and it feels so guuuddd
That s what you get scrubs
You can only trade with friends terrible decision don t buy this game it s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  go play fortnite
Unreal retarder game for idiots with hacks
This game is garbage I ve played for 80 hours letting the hype of winning distract me from the fact that this game is laggy as hell has op shotguns and grenades and the servers are always down The game s been out for a year and you ve made hella money from it damnit fix this game bluehole
wow this game sucks but unless you get the dessert map then it sucks even more but wait what about angelica you ask well then you should get the game because dp2810 quick maths but wait theres more what about th

Not a good game unless you have friendsGreedy Dev team doesn t help Limits to 6 boxes per week to keep prices of market prices high pay to open loot boxesGreene called people calling for China to be region locked racist xenophobes for wanting china region locked out of NA servers  just for reference china is shown in data to literally be 99  of all hackers While refusing to fix the hit reg issuesDev team is full of greedy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  who seem to not give a damn about the game anymore if you haven t bought it don t
Go play Fortnite instead At least that game doesnt run like garbage
Few weeks ago me and my friends in Russia have connection problem with this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  gameand they don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
pubg corp is full of empty promises keep your 30 bucks and wait for either the full game to come out or play something else Its hard to love this game when they can give a fat S    about wether the customer is pleased or not they have some of the worst net code desync network lag hit detection that I have seen The chinese hackers are not going anywhere my biggest gripe is they promised things to the customer and have yet to implement it for example the shooting range where a player can practice and dial in guns and practice their aim and recoil control nope instead adds emotes stupid gun skins and devote resources to building a new map the core elements gun control desync and bugs galore but alls well that ends well if pubg burns i wont be mad i got my 30 out of it
Used to be fun Now Half my deaths are from hackers and cheaters Ruining the game Pretty easy to tell when they do a 180 and two shot you with an AKM
I love this game so much
game devs wont change major issues and when players complain they are called xenophobic
I have to pay real money to open a crate that I bought with in game currency  No thanks
lethal
aaaaAAAaaAAA NAMBA KOREA NAMBA KOREAAA AAAAQ NAMBA KOREAAA
They can add lootboxes but not fix the mountains in Mirmar or the laggy frame issues I love this game and probably will continue to play it but in this state do not purchase this

my god put region lock you idiot
Bad optimization server lag issues a lot of bugs glitches hackers and chinese kids who are taking over european servers However if you try to ignore all those issues i believe you can have a lot of fun with this game It s the best battle royal game out there and it s really challenging for you and your gpu First time finishing in the TOP 3  is great feeling incomparable to any other gaming experiance
Fix your damn servers Bluehole After a certain amount of time persistent servers issues come down to the developer not investing in their own product Two weeks in a row with NO events after you removed this week s War Mode for a game that has been  out of early access  is unaccaptable and not worth the constant updates
The size of the expectation is the same as the disappointmentNice gameplay bad servers too much hackerscheaters and has a lot of bugsThis game feels like an Alpha game and not like an official one
Everything was fine but then they had to switch to the newest version of their engine which brought forth way to many bugs These bugs seem to have distracted the technical side of the development team Since they added the desert map gameplay has barely improved and all that has been added since 10 has been cosmetics Some in guns form some in vehiculair form but for the most part in skins you get from lootboxes I ll recomend this game when they improve the movemnt system and think of a way to make mid game less boring
Review My only actual feeling when I play this game is disappointmentAt no point in all of my games of running looting maybe shooting did I actually feel satisfied or even enjoymentThe main problem with battle royale games is that 90  of the time it s running through endless places and looting That is the main reason why I feel this game is disappointing Because after running around for 20 30 minutes there will be someone who absolutely destroys you loots you and walks away to complete the cycle once more I don t mind a learning curve but if you want someone to learn don t make it where the mistakes he makes causes his efforts to feel fruitless and leave a sharp rage against unfairnessNow alot of you reading will just scream  GIT GUD  but that isn t an issue The issue is the natural inbalance of loot in this game Of course skill does play a part but in the end of the day there are only three players of this game the experienced the ones with the good loot and the beginners The inbalance of loot is naturally made because nobody ever lands in the same spot Causing some to die prematurely and others to get varying degrees of loot This issue cant simply be addressed by a tweak in the game but you could beat the top player of PUBG if you had a kar98k with an 8x scope on hill with decent aiming and he only had a crowbar Conclusion This game can be  fun  for those who play it regularly but for those who want to try it out I give a very fair warning DO NOT BUY IF YOU DO NOT LIKE VERY UNREWARDING LEARNING CURVES ANDOR YOU DO NOT LIKE RUNNING AROUND FOR 20 MINUTES ONLY TO DIE
i realy likke tis game i plei veri mutch vei guud
verry good
Honestly this game rocks That being said there is a serious issue with hackers The developers are not doing a good job at solving the hackers problem Many have suggested a region lock to block out Chinese players which is one solution that would work Another solution would be to remove the exploits allowed by client side computing Resolve the latency issues and set things up so that particular data is handled server side so that a user would not be so easily capable of exploiting game data All in all the game is solid but not what I would expect from a 10 release It feels rushed for a quick cash grab for the holiday season
Very fun game yes
Thanks for the update
HiAfter 1 year of playing this game I can finally say that I wouldn t buy this game at first place Why you ask me  Well the main reason I just uninstalled this game is the netcode of the servers For me as an online gamer with many years of experience in Counter Strike  or for any others COD Battlefield etc it is very important to have as little delay as possible especially when I tried to play this game  professionally  A gamer that isn t that kind of  tryharding  player as me can t tell you the difference Models you see in game are very precise but when it comes to shooting it feels like the bullets are living in the matrix On your screen you see 5 bullets hit your opponent but didn t die  NO PROBLEM when you watch the deathcam apparently you shot him only twice and he shot only 1 deadly bullet in your ankleThe professional term for the cause of this problem is server s tickrate For the best example just google 64 tick vs 128 tick for CS GO or PUBG vs Fortnite netcode to see what s the difference The Devs are really hard working I understand the problems with FPS when I was playing  professionally  but it seemed like they don t do much about it I have decent PC and I had big problems while fighting with 30 fps  16 teams of 4 players around or even my teammates with better PC s had also struggles In the end I can t recommend this game to be honest I ll probably come back to this game because I like the idea of Battleroyale but since I can t be sure if my shots will hit the opponent I just want to prevent you guys from buying this addicting annoying and broken game
It s alittle difficult to aim for the newbie playersShould add training map for them
so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in good but need fix the one way fence

Full of Chinese hackers and cheaters

Good game but the Chinese ruin the entirety of the experience Please region lock this game
This game is amazing  I ve played it for countless hours I highly recommend it
Great game just needs more optimization
Aside from hacking issues  not as common as you might think I m really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that I sometimes receive loot crates that require a purchased key to unlock
More Hackers than you can imagine LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  mechanics and and the parkour is stupid the fact that there is 2 maps and one is absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yet you get it 90  of the time Their are 20000000000000 Chinese people on the NA server because the de sync gives them benifit of the doubt even though theyre LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at the game Gun play is unbalanced and needs majpr help Stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Game Do Not Buy this if youre not a therapist and are not seeing one currently they dont ban hackers they dont give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  they only care about the streaming community LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this Game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  these LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  devs LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the Piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  they allow to hack on their servers
Since the introduction of 10 a huge number of cheating chinese players ruin the game Wallhackaimbotno recoil hack you name it However Bluehole seems to be intrested only inthe income which he can milk from these  players  In the last two weeks i had to report at least two dozen obvoius cheatersthis is killibg this game I like Pubg a lot but this will be gamebreaker for me if they dobt sort this out soon
         
PUBG is a very bad game yet its the best of its kindPros   The game is noobfriendly and very easy to learn   The rounds are short  the longest possible round would be 30min  15 20 is more likely  There are many players so finding matches is easyCons   The Netcode is plain horrible which grants ppl with high ping an advantage  The gunplay and movement are also kinda wonky due to inputlag when shooting or running 120 250ms   Source  youtubecomcBattleNonSense  Too many Hacker  PUBG banned up to 8000ppl per day yet its not enough   Source  twittercomplayerunknownstatus907913534964506625 lang  No option to choose which map to play  They implemented pay to open lootboxes which they first stated to never be implemented  No 3 man team mode only soloduosquad
Quite dead in Oceania
EU servers are overloaded and many times its not posible to connect
optimize this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing gamebalance this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing gamefix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing gamefix china s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing servers or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing region lock themor give me my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 30 bucks backgo LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yourself playerunknowngo back to modding this game is awful
ReigonLockChina Until they reigon lock the game PUBG will be bad Can t make it into a top ten situation due to cheaters  all of which happen to be chinese killing me in the early game stage The game just isn t fun anymore I don t understand how the developers haven t solved this issue yet it s been a problem long before 10 and continues to be a problem Game has gone down hill a lot since 10 Unfortunate
Overall the game is incredibly fun to play The mechanics are quite simple that anyone can pick it up Whether it s Solo s Duo s or Squad s the game still somehow keeps you  hooked  That s about all the good things I can say about the game Now my problem with the game comes in a couple of ways  one of them being CHEATERS I ve come across several instances where I get randomly killed from a player who is not even near me For example one such experience occurred while playing Squad s with randoms My whole team was in a building taking cover yet somehow everyone got killed through the walls from headshots Since I was confused on how exactly I got murdered through the wall I ended up reviewing the replay Apparently someone from who knows where shot at  random  through MOUNTAINS and through walls killing me and my whole squad This infuriates me to no end With this in mind one thing crucial to keep in mind is that these types of experiences always happen with people who are CHINESE I understand the creator of this game has spoken of such issue but I m sorry the creator isn t doing enough to fix the problem I see many reviews here demanding a region lock for Chinese players and I m sorry but I have to agree with them I know it sounds incredibly harsh but I ve had it Another thing since a massive number of Chinese players are now flooding into the North American server it s almost impossible to find someone who speaks ENGLISH Whenever I click on the NORTH AMERICAN server I expect players speaking ENGLISH Seriously the server is named North American but almost no one speaks English This probably sounds extremely petty but I can t enjoy Duo s or Squad s anymore since I cannot understand a single thing from my teammates Overall I m going to be supporting the REGION LOCK demand like many others I know as I ve said before it s harsh but I can t take it anymore
Boooooo on the last update Let s give you a garbage compensation and with that compensation give you loot crates that you need to buy a key for like just make the game better would be better compensation
The game is fun untill you get killed by a Chinese person hacking or just abusing the lag  At this time thats almost every game the only time it dosnt happen is when someone manages to kill the hackers  I play on the North American server it is rare that I get killed by a non Chinese person  Not racist just want a fair game and good team play
addicting gameUnoptimizedless hackers as of latefor 30 i got more than 200 hoursworth the buy                                    
Great game but huge amount of cheaters and not much being done about it  Released  for Christmas but still has a huge amount  of the same bugs it had before the offical release clear push for money and now they re pushing for money with the crate system Now if you buy a crate using ingame earned currency and are unfortunate enough to get a desperado create you HAVE to buy using real money a key in order to open that crate Ingame currency wasted if you don t want to do that and the crate is just going to sit in your inventory trying to tempt you to spend more money on a game you ve already paid for
I ve been a fan of this game since it first came to Steam and until now I ve ignored the bugs and poor optimization in the hope that it will get better once the game becomes full release and the Devs have the time to fix this stuff It s now May 2018 and the optimization is currently worse than it has ever been A vast majority of the bugs have not been fixed and Bluehole have decided to develop garbage like PUBG Mobile and more loot crate bullsht I used to respect and support the Dev team behind this thoroughly enjoyable FPS Battle Royale game but now I am just dissapointed and upset that greed and selfishness has destroyed this game s potential I ll never be one of those kids that plays ForkKnife or Call of Duty but I m certainly going to stop playing this game until the Dev team actually LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing do something that doesn t benefit their own wallets directly We re dissapointed in you Bluehole This is not the way to go if you want to be remembered
Great game if you like to have mini heart attacks
I have been unable to log in for the past 24h   Servers too busy Also horrible lag and fps dropsThe game design and concept are brilliant but the execution is atrociousHopefully a real developer will make a better battle royal soon
Pretty good game overall with minor cons which are constantly being fixed by the developers This game has made a great title as it shot up in the steam charts and now everyone is playing it I highly recommend this game however the main downside is perfomance due to its advanced newer Unreal Engine Due to this mostly fps sits at around 60 80 and that is a perfect framerate to play at However the community is great fun aswell as amazingly funny Genuinely enjoy this game and hope to see me content come out as the game pursue s its path for victory  Or chicken dinner to the player
Great game play and the game mode of battle royal is a total game changer It s a pity this game has so many bugs and is sometimes unplayable Between random bugs that get you killed or cheaters it s a very frustrating game The overall experience is okay it s not really an enjoyable game It s still a work in progress so keep doing what you are doing Devs  D
The only problem of this game 1 There are several diffirent regionsservers but still the chinese players are everywhereThere s a specific server that says China but still they join into other region like EuropeNA etc PS  this is not racism for bringing      out the problem of this game2 Because of many different people are changing trough servers and regions there are alot of cheating and bugs exploits     that Bluehole can t fix  Why am i recommending this game 1  Fun to communicate with people you ve just met2  Fun to play with your friends3  Many coincident funny moments and alot more Gameplay  810Controls  910Fun  1010RegionLock Bluehole Like to get this recommend some notice    Have a happy day folks                                                                                                    Gardi  germagnolia  Battuvshin
In 20th century the Chinese is your ancestors invasion killing tens of millions of people and now your country crowd out struggle of the Chinese people let them displaced let them economic collapse or even the lyrics also laugh at Chinese although we also hate plugins but with what lock in China we Chinese people have stood up we beat your economy laughing at the white can t afford to buy a house because of the expensive tax we also want to say in addition to China all the blockade you buy a seal a we Chinese only medieval beast culture and a group of slave society in two hundred countries and RACES you either like most Chinese people an apology or we hit you kneel for mercy to the game
The code is straight garbage and I cannot think of anything substantial to back up my recommendation However this game simply scratches an itch that no other game out there does You definitely need friends playing this game to enjoy it fully solo can get boring
I m on the edge of my seat during every match Scanning the horizon Paranoid Looting Hiding Running Killing And eventually dying save my one Chicken Dinner You don t have to be a pro to enjoy this game and the gameplay is very unique but also familiarI ve been playing since Early Access and the game was well polished in my opinion for an Early Access title It was not without issues as you would or at least should expect with any Early Access game That said I have had and continue to have minimal technical issues with the game Despite some minor flaws this is a big thumbs up for originality execution  lol and damn entertaining gameplay
SHITTY game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server cheaters everywhere Chinese hacker LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dev REPEAT
Waste of money if you re thinking of buying it Game is completely unplayable with chinese invading all servers with high ping and cheats DEvs are clueless and most patches don t fix things they simply mask issues  Buy and play this game only if your life is so great that you actually need a reson to be dragged down and frustratedthis game will deliver that experience no problem
love this game
Ganda nito
worst game ever fix it u dumb LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  10IQ muts jump a cliff lose little to no health hits a rock does 4 flips then dies due to vehicle blowing up find more slit eyes on OC that Asian servers who cant speak english

Loot boxes are aids especially in PUBG
Amazingly good fun if you re playing in duo or a squad  
Very fun game but as of now 910 game u will run in to hackers
GOOD GAME WORTH IT FEW SERVER ISSUES BUT ALL G
Love this game I really do  But they really need to lock China to their own server 99  of cheaters are Chinese and nearly half of them play on the NA servers THey have 3 servers to choose from but decide to play on a server based half the world away Until they region lock the game I wouldn t reccomend it
W O W E E
910Seem to be some bugs but overall its a badass FPSBattle Royale setting is niceGraphics are amazin on ultraNeeds more maps and bug fixes
This game is so GOOD
I bought this game and also liked and played alot in 2 days i played it 14 hours and then i was banned suddenly wtf 3rd day i logged in my steam account i was banned completly you can see my states they poor no hacks or cheats still banned bobobo those chinesse developers
Thank for releasing this game and thanks for that because i don t have life anymore again
If they can get a handle of the rampant cheating and bugs it can be the best game of the decade Currently a steaming pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
instead of setting up better servers so you don t have to reconnect 12 times for a match and deal with the ridiculous number of chinese hackers and teamers pubg corp decided to  make a xbone port  make a mobile port make a desert map everyone doesn t want to play on make a jungle map that looks suspiciously like fortnite map successfully take the fun away from the waiting room actually went and sue trashy clone games for money calling pubg players xenophobic add tons of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hats and gun skinsI love this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game but come the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on stop shooting yourself in the foot
RegionLockChina  Although I am also Chinese
I liek des g4me but it cannot show me da way brudda
I ve had this game a week logged about 30 hours in it and I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing love this game  Yeah it can run weird at times and yeah there are a few cheaters out there but the game is fun in spite of all of that  Get a few friends to buy it and play as a crew with voice chat and you will have mad fun
Welp game is going to slowly turn into h1z1 its gonna die slowly but surely mainly because of the chinese cheaters was a fun game but now not so much there are tons of cheaters like tonsssss beware 1817 fpptpp leader boards were filled with cheaters And the devs aren t doing any  active  work to go against it Goodluck
I love this game except for when you die to a shotgun from a mile away with full health and level 3 everything
Great game except for a few glitches and crashes I really would like to see more maps though which I hear are coming soon
Gameplay is solid But the developers chose to go for a 6 gig update with clothing and paid cosmetics instead of fixing issues that has been here from the start GG Lost my vote
sucks cant connect to server
Great game very addicting
full of chinese hackers
Fun from times to times but way to many cheaters and hackersIf the developers put some efford into removing cheats and cheaters it might be a decent game at some point
real good game
If you are looking for a short answer whether to buy this game or not the answer is no NO DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  Dated Jan10 2018 If you want reasons jump into the extended review belowFirst of all I want to start by apologizing to anyone that has encountered hackerscheaters in this game I am Chinese and on behalf of the good non cheating part of Chinese players of this game I want to sincerely apologize to all of you I am sorry that the majority if not all of cheaters are Chinese I am sure you hate them I hate them too They are ruining this game I understand your regionlockchina thoughts but please know not all of us are bad There are even Chinese streamers cheating and Bluehole did not do anything about it Unfortunately I cannot elaborate here but new comers please note BLUEHOLE KISSES STREAMERS  ASSES AND THEY WOULD NOT HEAR PLAYERS OUTSecondly there are lasting server issues that is not fixed This review is dated Jan10 2018 almost a month after the 10 release You would think that server would not have issue after the game leave EA However during this month often player tagsnames and clothing items would not load when you enter a game This game still has server issue days before and after every patch There is said to be an update Jan11 and today I had played 5 games where 3 of them I could not enter at all and get connection timeout error pop up screen and other 2 of them I was killed by hackersThirdly there are several glitch through out the game and rubberband issues that severly hurt your gameplay experience In the lobby sometimes some of your friends would not show online even if they are Sometimes the team invitation will not go through In the  new  map where it is tested on the test server for almost 3 months there are spots you can fall through floors stuck in crates etc Regarding the rubberband issues I have experienced a lot of times where on my screen I am already behind cover for more than a second and in the killcam I was still exposed  PS I am playing on NA server in BostonFinally I would mention several things where the game did good even if in current state you should NOT buy it The killcam was asked for in the EA state they did add that into the full release even with minor glitches it helped a lot pinpointing hackers and cheaters There are obvious difference in killcam where one is hacking and one is just good The optimization is imporving with each patch I have experienced 30fps with GTX1080 in March 2017 to stably above 60fps in my current mid high custom settings The game itself is extremely fun and the adrenaline rush it gives after each kill each firefight each win is unparalleled Note  I am not going to discuss the incoming microtransaction because everyone has their own opinion about it But there is incoming microtransaction to be implemented into the game It is cosmetic onlyNote 2  If the hacking issue is fixed there is incoming Chinese server of PUBG run by Tecent hopefully it will take at least part of the hackers away then the game would be enjoyable and bearable as glitches and issues are being addressed and fixed At least they are doing something Will update review if issue is fixedAt last non Chinese speakers are welcomed to google translate this 
I really like playing this game HOWEVER the amount of hackers  primarily from China and desync due to ping driving is unreal This game needs to be region locked and Bluehole needs to deploy a real anti cheat system the system they currently have in place is useless If you don t mind the ping driving consistantly being shot through walls from the otherside of the map and flipping bikes on invisiable boulders then this is the game for you
Dis game show me da whey
Was a good game but now its hackers everywhere Region lock might help but this game is going downhill for now
This game is still horrible The devs at BlueBalls have no clue what they are doing The game runs a l ittle better but the issues with the servers dsync game crashing lag cheaters sound optimization are all still there this game should be free dont buy this for 30 bucks play fortnite
10  sure doesnt feellookplay or seem like a game in 10
I just love spawning across the map then getting killed by the wall with a 0  chance of survival  ALSOLoot crateshorrid rendering   I render buildings 1 mile away before the ones in front of me renderpeople from another unnamed country with pings in the million flooding the multiplayer flooding the north american servers ruining any chance of finding a teamate that speaks englishlootcrates lack of carsunderpowered sawed off
Love the new map on the game but wish I could pick between which one I want instead of at random
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THE YELLOW INVASION  NA SERVERS FOR NA PLAYERS  EAT A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  BLUEHOLE  CAN T EVEN DO RANDOM PICKUPS  DON T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE A MASTERS IN MANDARIN
Don t waste your hard earned cash on this until the Devs stop LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing around The problem is Chinese players account for half of the games population and 99  of hacks come from China When people ask for a region lock to fix laggy chinese speaking teammates and hackers the Creator  Brendan Greene Thinks you are racist Go buy another Game
Worst reward system ever seen mediocre graphics bad performance and a rising cheating invasion
Horribly optimised game With a GTX 1080 Ti and a Ryzen 1800x I still can t run it on high graphics smoothly at 120 FPS The frame drops are incredibly bad the graphics are ugly in the game I keep moving well after i ve let go of the key The physics are rubbish Don t pay for this game if you don t have a GTX 1070 or better because you will not be able to run it reasonably Game hasn t been changed or modified to help the majority to be able to play it smoothly Simple fixes that should ve been implemented in the physics to fix the movement haven t come to fruition for months now I would just forget that this game even exists because it plays like crap
Currently one of the main games I play and can see myself playing it for awhile Yes like all games there are cheaters but that does not ruin it Give it a chance you will not be disappointed
I don t know why people are saying that there are so many cheaters but there are not especially since they started cracking down on them Don t believe those theories you hear about them keeping the cheaters so they can buy marketplace items for more profit It s utter BS and stupid  and very time consuming for a said cheater which makes no sense in today s world This is a great game that I would highly recommend as long as you don t have a crappy computer An Intel i5 2500k and GTX 760 should be fine on optimal settings 1080p You don t want some of the settings high anyway Hope I helped and again it s worth 30 Could ve been 5999 like the rest
WADDU WADDU WADDU HECK     
I enjoy the game at times especially with friends but the plethora of small yet plentiful frustrations due to both the company s decisions and ideology continue to bring this game down  The inconsistent hit detection  Killcams occasionally bugging out  Players from different regions making ping inconsistent  Reintroducing paid crates but making players pay for the keys in the test server  where items DO NOT transfer over to the main inventory  BattleEye unable to keep up with the amount of hackers returning through each small patchThe company clearly has a different set of priorities and it s not in alignment with the communities If they want better reviews they d better cater to both sides of the community equally otherwise the beatings will continue
i WAS REALLY looking forward to playing this game a
This is very fun to play Seeing how long you can go and trying to survive is major key to this game Didn t think I would like it but boy was I wrong
A
I can describe this game in just 1 word   AwesomeAlone or with Friends  3 its still a lovely game
Great game
NA And EU servers are full of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in chinese people i have played like 5 hours but never found a squad talking in englishthis is BS
PUBG is awesome prepare to   jump into a crowded area get shot before you even saw a weapon or anenemy  jump into an abandoned area search nearby houses and shags find somegear and proceed to the circle get shot in the back with no idea wherethat guy came from  jump somewhere land with one or two other guys find no weapon and getshot into your face with a shotgun  survive the landing for some minutes find a weapon and try to hide pointyour gun at the only entrance of the room and wait Someone comes jumpinginto the room and no matter where you stand get a shot in the face  survive the landing and try to be  open sneaky  moving slowly from coverto cover Get shot from a sniper from some hundert meters away  hide again in a corner try to follow the gun shots the area went silentwait some more No sounds leave your hiding spot peak around a corner getshot in the face  stay in cover scan the area for movement no movement for some minutesand you need to reach the circle Leave your cover and get shot fromsomebody behind you  try to fire back even before your crosshairs is near the guy you are filledwith bullets  move towards the circle spot a guy moving in the same direction Don tshot he is too far away Follow silently use cover and keep an eye on himLose sight Get shot from that guy in the face  Align your shot carefully wait until he doesn t move aim for his headShot miss Guy turns around and you guessed it  Wait to the last minute until the zone is closing Run Look for avehicle none to be seen Run Scan the area while doing so scan for peopleand vehicles cross a street Get run over by a buggy coming from the area  you came from  Secure a vehicle and plan your movement Look for some desolate buildingsto wait for the next circle and plan your moves Reach the point and get   shot  Secure a vehicle and plan your movement Look for some desolte place wherenobody would be Reach the point and get shot  Acknowledge that you have to learn to aim better Jump into crowded areassecure a weapon and hunt Hear the fighting advance to it meet nobodySearch the area for possible targets find none Try to leave the area andget shot in the back  Watch some streamers on youtube or something to see how they play andrealise that you haven t the slightest clue how they pull that offThis game is awesome The times you are the guy who s doing the face shotingit feels great And beware the rare occasions where you get the chickendinner It s somehow like the best sex you ever had with an ice cold beerafterwardsUse the killcam and replay feature to witness how everybody is fasterhas better situational awareness is more precise and even luckier than youBe prepared for some serious swearing crying and utterly sobbing on your   part be sure to remove all easy destructible things nearbySome other points   Sound is broken at least for me The ingame voice worked for the firsttime i started the game I muted it because all the screaming in the lobby  and since that it never worked again no matter what i tried  Sound is broken i almost never hear any footsteps Until i use the  killcam or replay then i hear them clearly and i guess i would have had aslight chance to survive a bit longer if i heard them ingame  Lags are still a problem in early game when two or more guys race for thefirst weapons in sight as well in later game when you run for cover like acolumn and still take shots from your opponent while behind it  i really would like to play it in 4K but even my pretty fast gaming rigcan t do it  Ryzen 5 1600X 32 GB RAM Radeon RX Vega 64 2560x1440 is   possible with 60 fpsSo if you have a high frustration tolerance or are a highly skilled FPSplayer have fun to die in amazing ways a lot
Stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Bluehole Do not buy this game again do not buy this Game You will never get connected to the server forever forever do not buy this stupid game

this game low fps  50 60 at best even if u have an 1080ti with i7 8700k even shroud with that rig is getting low fps u see this game is full of really good optimizations stuttering thanks for a bad anti cheating implementation lag on items looting is really fun when u dont have any items to pickup because the servers are so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lagged that the loot appears 1 min after u land to the ground hit registration lag  they can kill you even if u are in cover the lag is really great 34 of your games are going to be with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers from china that wont speak english or will teamkill you
ehhhhhh
FREE CHUCK 88
Amazing game but will leave your computer gasping for air
Concept is great gameplay has a lot of bugs and issues  but this can be fixed The mayor issue are the Chinese Hackers You spend a lot of time looting and killing normal opponents to then be top 10 and get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed by a hacker Ruins the fun out of a game that has a very good concept Dont buy until they got a region lock or a solve for the hackers
sic game
Please dedicated a server for chinese IP met chinese cheaters everyday
You have to be prettty patient but the feeling when you a chicken dinner is worth it  super satisfyingIt might be kinda buggy but that gives it some character I think Fun to play with friends to just have a good time  That is if you have any good friends
It s a fun game Besides the hackers on the NA servers The AS servers are not so bad Worth getting
Fortnite is the real Btec here
This game is pretty fun and altough the shooting mechanics are good the graphics are awesome optimization is also ok considering how it looks i will have to give it a thumbs down for one reason that basically LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE es me over directional sound IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to figure out from where somebody is actually shooting from and it may not seem like a big deal but in this game where you have to pay extra attention to see the enemy player not knowing from where the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  he is shooting at you from is going to get you killed in most scenarios
Solo this game gets boring quick but if you have friends to play with its a game you could play all dayIf you re looking to play solo i wouldnt recommend it
AIDS has never looked so good in a game too many problems and way too many cheaters to be somewhat fun at this point
Hurts me psychologically to the point where i want to kill every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that has killed me in this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game
I usually don t write reviews but because I already have over 600 Hours in game I felt compelled to I ve mostly enjoyed the game for the months leading up to 10 release I have found that I really enjoy the Battle Royale genre and the feeling of success being the last man standing out of 100 players in a match Overall I have enjoyed the gaming experience that PUBG has to offer I love everything from the range of available weapons and attachments to the unique combat situations that arise throughout a round of play Once I started winning more frequently however I noticed I was running into more and more cheaters  mostly Chinese players joining NA servers Now whether or not this is just bad luck or PUBG s MMR system I don t know What I do know is that it has completely ruined the game for me and caused me to not even want to play anymore It is near impossible to join a Third Person server without having multiple cheaters in the game I enjoy TPP because it is what I m used to from my days in H1Z1 and it s a different look from traditional FPS games like CS GO I realize that people are reporting less of a problem with cheaters on FPP servers and I ll probably have to make the switch at some point But if my preference is to play third person I should be able to do so without the fear of having multiple cheaters in the game with me I find that my play style has changed considerably from what it was before knowing that there is almost guaranteed to be someone with an unfair advantage in any game I drop into The addition of the replay system has only confirmed my suspicions Most people don t even try to hide it Before I would play more in the open and take most fights I would encounter Now I find myself running from fights and moving from building to building to not get shot in the head from halfway across the map by a player with a SCAR aiming over their shoulder It absolutely just sucks I m not normally one to complain about anything hell I could care less about desync and subpar netcode at this point But from someone who used to really enjoy playing this gameplease pleaseget rid of the cheaters and give ALL OF US the peace of mind to know that we have a fair chance at winning any game we queue up for Ping Cap Region Lock better Anti Cheat whatever you have to do to combat this issuePlease do it
its                                                                   good
GOOD LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trash game same goes for the developers  Go play Fortnite instead
suck my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pubg dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing do that to fortnite
OverpricedToo many cheaterspoor developmenttrash game
Good game for a good price active community  albiet sometimes salty for no reason and active devs  despite the salty portion of the community complaining about itFor only having a few maps this game has a RIDICULOUS level of re playbility By simply switching up strategies OR using what the game gives you with random loot spawns totally changes the experience Worst part is the annoying mic spammers but on the flip side spamming dank musical memes while driving straight into an enemy held warehouse at 12am drinking with buddies which will probably lead to your demise are some good timesOh and First Person Perspective is where its at IMO
A very good game to play alone or with your teammates Dev are constantly improving it which is great One of my best games I guess The best battle royale survival shooter for sure
getted banned for no reason simulator 30 ok  eventually got unbanned so
this game still runs like a hot dumpster fire half the time and is just another dayz wanna be that sucks
Best  Battle Royale  game type I don t see a better battle royale shooter that is out or that would ever even top this monster of a game I disagree with how many negative ratings this game has pulled those are just haters of the game that are not typically good and use the errors of the game to back up their reasons as to why their are terrible at PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds rather than giving the game the credit it deserves Sure the game has lag you will encounter it especially in the early stages of the game when you first land and try to find a gun and pick it up However this game brings pure adrenaline and an exciting thrill in combat and getting that chicken dinner is just a cherry on top I would rate this game a solid 85 100  with how it has given the community the ultimate battle royale gaming experience
Very fun game to play with friends Good updates so far   not sure if the price is worth it but we agreed with a few friends to get it and we are having great fun Hopefully will see better uodates in future
Battle Royale  1 vs 99 Chinese hackers
1010 is a very nice with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  female body
Good Game in the year
DONT BUY IT lags bugs    
Only one win sometimes i rage but worth buy  Yes its good game when u know how to play it
Every server no matter what region OCE especially is filled with Chinese hackers
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE     
this game is trash do not buy hackers galore after a week of the patch dont expect much progression dont expect locked regional servers
So many cheaters
POS game that was released way before it was ready Crashes endlessly
BRUH WHY YOU BANNING ME FOR NO REASON LMFAO
This game is infested with Asain hackers and everytime one gets chopped about 10 more pop up010 would not eat rice again
This game has been ruined by hackers from a specific country  I would not recommend buying this game because the devoloper supports this behavior
China cheaters all the way tickrate from 2 to 30  5 desyncs 1010 would recommend to play  NO ACTUALLY
Haven t had problems with cheaters during my first 400  hours of playtime but recently I ve played against a bunch them The voice chat in the EU region is also filled with chinese people  AKA cheaters If you look past these things the game is great There has been some amazing updates recently  New map vaulting But I m not gonna recommend it because of the huge influx of cheaters
Regional Lock please The Chinese ruins the game
The Oceanic servers are infested with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s They don t speak a word of english and are a bunch of hacking cheating LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s
This game never really had a peak point it started out buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but at least there were no hackers then it slowly got less buggy and more laggy now it has just reached the worst point of all there is too many hackers the amount of chinese people and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like that playing the game and lagging like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  making it impossible to beat them and the general lag is just shithouse I honestly don t have fun playing this game anymore the only fun I had was chasing down some chinese guy while he screeched into his mic as I punched him in the head
Uhh banned   I play this game with my wife and spend most of the time running around only to live until theres about 30 people and then just dying from someone a mile away Now I wake up and try to hop on and I m f cking banned   FOR WHAT  DYING TOO MUCH   How do I recieve a 2 day ban without cheating using a mic or ever chatting with ANYONE  WTF pubg   Did I punch too many people in the stupid lobby  This is BS
I used to love this game many months ago  I never raged at the game then and to me then it was just fun nad challenging I later though admittedly stopped playing for quite a while After I came back to this game in early november before the release and playing a few games here and ther in the month prior  the game never felt the same to me again I noticed that I was starting to get irritated with this game for various reasonsIn summary after having enough experience in the game to at least be considered an  average player  here is my summary of the game Pros   Good graphics  Good and unique maps layouts and designs for both of the maps available after 10 release of the gameCons   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  RNG loot after a patch long ago  that happened after I stopped playing and came back making the gunplay very unfair I find myself walking into a room  The Weapon damage value in this game is awful  it takes often times 4 bullets or more to kill with an assualt rifle at the VERY LEAST IN MOST CASES  excuding desync and hit detection issues if they are at full health when engaged and 3 bullets to kill with a sniper rifle  Terrible desync and in some game the lag is absolutely enraging to top all the problem the game already has off But thankfully most the time you won t really notice the lagg when it happens unless you are in a fight and die from your enemy snap peaking a corner and killing you after the connection stabilizes again  Hit detection is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing atrocious  Character hitboxes in the game are not good but not entirely bad either but still could use some working on for sure  Players that are knocked out have just as much health on the floor as they did standing up  Many iron sights on many guns in the game are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because either the aperature of the sight is so tight that you feel like you re looking through paper punchouts or the in the sight the bar used to line the shot is so thick that you can t see anything Some example of guns with bad ironsights that I can think of off the top of my head are  AK is very similiar to trying to aim with a rail but slightly better SCAR mini Uzi AWM s are literally trying to aim with a rail mount with no indicator revolvers are just about useless M249 any pistol really except for maybe the P1911 and i m sure there is more guns in the game that have pretty bad ones that I just don t know about because I can never find those weapons that often  Bullet velocity like any other game that has it seems to be exaggerated but no so much in this game at far ranges but at relatively short ranged you can tell it is exaggerated More than half the time you will die to desync or a player that you didn t even see that either killed you in a couple seconds because they are camping in close range or you die to a player that you can t see because they are at distance and have incredible accuracy  Zones end up in dull open fields more times than not with the winning chance having more to do with luck that anything due to positioning  Parachute physics are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE I simply cannotrecommmend anyone to buy this game until improvements are at least made in the character hitboxes desync and weapon damage values The game feels like a beta game released as a full game It needs work still
An exellent survival shooter game 5 stars out of 5
This is game is fricking awesome but seriously the hacking issues make me feel want to refund it i played it like every single day but every day will face a hacker in the match Please fix this issues or people will start to ditch this game
A lot of you may see these PUBG negative reviews and that most of them are just from getting bans and glitches well this one isn t one of those First off I would like to say the new map is a super LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  update and I have no Idea why everyone is so hyped up about it The car spawns are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and you are likely to die to the zone because you wont find a car in time Unlike the old map it has the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iest loot there are no good unpopular areas to drop Even though vaulting was quite a good update I still dont like it because it takes a while just to vault over something you should be able to just walk up If you had a choice to pick which map you wanted to play I probably wouldn t be writting this Sure it isn t the worst game ever but for 30 usd I would 100  not recommend
Beast of a game
Basically unplayable at the current moment in timeHackers in EVERY SINGLE GAME
10 and still runs mediocre very mediocre on a GTX 1080I d recommend waiting until another major update for optimization
Great fun to play But crashes way too often for my liking Two hours of actual gameplay and the game crashed twice TWICE ruined a great run of mine and is a serious turn off when you can be enjoying a nice game thats going great and then boom runs gone Its angering because its not like the feeling of ooh if i was covering that angle I could have won nope its just the anger of doing nothing wrong  and the game stopping working I would like to give a recommended but feels like it crashes way to often for it to be completely enjoyable
I played 4 games 3 of the 4 games I was killed by blatant hackers The gameplay itself is fun but unfortuntely those odds don t sit well with me I ll choose to refund it before I hit the 2 hour mark
The first couple of days the game were wonderful  Truely a refreshing game style and play that had me playing  But after only a few days the hackers have taken over the game  I know there a releases saying the devs are working on the issue but it is NOT getting better it is getting worseAt this time I can not recommend this game  Even if it was a free game the speed hacks aim bots invisible walls no recoil etc etc etc  Name the hack well it s on this game nowI really wish steam would listen and offer refunds and punish the publisher for not adhering to there own terms and agreements  They sold a game that is now unplayable after only a few weeksSadAnd for those that think I am complaining because I lack skill well won myself a chicken dinner on the first night of playing so I think I know my stuff  Plus my 13 years of service badge on Steam should be considered a veteran on Steam
PUBG is a great game only getting better and better with every update
Don t waste your money on this garbage until they deal with the hackers ping problems and all the other bs
This makes me hurny
I would recommend this game if it weren t for the fact that 75  of the games I play there is a hacker the craps on the entire match I consider myself an above average player and I m more than willing to say  GG  to a good kill but 7510 times its BS The BattleEye system is a joke NEVER drive a motorcycle  you re better off exiting the game and I m sick of seeing deathcams where I am hidden and the bullet still happens to hit me I will continue to play this game in the hopes that they can do something about the cheaters But if they can t resolve the cheater issue this game won t be relevent for long on PC It ll turn into another H1Z1 pile of crap Thanx Brendan
Laggy  Looks like 10 year olds made it  Don t buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
neymar is the best player in foot ballsign my account with comment  D
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UInless you have friends this game is filled with people who cannot speak english in the North American Servers 
Buy this game if you like being killed by asian hackers almost every game This game used to be good but recently there has been a large increase in the number of people hacking this game It is almost like the anti cheat is doing nothing to actually ban the hackers and the developers haven t pushed out any patches to resolve the hacks
Im from China Ill sell hacks
Hi I bought this game last night I installed and when i try to click  play  i have a error that say   MSCVP140dll  i have window 7 64bit Can u show me how to fix it 
When is this game going to get a actual Anti Cheat system   complete time suck when you play 30 minutes into a game only to die from a headshot with a crossbow from 300 yards out by an asian hacker
Don t buy this game until they implement a region lock From lag to not being able to communiate to your team matesWhat a genius way to ruin gameplay
best game i ve ever played despite all the bugs and problems tha game has
E sports Ready
this game is goodbut now i get failed to initalize steam and cant play over a week nowi used to get around it but all the tricks have stoped workingthis only started when it went into full release  im not the only with this issue
There is some bugs but is a great game
every update equals worse lag hit detection and everything else you can think of so pubg take your chicken dinner and shove it up your huge    hole with your game
Good game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of hackersI ALWAYS used to give people the benefit of the doubt when they killed me I mean landing 2 headshots in a row isn t that hard But ever since they added death cam  basically allows you to see the perspective of the person who killed you I have about 8 gb of footage of me being killed by hackers in situations where there was literally no physical way for them to hit me The reason for this happens so much because there is literally a financial incentive to hack in this game if you can consistently win in solo games you can easily make over 10 000 bp in a 5 hour session which is enough to buy 5 or 6 lootboxes which can be sold for real moneySome examples of me being killed by hackers in solo games   standing by myself in a hallway with no windows or other openings guy standing outside aims at the ground shoots twice both head shots I die  standing about 500 meters away from a guy with a literal mountain in between us he aims at the ground shoots twice head shots me and another player killing us both instantly  standing alone in a building no cars ANYWHERE near me get killed by  vehicle explosion 
I had heard so many positive thing then so many negative things that I was unsure about this game When my friend got it I watched them play It looked fun but I dislike PvP based games as they more often that not bring out toxic players toxic behaviour etc and I didn t want that However as I watched I realised it was not as other games were when PvP was the sole basis of itSo I purchased it with the intent to only play it with them as a group experience I enjoyed it When I died it was fair Kill cam showed where I made a mistake and I would correct it in the next game The postives were all there The game style the choices lack of abuse The negatives were higly infrequent Rarely was there an illicit player or server lag Playing on OC had one lag spike for 5 minutes All other hours no lag Tried aother servers NA JapanKorea EU  while the typical distance latency was present there was no overt lag and it was playable even around the globe A surprise to be sureI don t know what this game was like personally before December 2017 Everything I have experienced thus far in 2018 has been enjoyable fair quality gamingOh and Ctrl  1 if you enter a vehicle not into the drivers seat to move the the drivers seat You cannot drive as a passeger ApparentlyI would as a non PvP gamer recommed this game
Please do something agains the hackers instead of posting BS about having banned about 60   How would anyone know that  Since you banned 15 Mio Players   and sold around 30 Mio Games means that there is sill around two Hackers in every Game
If you have anything less than top end gear skip this maybe it is a good game maybe it s fun but it runs worse than Unity store asset flips Can not recommend this in the slightest
As of January 2018 the KRJP server is riddled with cheaters The game is definitely not enjoyable in the current state
Are you a gear queer who likes to have 2 hour discussions about AR 15 muzzle devices or which tactical backpack you think will be optimum as your EDC on your drive from suburbia to your econ 101 class  Do you enjoy rubber banding like gumby and watching vehicles phase through space and time due to massive latency  Maybe you prefer getting stuck on geometry or clipping through doors or even the floor Or perhaps you enjoy clunky shooting mechanics and watching bullets curve around your foe  or around cover in to you a la Wanted due to the outstanding client side hit detectionWell then my Chinese friend PUBG is for you and all your aimbotting adventuresSeriously this game can blow me
Game is Okay fun but now full of cheaters  Watch them on the kill cam They follow you then when your in range you get blasted  or the bouncing crosshairs that auto lock on you when you come around the corner
Philippines Nambawan
this is a hackyard
Just at the current state that the game is in I can t recommend it to anyone right now  The hackers are what is ruining the game for so many people yes the glitches at times can be annoying but it s not a constant problem like Chinese hackers are  Seems like every other game you die from some BS hacker who isn t playing the game how it should be played  You need a better reporting system and create a region lock at least for now so you can really fix the problem  Region locks aren t  xenophobic  Greene they are necessary to make the gaming experience better for your players who put hundreds of hours into your game  It creates a better gaming community with better communication would reduce lag get a ridicoulus amount of cheaters out of the NA servers and create less stress knowing you are playing on a level playing field  You have the money you have the resources now fix itI just want PUBG to be fun again
game nh l  3
Games played out and boringBluehole is honestly the worst developer out there
preety much the only game i play
One problem until now after start matchmaking loading screen really take too long to show the game until the game already started I can hear the plane sound even the parachute but the screen always showing the pubg Please tell me how to fix FYI  My RAM 12GB
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iest game ever no hit reg constant lag
Full of chinese hackers
The amount of cheaters in this game is rediculous
Hackers on everygame now for months and getting worstnow you are not safe even inside the house with the new ching chong hackssorry but a game with this many hackers is a no
For it s full release the game has improved quite a bit though it still has problems The game is still horribly optimized and the minimum requirements listed on steam do not feel very accurate With a gtx 1080 nvidia reccommends everything to be set on the lowest possible settings so I would ignore those suggestions if you are using the geforce experience   so there is a disjoint in the settings with the driver as nvidia claims the game can be ran at ultimate settings on 1920x1080 on their website So if you can handle the still constant crashing and a very vague  optimal settings  from both the game and nvidia then you will be fine otherwise steer clear of this for a long while
Buy this game if you want to experience hackers in every single game The game in this state is literally unplayable I have loved playing this game and every now and then you would get a hacker and you d just take it on the chin But now the game has been out for a while my guess is the hacked client is easier to aquire because now its the complete opposite where you only die to someone who isn t hacking once every 20 games I m also not sure if blue hole has combined the OC and ASIA servers into one as it seems like there is way more asians playing the game Wouldn t recommend buying this game until this whole hacked client BS gets shut down
don t play this game if you are talented playertoo many cheaters and blueLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  can do nothing

I bought this game because of the rave and popularity  Dec 2017 It wasn t very expensive and they finally came out of alpha so I reckon it would be stable enough to finally try it Alas it is a mixed experience Dont get me wrong the game itself is rather addictive   the whole trying to survive gets shot die and then start all over again routine But I think the biggest problem with this shoot em up game isthe shooting The weapons are inaccurate and Deathcams shows that the hit boxes are inaccurate as well There isn t a lot of consistency to the aims and accuracy Other than getting a scope any other ways of shooting usually means a hit or miss chance You cant really train to improve your shooting  ie CounterStrike for this game Also since this is a fully online game the netcode appears to over compensate laggers too What this means is a player with poor lagging internet will still see your  shadow  eventhough you have left the area few seconds ago He can shoot this  shadow  and you still get damage and die It is horribleCurrently lots of player movements and animations are still missing from the game example players getting in and off from vehicles has no animation They just blink in and out of vehicles So one second you are shooting at the driver inside the car the next second he simply vanishes in a blink You wouldn t even know if he got off the car on the left or the right side This is especially bad if the car has other passengers The same holds true for many other actions players simply blink into their next position or actions Making this game hard to know what the other players are actually doing   too much guess work Finally would I recommend this game  I will still say probably NOT right now until the anti cheat is as mature as other online games CheatersHackers are rampant And worse the dev refuse to enable region lock so cheaters can jump into other regions and spoil the game for other countries So right now this is game is definitely not a complete experience
This game is currently unplayable due to all the hackers playing so right now it isnt worth getting
Some of the most online fun i ve had in a while but bugs and rough servers and optimization kind of hold it back  Rightnow i d give it a 710
PUBG has quite possibly one of the worst  official  releases that I have ever seen I won t waste my time with verbacious rhetoric These are the simple facts of PUBG Firstly the official release is just a scam As some other user said this was just a way to make more sales over the holidays Don t let the fact that they removed PUBG from early access make you think that the game has mostly gotten rid of its flaws Quite the opposite Since the official release I have been getting significantly more glitches and issues than I ever got in early access and that s saying a lot Issues that I never experienced in early access and now experience in the official release  Rubber band lagHealth bar constantly messing up  eg I ll be shot by someone but the health bar will only display me taking damage about 3 seconds after I was actually shotArmor durability glitches which are pretty much the same thing as the health bar issues  eg I take damage and my armor takes about 3 seconds to actually register the damage that it tookExtremely wonky vehicle physics These have always been in PUBG and the new update has made them better other the fact that now when you go over a single pebble you ll be launched to PlutoThese are just a few of the wondeful issues you have to look forward to and keep in mind these are only new issues in the update that I ve experienced There are still issues from early access that they completely ignored fixing in there  OFFICIAL  release such as but not limited to  Randomly being put into the wrong servers every single gameLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  netcodeAnd random network connection issuesThe one positive thing that I ll say about the new update is that I get significantly better frames and the graphics look slightly better With all of this being said I can t recommend this game as the developers have completely slacked with the production of this game and still had the audacity to take their game out of early access without fixing anythingDespite these issues the gameplay while usually boring does have some fun moments that keep you coming back for a while 410
It is the same game over and over again  Good luck trying to mix it up because no matter what it ends with walking  driving for 20min with lack luster firefights  If you want a true look into the game what some small youtuber s video and not pros or compilations
http steamcommunitycomiddoomsay3rYar died to redzone twice send him hate and make fun of him
Servers are garbage and kill cams are either terribly inaccurate or every player has aim hacks Maybe they haven t made enough money off of 3 million concurrent users to afford to optimize their product
Hacker in every region Impossible to play And the company is definitely buying some recommendations on steamFxxk the server for the event mode
Chinese hackers ruining the game was a good game but hackers every game now goodbye
The menu music is on point
Fun and entertaining while remaining challenging and fresh It is a tragedy that so many players are from foreign areas and spam the chat  but that s only a problem in pre game lobbies
anyone can help me  how to fix PUBG need to upgrade your game client  i try to restart my computer 3 times but same something has wrong to my file PUBG thanks
The game play is the same as DayZ without the zombies and with a circle that narrows the battle The combat is god awful   hit registry is a complete mystery and recoil is off the charts Listen to the top players even say the game is broken   yet it is still fun and likely worth the money
God Awful game Literally makes CS GO seem more fun as well as Fortnite Don t buy this Trash
Thanks China
this game aint wort LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  NA and EU is unplayable because of chinese hackers
This review will become positive once a region lock is put in place I d honestly like to play squad or duo with people I share a common language with
I love this game and have been playing since it first went live on Steam  I have tons of hours of fun with friendsHowever this game is now rampant with aimbots  Roughly every 7 out of 10 games I die due to hacks  Some are as obvious as VSS third person shooting through hills  I know the kill cam i bugged a little right now but this is definetly not a bugThe game has over 3 million concurrent players and 125 million have been banned since last patch  Clearly you guys are trying to resolve the issue but almost half the player base is cheatingI hope you guys fix this soon because in this current state I cannot reccomend this game to anyone
very good game so ez i win every time and chinese every where 910 gg ez
Game full of hackers 5 games played today killed 5 times by a hacker
When i first bought this game i actually enjoyed it it was one that i was actually pretty good at Now its filled with nothing but cheaters from LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing china shouting  CHINA NUMBA 1  the entire time while they hipfire headshot you 10 times with an sks from 600 meters out LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game DONT BUY IT UNTIL THEY FIX THEIR BROKEN LOVE LOVE LOVE  ANTICHEAT Seriously dont get it

Great game my only issue is the cheaters lately have gotten out of hand
Fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing looting system please gets quite frustrating running through 4 houses and walking out with only a level 1 backpack and a flash
Extremely fun game especially with the new update made the game so much cleaner totally reccomend
laging as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Really fun to play First 10 20 hours goes just to learn basics in this game After that its pure fun Playing with squad or duo if more fun than playing alone
Don t buy this game a lof of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing chineses hacker
this game is so good in scar l with supresor and double magazine btw im so gud in inglish btw im from romania
if you like an intense adrenaline rush and smaching your keyboard Its worth every penny
The game is fun when you don t get killed by a hacker Unfortunately there s a hacker in every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game The NA server is riddled with Asian players who spam  China 1  every second if you play solo squad and get teamed with them you might as well suicide they won t even revive you If you re from NA try playing on the AS server the lag will help you like it helps them on our server and you ll meet next to no hackers because they all play on the NA server IF and WHEN the hacker problem gets fixed the game will be worth buying Right now don t waste your money on it until this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing cancer is cured Also their official forum is full of spambots that they barely take care of and their Zendesk customer support is near non existant Get your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together considering the money being made from the sales of this game this is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing disgraceful
the gamedesign is just horrible no fun at all just random and frustrating
no game is perfect this is an example Alot of these negative reviews are about teh mirco transaction but those are all accesories they add nothing to the game and the real game is actually really fun with friends or alone great game but had some bugs like most games do
The network of the server is awful Lots of delay and playback totally not playable

 Playerunknown s Battlegrounds  or you could shorten it to  PUBG  Nevertheless this game is far from a masterpiece but still holds quite a place in pc gaming as this game is basically a highly budgeted and worked on mod of previous battle royale game modes from popular titles such as ARMA H1Z1 and DayZGameplay wise this game lacks a variety of goals sure the main objective of each and every multiplayer match you partake in is to achieve first place out of 90 to 100 players This may seem easy to some but it once a game or two of solo is played you start to realize that this will take some practice practice which is only obtainable in an online session Yes the widely praised phenomenon known as  PUBG  does not have an  offline mode  now this is not what makes the game BAD LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  rather the lack of a training area where you can try each and every weapon and item out in the game before you go out to shed some blood Now there is a type of training area in one of the preparation phases for one of the two maps  as of writing this but as soon as you manage to get to one of the weapon benches you may only end up with one firearm to test out before you get shoved into a plane This shows that a large skill gap between players is present in the game as not everyone has the time to try out every gun themselves before a match starts while the other dedicated player are able to wipe the floor with newcomers who may expect a tutorial which they will never get other than the pop ups telling you which button does whatThe lack of an offline mode is a real punch in the gut for me when I play this game although there are areas of it that shine and if worked on may be able to compensate for the supposed inability to add singleplayer testing grounds Where this game lacks for in features it makes up for in character customization there are an abundance of t shirts pants and hats for your character to wearI feel I have written for too long so I will say this  PUBG is an intense fight to the death shooter that requires patience skill and a lot of frustration management I will give this game an 810 for the reasons I have listed above Yospy
I changed my review to bad devs are overwelmed with player counts cheating is rampant and the game crashes every 3 games rejoining a game  windows fullscreen is a must after ending the process of this game has been done way too much from me and my friendsI uninstalled the game after many hours of playing and getting frustrated by random BS game will dip right before i get shot with a massive amount of bullet then i have no choice but to die getting random HP lose from normal parachuting dying from vaultingyes the devs are working on this game but as I can see making wearable items and paid crates are more important to them
don t buy this game if you still want to have a social life
This game where do i start Besides its occasional lag and bugs it was good i played 300 hours before 10 and now this game has gone to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  It feels like every match i play i get killed by hackers whether its instantly getting team wiped with an uzi all headshots in 1 second or us all getting our heads blown off with a pistol from 500 metres away and im pretty sure guns dont shoot throug walls in pubg theres also a reason for servers being named after where you live Unfortunatley people joining the wrong servers causes a lot of toxitcity on the starting island and things escalate to racisim As i am wriitng this review my friend Marsyy was sitting next to me playing pubg and was just killed by another hacker This game was my new go to game i basically left everygame to gather dust because pubg was the new best thing not anymore From 1010 to 210i would recommend this game but i cant not until something happens about the cheaters
I used to love this game but the hackers are getting worse and worse and blue hole does nothing about letting all the chinese hacker come to the na server and does not about cause they are making bank for this hackers
this is one of the best games that i have and i recommend it to people who like shooter games or for anybody
After 140 hours after the early acces after  many  updates and patches the game is still trash The point is you will still be nervous because of the game and the errors it gave youCrashes   Many many many crashes opening the game   middle game   finishing the game   EVEN IN THE MENU You will still have crashes no matter many errors from missing files crash reports etc After you try to beat the game it finally works until the next crash appearsFreeze   I ve just lost my match with my full squad because the game freeze and after  of course crash This is why I m posting this negative recommendation  In the first game opening my game freezes for like 10 minutes and I don t have anything to do but wait This sucksCheaters   Almost anywhere you play there will be a hacker  mostly AS So don t bother fighting them just report and move onThese 3 are the most LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iest things in PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS And of course you shoot first but still diedI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME ONLY IF YOU HAVE A LOT TIME TO SPEND FOR IT AND YOU STAY WELL WITH NERVES
It s too much fun   fraustating at different time period Definitely worth a buy
Best Game Ever  Put more new generation guns  add new vehicles  tanks
ahaaaa yeah pre good game pretty messed up but still fun fauaarrr yeaah
This game offrers a dynamic that is different than a lot of games I have experienced The interactions with people in and out of the game are great endless laughs and fun or serious gritty gun fights showdowns and the occasional backflip on a motorcycle while shooting an M16A4 at an enemies facial features Endless fun to be had playing this game
Amazing concept Hope they keep updating it
gud stuff
The amount of cheaters is insane  im tired of getting butt fucked by chinese hackers over and over again
I know a better game
Many funs
Too many hackers as of now id recommend a better anti cheat software
CAONIMAGEB MAMA 
This game was soo fun at the start getting our first Chicken Dinner was amazing until patch 10 came out though almost every round we play we loot find good stuff fast and kill a few at the startThen late game die to a hacker who will shoot through two buildings with a SKS with a 8x scope full autoing headshot it s a load of garbage don t buy this game anymore until they fix the major hacking problem they have within it
Pubertis 
If you enjoy hackers in every round you play garbage hit registration and god awful optimization This game is the game for you The 10 is the only major change to the game basically since launch and that only fixed random in game features I have never hated a game the entire time I ve played it like I have with this one
Game relies on luck
this game is so dead by the fucing hackers
i am having a problem with this game  it is showing msvcp140dll is missing  any solutions for me i really wanna play this game
The game itself carries a beautiful concept which prvoides  you with a unique gameplay experience of battle royale a mode where you struggle to survive in a ruthless fight with 99 other players I d give 1010 for the idea but PUBG doesn t really meet the needs of players I won t say anything about optimization that s a well known issue of this game so if you don t have a superb beast of a machine don t even try it   NB  last patches improved the situation a bit First 10 15 hours feels like something incredible Your heartrate increases palms sweaty knees weak arms heavy you know that feeling don t you  The game makes you taste adrenaline tremble in horror when you encounter a possible enemy in a local villiage and feel jubilant after securing top1  But having played around 50 hours in total   Part of it on my friend s PC  You re becoming sick and tired of all that repetitive gameplay Yes it felt great in the beginning but as soon as you have learnt the gameplay patter it becomes dull and pathetic Basically any match you play comes down to 2 things  getting a good rifle some medications at least lvl2 armor and helmet and THEN just moving to the innercircle area and trying to secure a good spot for yourself This is probably the only game ever that tells you  Hesitate Don t take the risk Sit here and watch them kill each other  I ve taken top5 around 7 8 times without even killing other players just by hidding and waiting for a good moment Is this game competitive  I don t think so ANOTHER PROBLEM  is that looting system in my opinion doesn t really make the player go for it check every building loot villages and towns As mentioned before you simply don t need much stuff and the amount of loot which spawns literally everywhere is just INSANE Usually you easily get a M16 or M4 with several upgrades so you don t give a damn about other weapons   who needs shotguns and pistols  As the fight almost always happen in a wideopen area you only need an automatic rifle and you just get rid of your UMPs MicroUzi pistols and stuff There s a very limited pool of weapons mostly because of the spawning chances THIS LEADS to another conclusion  you re not really that intrested in killling people if you want to secure a top10 or higher The game doesn t reward the player for being the fastest hand in the West You re not intrested in the loot other players have because 90  of things you had already gathered yourself long before you met an enemy thus it is almost always better to avoid fighting because you ll only risk yourself or reveal your hidden position Yeah sure when you re in top12 15 you re forced to battle with other players but again it comes down to your initial position you obtained earlierTHE SHOOTING in the game is great though It requires a lot of skill and practice which really makes the game way better than any other games in this genre So what do we have  We have a CS GO in an open world where instead of buying weapons you have to find them yourself and then meet the foes far away in the middle of nowhere You re great at shooting and got the best loot possible  Good there ll always be somebody who is happy to shoot you in the back or meddle in a fight when you re not checking the other angle Don t get me wrong it is fun in a certain way   even a worse player can win The problem with PUBG is that it doesn t reward risky play much The only thing which gives you an advantage is a paradrop with AWPanother good gun but this is the only thing currently present in game Whether you land in a big city or a small villiage the chances you ll get everything you need are almost even Above all there s no point if fighting until you reach top 20 because you won t get anything but another round of bullets you will not use anyway   Seriously who the hell  needs 200 ammo for M4    and maybe some bandages to the 500 you already have That s what it feels like when you re playing solo What I d like to see from the devs is implementing more rare loot and rebalancing this systemHow about adding more top loot places faraway from the centre of the map or making another map with like a megapolis architecture which will force players into close combat areas  What if players could bleed and you couldn t stop that with painkillers or energy drinks   Same goes to breaking legsarms losing sight and etc   In other aspects the game is great But I still have to give it a negative mark mostly for the optimization issues and that repetitive playstyle
You like chinese hackers with pinch of cancer to go along with you came to the right place
PUBG   krl jeeli chodzi o battle royal 
I shoot I die I like
I ll say this   if they can get a handle on the hacking it is a great game But about 14 games I come across has someone hacking It gets super old and makes it rough to get invested into it
Seriously when are you going to address the cheating issue  Maybe you should have never given us kill cam so we weren t aware how easy it is to blatantly cheat with no repercussions Then when I complain people say  just play first person less cheaters  Why should I have to stop playing the game mode I enjoy just to account for the fact the developer doesn t care about the player base Oh and thanks for the emotes instead of a funtioning anti cheat you really know how to prioritise
good game but too hard for noobs
meh its prity good sometimes
I don t really understand the overwhelming amount of hype behind this game I bought this game to play with friends and honestly I just absolutely hate it I ve never played the game solo and always with a party This only made the game a bit more fun but it still won t change the boring non engaging gameplay mechanics Majority of the matches fall under one of the two scenarios 1 You drop somewhere with a lot of other players and you get rekt within minutes of landing2 You drop somewhere sparsely populated and you run around the huge empty map for 30 minutes doing pretty much nothing then all of a sudden you get killed unexpectedly out of nowhereFor most of the matchs the amount of gunfight you re engaged in is very minimal and you often die without getting any kills at all This kind of gameplay is extremely boring to meFrom the technical point of view PUBG has to be the buggiest game I have ever played The game performs extremely poorly in general as you often experiance significant FPS dips or freezes frequently occuring at random The game would also sometime crashes for no apparent reason The game servers themselves are often laggy at really inconvenient situations and desync is a major issue often encountered frequently in a match as well To top it off I ALWAYS lagdesync whenever I get shot How do you expect me to play a game that lags when you re dying Given these boring gameplay mechanics and horrible performance issues I really do not understand how a game like this can even become so popular
I may not be a seasoned reviewer but I can tell when devs put effort into something and this game has barely any of that the only battle royale game I ve seen who have devs who care about their game is fortinte and epic games really care about their game with weekly updates and new content but PUBG corp Don t give a damn and as of now all I can see is that they only care about the money
Enjoyable and no glitches or problems so far 1010
Post war LT Dan runs better than this game
As soon as you get into the last 10 cheaters heatshot you
Just started getting addicted to this in the past couple weeks runs so much smoother than when i first bought it roughly 6 months ago
come join the best looting and running simulator out there if you like high action shooters then this game is not for you nothing like running 30 min not seeing a single soul then dying from the zone or getting shot in the head from a chinese hacker
I EFFIN  LOVE PUBG Whether you decide to land hot and fight through the ten players that landed with you or land safe and stealth your way to the final circle this game is always intense and requires you to stay on your toes It s great heart pounding fununtil you and your squad drop dead in the most secure room in a house with no other players around You watch your deathcam and realize you ve been headshot by a cheater on the other side of a hill with his AWM pointed at the sky It wasn t ideal but I could deal with running into these hacks every ten games or so It s way beyond that now I can t go more than one or two games without being killed by a cheater Because of this I wouldn t recommend anyone buy the game at this moment As an aside I can understand allowing users to select which server they want to play in but something needs to be done about the flood of Chinese players in the NA and other servers I don t know enough to comment on the ping advantage they might get but I can say that it is immensly annoying when I use the in game team finder and get Chinese partners that can t speak English The inability to communicate to your partners is a major hinderance I shouldn t be forced to find alternative ways to build a team in PUBG just so I can communicate in my own language If the cheating and the server jumping were fixed I would tell anybody and everybody to buy this game immediately
EDIT  Even if the cheating issue is fixed this game is severely unpolished and disgustingly boring waste your time with Fortnite if you don t want your brain to rot cash freeHow to play Be ChineseGet your epic hacks readyCongratulationsRegion Lock this game we aren t Xenophobes Bluehole you re just idiots
Full of aimbots Infact there is more websites selling aimbots then there is selling the game Played a few times all was fair Last game watching back on deathcam Someone named     ZHI Shoot me while running without looking and aiming It s hard to explain You d have to see it He wasn t even close to aiming on me He wasn t aiming infront for bullet time He was yeards behind Not worth your money on PC
Edited review back to positive because I see way less hackers recentlyDefinitely a fun game with friends there are some bugs and some weird things happening at times but its part of the charmI would just recommend not playing on mondays because that s when hackers are usually farming crates since the reset is monday
rEALY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING sIcK MAn
FULL OF 1 HACKERS2 BUGS3 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  SERVERS
An Excellent game highly recommended if you want to play an FPS with consequences The lack of respawn makes the tension of a gunfight or the final circle stand out and more then once i have jumped out of my seat when shot at late game The hackers aren t as bad as many would have you believe In my 300 odd hours i ve only encountered two people I suspected of hacking  Though I only play on the NA server and speak for the others

best game ever made   fun in solo games fun in squad games   buy and enjoy
Laggy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Literally it has taken them months with all our LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing money   and where does it go  To making another LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing map while the game still does not LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing work Its the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing Korean developers or some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   China number one   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hackers as well I m glad they added a death cam into it   now i can see some Asian kid with  121212324  for a name firing 50 meters ahead of me and still killing me The only reason as to why this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game has done so well is due to the unique ideastyle Asides from that you ll drop down onto the map and experiance textures not loading or the game freezing AT THE WORST POINTS as if it was on LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing purpose Yeah anyway this review was made several minutes after i was killed via the amazing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing freezing  i m going back to another match now
this game is horse LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but someone ate it and then threw it up and proceeded to slather it all over their body and then they mixed it with sour cream and made muffins with the strange LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  horse cream mixture they created
Despite it s bugs and flaws the game is extremely fun Even if you do run into a glitch or issue more often than not they re more entertaining than annoying especially if your playing with friends and you get to experience it together For example two vehicles will collide and launch hundreds of meters into the air The game is very cool very fun and especially so after the 10 patch It is very addicting and absolutely worth a buy
It seems that the developers are dedicated to continuing the expand and improve PUBG  Kudos to them
Just wanna play a bit of duo or squad but cant because on OC everyone speaks Chinese and everywhere else the lag is too highLove the game hate the servers
enjoy the whole aspect of the game just need to stay on top of cheaters and a little more stuff to work towards for the average player
Great for playing with friends Hate when cheater goes
Worth the investment based of timemoney spent but real lovehate relationship and unfortunately there are too many cheaters at the moment for Love to prevail Find a way to make it happen and clean up this gameEdit April 18  feel like the situation with cheaters really improved Now that it seems better at least time for new content
NA server is also full of hackers
I really want to love this game BUT with theese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers u cant play this game Its the biggest lag party ive ever seen I really had hope they would fix this until 10 but still after its release its the same laggy gameI cannot recommend this game at its current state   sry
Awesome game will be the best game of 2018
too many hackers ruinng the game
I loved this game in development the game is greatUnfortunatly 56 games today killed by aimbotingwallhacking cheatersI want my money back
It ain t fun when you encounters cheaters every match nor how bad it s optimized Fix your god damn game with the money it provided you with
very fun game if u play with friends creates a lot of funny and raging momentsbut now since the hackers took over its nearly a waste of timethe game is dead soon if there s no solution for this
good game ecks dee uwu
great idea well funded over funded infact but with lazy lazy lazy execution  playing this game will dramatically reduce the lifespan of your GFX card as it kills itself trying to run this unoptomised poorly coded bundle of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I run a high end gaming rig virtually silent on most high end games with PUBG my PC is trying to explode itself into flamesThe netcode is equally terrible with hits frequestly failing to register only for the high pinger to turn calmly in your spray of bullets and one shot youWhat is acceptable in an early access game is not acceptable in a full release  Note to the delveopers  adding vaulting system to an unfinished game does not make it finished Greedy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers simply pretended the game is finished cashed in and went on holiday with your game dollarsTo be balanced the game mode is genius it gives a real sense of tension and jeporady but after time it is overshadowed in fact utterly destroyed by the abysmal executionI really wanted this game to be amazing but with many early releases that get your cash up front it fails to deliver a finished product  I really hope a decent developer can take this idea and produce it in a playable formatMy advice avoidPS the level of hackers in recent days is further indication that the developers have locked up and gone home  RIP PUBGPSS it crashes a lot now particularly when driving
I love the game don t get me wrong but I played about 7 games straight and every one of those LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s were cheating with an aimbot it is complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t that this great game needs to be ruined by some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers that have nothing better to do than ruin other peoples fun I ll change my review when they get an even better hold on what those no life LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  are doing but until then it s up to you whether or not to get it EDIT  Still like the game but now one of my friend s who if you play with you would completely understand that he has never used a hack before got banned from PUBG if you look at his ranking you would never even consider that he used hacks We were in a match and gettiing shot at by some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er using an aimbot using a Scar L and getting headshots with nothing but hipfire those people never get banned but someone who isn t even good enough to seem like he s hacking get banned that s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing problem so if you ve read this far I would say don t get the stupid game until they can fix that horse LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of a system for banning
This game has enormous potential but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone it its current state The game is multiplay only   this is great apart from the fact that the game is RIFE with hackers and their hacks are truly game breaking I d strongly suggest holding onto your money and passing on this one until the Dev s have taken care of the hacking problem Until then this game will only bring you frustration
I never play TPP game before   some FPP mode is very goodBest game 2017
if you dont like intese games THIS IS NOT FOR YOUbut i liked it
Cheaters everywhere and Bluehole obviously has no idea how to stop them
I can t play this game anymore because IS FULL OF HACKERS  DO LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SOMETHING 
THIS GAME HAS GONE FROM HONDKK TO WORSE FFS FIX BATTLE EYE OR GET A BETTER HACKING PREVENTION SOFTWARE The hacks are real any body who reads this plz dont waste your money on this game plz crate drops are crap chinese hackers and bluehole allowing hackersAll you get with this game is a big F ck You thats all
I am begging you  put a region lock on this game  It s amazing but the chinese hackers are killing me   git gud  NOIt s also not fun playing with people who only understand single words   drop    help    hi buddy 
A great game bogged down with poor optimization and hackers Why is it so popular  No clue But if you wanna play a really fun game ruined by poor development decisions  for the time being play this game By no means is the game bad
Great game a really fun idea at its core  100 man king of the hill I meanCheaters using hacks have completly ruined this gameThe developer is working hard to address the cheating but has failed
best game of steam  D
10 and servers are still really bad   lag spikes loot doors and player interractions not registering in the beginning of the game just ruins the entire experience If you ve got a bad connection you need to hide and wait for some people to die so the servers can support your gameplay
Good game  Yes I have run into a hacker but only 1 hacker in 30 games is not terrible  Overall good game that is enjoyable
Great game but still dont have first person mode in South America servers
How to kill someone    Shoot them nahhhhh  Roadkill LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yea  my wallet10  
Prob one of the best time wasting friend playing games out there Great fun with the squad and if youre lucky meet new people on there
Its fun yeah but only with friends But yeah its horribly optimized but itll get there
zhangfufang664 killed YOU with headshot

Mmmmm me likey Except for the damned chinese Lets get a region lock going
Pretty funny game but many bugs hold it down Sound should be reworked It s confusing It s very difficult to hear where the sound is comming from when your inside a building Combat is very fast and decides something that you spend a lot of effort on so it s really dissapointing when the combat is laggy rubber band and generally klunkyYou could go on Fix your game
Potential to be a very fun game ruined by LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server performance and terrible optimization Development team chose to spend time rushing console release out of fear of Fortnite  an actual optimized BR game Hopefully the dev team is able to spend time focusing on actual optimization and maybe some more new maps weapons or gamemodes Will consider changing my review to positive in the future
Increase the protection against hackers there have been at least one in ever single game and fix the maps it would be better if you could choose which one you were gonna play also optimize the new map miramar a lot more every time there is 5 or more people in one town i lag a lot
LOVE LOVE LOVE  game broken dependet on rng and broken vehicles Go play fortnite worth its price
Dont buy it you cant trade skins and game is full of bugs
Extremely fun game especially in team play
Servers are too busy at the moment Please retry later
Great Battle Royale
Not PUBG just PWUL  Playing with unreal laggs
Best game of 2017 This game is each time thrilling eventhough its a online only game and just for that respect to player unknown and bluehole studios
it s pretty good
wow LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  please fix this i get stuck at the loading screem even tho the game ahas already startedi know the game has started cause i could hear myself falling and pulli the shoot
devolope your server please
lyfe
Not gonns lie Good times and bad ones but in the end it s a fun game
The new patch helped out a ton  10 I really enjoy this game mostly with friends tho Cuz in solo I see alot of hackers and campers910
This game is growing more and more on meHeaps of fun and challenging at the same timeGet dat chicken dinner
Good for the price but not a finished game
game is absoloutly amazing except i watched a guy get hit directly in the head by redzone bombs and live 2018BUFFTHEREDZONE
Just a good overall game that will get even better in the future
This game is very intense and fun AF If you are having texture issues download Reshade This program makes the graphics in the game look so much better and brighter
 What do you mean this wasn t H1Z1 Eh oh well better anyways 
Great gameBIG PROBLEMS Huge influx of hackers latley run into on every game using a scripts and auto aim to fire assult rifles 2Xs as fast as they are ment to be fired they auto correct for the recoilAlso the chinesse are everywere The game needs to be region locked so you can t play outside your region Also something of a language lock would be nice so you can be sure you will be able to comunicate with your team Tl Dr   Not recomneded bc influx of chineese hackers on american servers
this game such a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing in the batlle and this game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing crushed i have gtx 1080 i 7600 and ssd on 1 TR tell me whyyyyyyyy this game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
battle royale
I SERIOUSLY CANT TAKE THE CHINESE PEOPLE NO MORE I CANT UNDERSTAND THEM
This game went downhill on launch  If you play SQUANDS in the NA servers there are only chinese players with obvious spam accounts that teamkill and get angry if NA server players dont speak chinese The amount of racist trashtalk towards NA players from chinese players in chinese is crazy I play with chinese speaking players who are able to translate I dont mind playing with people from other countries even if they dont speak english at all but why do NA server players only get matched with rude chinese players instead of other NAUKSA players who want to play the game and arnt spam accounts The game is almost unplayable in squad settings
I really liek the gameplay even tho it can be stressful lmao The game crashes often for me and isnt the most optimized game but still fun
Without cheats 1010 With cheaters 010
Good game   
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game that always crashes
its fun  
CHING CHONG CHING CHONG
Cheater paradise
Has gotten a lot better in gameplay Just needs to work on the lag in the beginning of games
Love it have a blast playing with friends
I m sure this is not a game where you camp for 10 min to end in 2nd position Need to know more about how to play
R E G I O N L O C K PLEASE
Wanna play some Last Man Standing 
great game you should add more vehicles to ride
No ping lock NA servers filled with players from Asia
43 100No words _ 
This game is a lot of fun especially with a group of friends but it is currently being ruined by hackers The developers have shown an unwillingness to address the issue  most likely because it is currently more profitable for them to just soft ban the cheaters and allow them to make a new Steam account and buy another copy The real way to fix this game is region lock but Playerunknown  Brendan Greene has gone on record saying that a region lock would be xenophobic So ya politically correct culture and social justice wins again TL DR   810 but 110 with rice
Game has made massive improvements since launch pre 10 update Vaulting was a very welcomed feature that improved quality of life drastically as well as added further depth to the gameplay Don t expect to do insanely well your first games this game has a huge learning curve in terms of looting positioning and gunplay Gunplay is one of the best within the FPS genre from ranged battles to close quarters the engine shines most with gun combat Weapons are balanced to an extent but assault rifles almost always take priority for success in late game Solo play is some of the most engaging single player multiplayer I ve experienced in a long time  but adding teammates in duos or squad play adds more depth and plays differently with a faster pace Current issues are lack of ping locks to stabilize pings in NA servers something Bluehole has stated they are working on currently If you like shooters free for all style combat and unpredictable chaos PUBG is for you
can not recomend this game due to the lack of attention to the cheaters and team killings  caugh ASAINS caugh game still lags at the begging of matches most the time and i dont feal the creaters actually care about the people that play the gameits become a money grab i think i have friends on xbox whom 35 have refunded it game of the yearNO game of the end of the yearmaybegame was better when it was early access when people i know actually wanted to play
Nothing you havent read many times before Fix the Chinese flooding our servers and crack down on the aimbotting
this game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Korean poeple cant LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing code it crashes every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing time
Do not buy this game until region lock is implemented it has ruined the game completely Chinese players flood the NA servers and do either one of two things  outright hack or have such high pings you ll die to random BS In early access I was able to solo queue into a squad game by myself and have 3 english speaking teammates Queue solo in 10 3 chinese teammates 90  of the time  I can put up with bugs I can put up with terrible tick rate I can put up with a dev not being good at communication but I refuse to play a game where 5  of the total playerbase has been banned for hacking which would indicate roughly 10 15  of the playerbase is actually doing it Anticheat doesn t work and the developers clearly aren t acting on reports since they ve made their money and the game is  released  There are numerous reports online of cheaters who have been reported and not banned weeks later with things like a 255 KD ratio which is ABSURD I have hundreds of hours in FPS and multiplayer games I m familiar with what hacking looks like Search the web for  pubg hacks  and look at all the people complaining What you won t find is very little on the PUBG official forums about this topic because the mods are actively scrubbing the forumsEDIT  After some additional research it appears the issues of cheating are more prevalent on third person servers as opposed to first person While I find this odd it is worth it to note if you play first person exclusively this may be less of an issue
This game is awesome I used to play a lot But since the hack issue became out of control i haven t play much Its an absolute joke I joined 3 matches yesterday and i ve been killed by a chinese hacker in all of them so i went to watch Netflix instead Please find a way to fix it so everyone can play and have fun like it should be
Nice game like it
This is definitely my go to battle royale game the game feels consistant and allows you to understand whats going on pretty quickly the PvP is realistic and the controls are amazingI would recommend this game to anyone looking to buy it
It s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Had patience with the developer especially after promising a smaller map that I hoped would be better optimised Contrarily to my expectations they now published an even LARGER map As it is even one match can drag on forever  a youtuberstreamer made top 10 while leaving the game on autorun and playing hearthstone splitscreen However this applies only to those that have the good fortune of making it into a game In my case the game loads  black loading screen disappears and starts rendering the world only after I enter a game warmup finished and plane halfway across the map People having installed the game on an SSD said it works better for them Well if a game requires an SSD in order to be playable that should be clear indication of the incompetence of the developer If you still have any intention of buying this game at least make sure you have one or two friends to bring along At the very least it s a better experience with some friends by your side
I m playing it gram gram is playing it half of every other game s community is playing it you should be playing it Gives me anxiety Dope game
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is  a WONDERFUL game  I have to say that I loved it the day that it came out  its really astonishing So what I liked about this game  PEOPLE THAT ARE RACISTS  ALL THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BUGS IN THIS GAME  THERE IS EVEN A CAR NAMED BUGGY GUESS WHY    THERE ARE BUGS EVERYWHEREGenerally it was a nice game and I had a lot of fun  but LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  BUGS AND RACISTSDo not forget EVERYONE GOES TO SCHOOL  GO THERE TO LOVE LOVE LOVE  THEM ALL  DONT BE A CHICKEN  NUGGET
I ve only played a few hours on PUBG but this game is all around addicting It is very similar to Fortnite and other Battle Royale games out there but it s more realistic One downside is that it is pretty dang hard to run Any average PC probably wouldn t be able to run it but if you are not sure go to wwwsystemrequirementslabcom and search  PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS Rating  810
very good game  i like so much
epic game
Game is good But as long as there are chinesekorean cheaters playing EU i wont play anymore Battleeye is a joke Video recording to identify cheaters is a joke Reporting to central review is a joke as video dun work there is nothin to send This is a waste of money if you dun wanna get cheated
Best game on the steam market
hunger games without the hunger
fookin chinese
The game concept is fantastic love the idea butThe lags on the servers are so frusturating Game is still in beta still has a lot of problems and the  full release  was just a marketing thing For now i can t fully recommend this game I want the developers notice this problem and start working on it
Holy update This game is now amazing
I like the game and never came across a cheater but only once i would give this game a 8710 rating
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  PELI
   b
Jean Claude Alberts Would realy like this game Pure Non salt chinese people play this
It s a decent game especially for me coming from console The game can be a bit buggy at times the enjoyment with friends makes up for it The gun play was strange to get use to but it s quite decent It can be frustrating at times if you die in some weird way though But other than that it s good game
People can talk alot of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about this game but let me tell you how f     g fun it is This game is amazing Of course there are downsides to this game but majority are super minorPROS Super competitiveAlot of fun and intense momentsGreat with friendsCONS Doesn t have region lock allowing hackers internationally to join any serverA fair amount of lag issues
This is a great Battle Royale game probably the best It is addicting smart playing is greatly beneficial most of the times strategies for surviving are varied according to the gear and circumstances you find yourself into BUT the optimization is horrendous I find that barely being able to play with minimal resoultion and lowest possible settings on a i5 with 8gb of RAM and a very bad graphics card is not normal for the size of the world and the quality of the graphicsI realy hope an optimization update will come up cause for now the game is not really playable for me if heavy shooting or close quarters is involved I love it but it needs to run easier
game is very unstable and need a very good pc spec to play it without stuttering
after recent updates the app keep effing crashing on my windows 10
It s not bad and it is not poorly optimized I don t know what people are going through in this game
lit game
This game is indeed the best shooter of 2017 I even consider it the best shooter Its large maps and its citys make the game a true adventure for everyone who is able to survive the drop and loot phase Its graphics are absolutely gorgeous especially if you consider that its the first game ever released by the PUBG Corp Btw F  Fortnite
I tried the game for a couple of hours and did not find it fun I was not affected by any lag or bug issues and I am running an AMD setupI thought the game had a faster pace to it It doesn t But you do run a lotGuess for people who enjoy hidding and waiting for pray this is the right game
the game is a broken mess full of bugs and the people you fight against ruin the possibility of fun i want my money back but i didn t know if you have more than 2 hour in a game then no refund for you
Do not buy this game until they region lock Chinese hackers every other game
fixed game by the way verify after every match by the way
After 400 hours play time and 101 WWCD i love it  
Since the last update the game is not lauching anymore
Earned my money back just by playing
Very good game a lot of fun
I don t know why to seal my account Is your blue hole company so capable  Does the person who really use the outside don t go to the seal do they have a good technique and even eat two chickens to cheat  I hope to give me an explanation ID fadedfor mailbox 2925303830qqcom
99  cheaters are from China Chinese cheaters are on every sever This game is ruined 99 
Trump approves

Had fun with this game until hackers started to swarm every game If I paid for a game I expect it to be dealt quickly Do whatever you can to stop it besides just trying to patch because that obviously doesnt work
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game performance is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   full of cheaters  GG WP 1 SHOT HEADSHOT 
It has a lot of potential but some glaring issues have to be fixed before I can personally recommend it
First match of the day  LOADING SIMULATOR
This is honestly one of the most pathetic games of all time which is a complete shame since it came 90  close to being one of the BEST ever This game is very fun and addicting but the absolutly atrocious development makes it basically unplayable Either the developers are beyond incompetent or the management is pushing them in a way that is ruining the product Basic glitches and gameplay mechanics issues are completely ignored Instead they focus on more profitable things like skins and new maps Chinese hackers make third person ONE HUNDRED PERCENT UNPLAYABLE Literally every single game But I guess that makes me xenophobic  s   I keep playing this game in the hopes that it gets better and honestly because I have no other games to take its place In the meantime after countless hours in this game I feel a strong urge to ask Blueballs  How dare you make a game where 50  is the most amazing thing ever and the other 50  is the most garbage ever  Do you know how frustrating that is  F    you I absolutely hate this piece of garbage
Despite the vast array of emotions and anxiety this games gives me and other players the addiction has already set in Protip  Become the bush
Was a fun game but running around picking up loot for 20 minutes to get hipfiried to the head from 200m away in 80  of the maches isn t funLooks like theres more and more cheaters every day as every day I seem to encounter more of them Suggestion to devs remove deathcam an replays at least then you ll have doubt if it was a cheater or not who killed you Thus making the game not such so hard
A very fun well balanced game You aren t good at the first time you play this You really have to put some time and affort in learn certant spray pattern and bullet travel disctance It is way more fun to play this game with some of your mates But it is really GPU and CPU intensive My current build has an GTX 960 and i5 6400  Sometimes the textures won t load at the beginning of the game
How did u relase this game with the bugs that still exist  FIX YOUR GAME
Its a nice game its still a beta version but its good i highly recommend this to everyone
This is a great game but playing from south africa the latency makes it unplayable many people from south africa have reached out on the developers forums but they seam to be ignoring the sizable comunity in south africa also no lag compensation so tired of being shot around cornersEdit  still no lag compensation
very good game i enjoy it any second but the server s aren t that good
A true Curate s Egg of a gameOne the one hand it s fun to play against others who are not algorithm driven NPCs but who act unpredicatbly It gives the game legs It s also interesting to reflect on your defeat  and you will get defeated a lot and learn from your mistakes poor luck or just misjudgementButYou really have to go into this with your eyes open at the momentThere are a LOT of hackers Yes you can use your DeathCam to see who got you see if it was a hacker and report them if it was but you re still deadThe hackers are attracted by the marketplace for crates and until and unless that marketplace is removed this problem will continueThere are of course the famous glitches problems with optimisation ping differences etc but it s not as bad as some AAA games have released and they keep fixing itIMO there needs to be a mechanism to select maps as they play very differentlyAlso the Miramar map does not lend itself to thoughtful play Too little cover and without a scope you are deadPersonally I m going to stop playing for a while until these issues are fixed and this is after having sunk hundred of hours into the pre launch gameIf you can live with those caveats go for it but if not wait for them to fix the problems or look elsewhereNB  If the above get addressed I shall revisit this review and recommendation
This game is a valuable programmeI get the information from my friendsbut a large number of computers can not operate it fluentlySo if you want to playyou should better buy a superior computer
Overall  510Cons 1 Bad servers2 30 Euros for this is a lot3 Only two maps in the game is riddiculous4 Unability to chose a mapPros 1 Graphics2 Although there are only 2 maps they are great Shame there arent more   
Developer is a whiney LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Definitely recommend Super fun
Close the trading system I m sorry bad comment
PROS   Unique mostly well implemented concept  Broad maps with unpredictable twists and turns  Hair raising adreneline even when you aren t in compactCONS   The hitreg isn t perfect  The game can be a little laggy even with modifications to your computer This is problematic given how quickly you die even while wearing the best armor you can scavenge  Rendering issues Often parts of the world won t render even after you land and you have to spend several crucial seconds waiting for the details to come through before you can actually start looting LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   seconds your enemies might spend finding ammo to fill you with bulletsTLDRBuggy and sometimes a bit unfair but a fun adreneline pumping ride Buy at your own discretion
Highly recommend this gameyou can spend hundreds of hours on this game Few bugs and glitches need to be fixed though
We screamed fix your freaking game oh heres a few more guns no fix your game oh new map  NO FIX YOUR FREAKING GAMEok release it on xbox  FIX YOUR LAG RIDDEN HACKER PLAGUED PIECE OF CRAP MONEY GRAB OF A GAME ok 10 release uninstalled
way to many hackersway to many chinese with 500 ping killing youif you think this game looks fun i thought that to until i played it and now i wasted 37  CAD on a game thats only worth 20 max
This game was great until recently In the past week or so the hacking  cheating has gotten out of control in sqaud matches rendering the game basically pointless to play when you have no chance of winning in most matches The devs need to find a way to fix this before the game is ruined
AWESOME GAME
this game single handedly cured my cancer fixed my love life helped me get good grades and made my parents proud god is good  333
What A Nice Game
MISSING WARDROBE AND BATTLE POINTS NA
I love playing this game even with all its bugs its the best rush in any video game I have played  Pure strategy competition and a little bit of random luck   This game wasted away my summer fall and I was looking forward to it passing the time during the winter However the cheating has become so bad in this game since 10 Launch that I cannot recommend this game until it is under control   3 out of 5 games I am reporting someone for hacking with aimbots recoiless mods and being able to see me through walls   Wasting 20 30 minutes getting to the top 10 and being killed with hacks is so frustrating  Single duo and squad games all suffer from this problem   3 or 4 on 1 at the end of a match and you re team is dead because of some D bag with a fully auto recoiless M416 from 100 yards out  WOOTNot to mention I can barely meet any new players to invite to play our discord server because almost every random person you pair up with on the North America servers is from Asia and do not speak english or do not work as a teamThe addition of the  replay function  is awesome but it just helps me to verify that there are in fact so many cheating players that its not even worth my time to play anymore   This game is a 810 with no cheating and unlimited fun with friends   I miss those days but now everytime I log in to play I am filled with the feeling that I ve wasted my time and raised my blood pressure
Many hours of fun with friends had i ve been playing this well before it came out officially and there has been some issues surrounding the launch mainly rubberbanding serverside when initially spawning and some hackers Overall the best game of 2017 and previous to this I hated shooters Good job Devs  3
DO NOT BUY FULL OF HACKERS YOU WILL REGRET IT
couldn t run    refunded
GET RID OF THE CHEATERS Just download Fortnite it s free
this game is an great game  for skilled players but it takes time to get good
So many asian hackers in NA servers they need like a ping lock it s insane I ve been killed by people with names like 7537373 and they blaintly hacking it s extremely noticable PLAYER UNKNOWN if you see this please do something about it
TO  THE LEFT TO THE LEFT RIGHT RIGHT NW 270 NONO N 120 DOWN THE HILL DOWN THE HILL THERE THERE THEREvote   I suck at geography  10
Very fun thrilling and exciting everytime due to the RNG nature of the game This will probably be 1 of 2 games i play for awhile
Best 
very smelly stinky game 1010would say china 1 again
The realism of real life combat with battle royale makes PUBG fun for me  I can play like a turtle or I can play aggro IDC however i want to play that match I play it and see what happens
Got killed by a hacker tried to report him game crashed
Amazing game worth the 40 dollars
Remember DayZ mod  Same issues that were in that game are in this one It s even worse Useless antihacks Careless and incompetent developers Multiple hackers They dont ban by IP They state on their forums they only have 30 employees so it takes time They made a lot of money off the first sales Projected over 80 million I am pretty sure they can afford more staff They dont care and why should they  They made their money already In short Do not buy this game If you already purchased it please give a bad review and uninstall
the game s really goodfun to play with friends and they re really good about fixing issues and updating the gameonly issue is 1530 people are hacking so that s like 3 people per game you ll definitely run into hackers a lot especially if you get to end game   so good luck
It s been 788 hours I can write this review now I guessBeen a CS 13 15 16 Source CSGO player for over a decade I can say that I m quite used to this kind of gamesThe game was amazingly fun with all this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bugs and everything Over hundred hours of gameplay I ve seen only like a 3 or 4 speed hackers Hey You can t really blame the publisher for that the game was early access bugs and cheating is understandableThen 10 came nightmare beganIf you are an old school FPS player you d easily understand if someone is cheating or not all you need to do is checking the recoil of the player that you suspectMaybe it is gone mad after 10 maybe always was like that we are just realizing it now They implemented kill cam I can assure you that there is no other disappointment in the world that can match yours when your squad got killed by 1 man from miles away with his AK 47 with no scope attachment or whatsoever with no recoil at allThe list goes on and on I m sick of playing this game till the last circle and getting killed by some cheater there THAT DRIVES YOU MAD And believe me I ain t no guy who can get mad over a game easilyI don t expect them to remove all cheaters from this game I know that s not possible whatsoever But facing a cheater every single damn game is so annoyingAlso region lock became a must thanks to chinese people using hack on all serversTill they implement some sort of solid cheat protection and region lock I will not recommend this game Please check if there is any update after reading this in case I might forget to update this post if those are solved this game would be the best online game I ever had If there is no update after a while  you probably won t be reading this since the game will die as quickly as it rise
Bad game i don t know where is the half of our money to pay this game because to many lag in server
The minimum requirements are a lie
Very tense battle royal game with questionable physics It s not quite realistic but definitely not an arcade shooter Performance and lag have come a long way since Early Access The fact that these aren t 100  stable is frankly silly  this game is breaking records left and right so cost shouldn t be an issue Then there s just the complete lack of care for quality of life settings The difference in dB between gunshots and ambience is enough to damage your hearing perminantly especially if you re a headphones user A seperate slider for gunshots is not an optional improvement it s a necessary feature that isn t in the game Still there s enough depth here to pour dozens of hours in game If you don t mind lootbox progression RNG drops and limited  albeit BIG maps you might enjoy it
maza
1 Loots buildings and shacks2 Gets 11 kills3 Gets to top 54 Scopes in silenced Kar98 with 8x scope5 Gets one shot with a pistol in the back of the head 6 Finishes 2nd out of 100       1010 would get pistol whipped again OH I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS GAME I have to admit in the beginning of its run it had some optimization issues for sure but as far as I can tell now they have done a pretty great job at fixing those PUBG is a great game it has it all Every game is a new story and you are the character no round is the same whether its the players you run into the kills you get the buildings you go to the loot you get its AMAZING I used to play this game from 8pm to 9am without stopping because it was so extremely fun and rewarding it never seems to fail to pull you back in and have some more fun Would totally recommend
Game is pretty trash get anything else instead
it is a pretty fun game too bad the chinese have to ruin itif they introduce ping locks the game might be worth playing i suggest playing fortnite if you want a decent battle royale game until this game is fixed
Hours of endless fun in this game If you can not handle being killed within seconds of the game starting then look elsewhere Game still has a few bugs it needs to work out but for the most part it is a FANTASTIC game Better when played with friends
idk
Servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Hackers are everywhere If you like lag and getting killed by hackers feel free to play Would be a good game if they fixed the servers and the hacking issue
very good gamegreat graphics and shooting experience but the circles are too slow especially the first ones and it is so easy for campers and unskilled players to get win or even make it to top 10
good but too many bug
Great game that didnt disappoint whilst in early access however since the update the game rubberbands more than DayZ
This game needs optimization as soon as possible The game suffers from FPS stutter and drops I have an i7 8700k overclocked at 48 GHz and two EVGA 1080 FTW3 TIs in SLI and still having graphical issues I have the latest drivers in both CPU and GPU
Game used to be good now it s garbage If you want something better and cheaper just get Fortnite
This game is something that I ve been searching for my whole life An open word survival game in which you have to find props and weapons that can be used to eliminate other players The game itself is just so fun to play with your friends that it doesn t even need a story
The current state of cheaters is out of control With no real news from the developer or a real legitimate plan to curb the cheating other then calling us all xenophobes I can not recommend this game
The only battle royale game that is not LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  1010
I got this game after debating for awhile and I can say I am happy with my purchase Much different than COD or Battlefield in the way it is played One of the most suspensful games I have played in a long time
Been Lag like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  every time started game FPS Drop to 1 close range battle Suddenly Lag Freeze  Nice server PUBG Corporation will sure making u angry
I enjoy the game but there have been several occasions where I have just been running through a map and the game has closed with no prior warning
Do you want to run and hide only to be killed by lag or cheats  This is the game for you Introducing  running simulatorwhat was that the game 
worst anti cheat system ive ever expeirenced every single game has a hacker 100  will not recommend until they update the anti cheat or review player reports 
My game always crash please give me full refund
Just buy it  p u s s y
GOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
TOO MANY CHINESE CHEATING SCUMLove the game and despite it being fun to play both solo and with mates the chinese cheaters are out of control and now the newly introduced killcam clearly confirms this Nearly impossible to win once you reach top 10 as a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  asian cheater will kill you from a kilometer away without even zooming in and with automatic fire mode with every bullet connecting The DEVs really need to up their game and prevent cheating vermin Best to just ban China connections from entering any servers Aimbot and wall hacks are real and completely ruin the game for actual honest players
Mediumly LOVE LOVE LOVE  game lags a lot
Good game better  then the canncer  on csgo
They need to ping lock this game The game is amazing but it has so many cheaters Literally 910 games have 3 4 hackers using aimbots or ESP Bluehole refuses to listen to the community feedback about pinglockingregion locking the game Just wait for a company to make a clone of the game that can handle the cheaters better then this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  show of a company PING LOCKREGION LOCK and serverside anticheat system like BF1 uses Battle eye is to unreliable This is the worst game i ve ever encountered with the huge amount of hackers They re like roaches not exagerating at all Check the forums every 3rd post is a complaint about a hacker
this is the worst game ever the gameplay is glitchy and the maps are not finished and they keep coming with more glitchy content and they never fix any bugs fortnite is better worst game ever
Day Z gameplay except used only for combat just imagine how FUN that is
ez Chicken
ggwp
Still buggy as hell at 10
Definition of a perfect game The only thing i d like to see changed is less lag and more optimization
i love this game so much it hurts
Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters
I love the gameplay HOWEVERI cannot recommend this game because its infested with cheaters and Blue hole refuses to make any major changes to combat the problem REGION LOCK YOUR SERVERSAsian hackers have invaded the NA servers Its ridiculous
The game is so crowded of kids using cheats it is totally unplayable 8 of 10 games you will find a cheater if you survive long enought to meet him
I love this game but it needs polishing offCons  Game is very buggy despite it being releasedGame is very unoptimized despite it being releasedGame is very glitchy despite it being releasedServers are very laggy alot of the time and you rubberband for the first 30 secondsPros  Very fun Great ConceptOverall I do not reccomend this game until these cons are fixed
I overall really love this game it is a fun game to play with or without your friends it will always be fun to hop into a game with minimal hackers and get those chicken dinners if you re hesitant to buy this game for 3699 trust me and the player base it is mega worth the investment
I am v addicted
Really ffs    A company that gained such a reputation should at least tell about decisions like that IN ADVANCE SO THAT NOBODY GETS THEIR MONEY FREEZED ON THESE  ENEMY  THIRD PARTY WEBSITES CMON RLY SO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MOST CHEATERS CHEAT BECAUSE OF EARNING BP AND THEN MONETIZED DESPITE THE CHANCE OF GETTING BANNEDLETS CONSIDER CSGO WHERE THERE IS NO WAY TO BENEFIT SO HOW RE THERE ANY CHEATERS STILL  Next level of stupidity would be removing the opportunity of earning bp so that this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game has its online reduced 20 times
CHINA 1 What the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is wrong with this game now    2 weeks ago it was fun now I want my money back from the dumbass developers who sold me a good game then seamlessly turned it to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This is a good game if you have friends to play with and have nothing else to do
R E G I O N  L O C KTHE AMOUNT OF CHINESE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HACKERS PLAGUING US SERVERS IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Haven t played a single game where I didn t get massacred by someone from LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing china Lock the goddamn regions so we dont have to deal with this crap
Great Game however rampant cheating is ruining it
good game but people are very toxic sometimes
I got banned for no reasons wtf 
the biggest learning curve in this game is learning how to speak chinese
Developers had quickly fixed an issue tons of players were complaining about910 gl finding a vehicle
Fix the god damn lag
Far too many hackers and bugs Complete garbage
this game is vei faqn fun
This game s engine is pretty abysmal Everything else about the game is absolutely amazing
I built my computer just to play this game And to be completely honest this game has gone to hell There are people hacking in almost every lobby the report system seems to not work and there are people from different country s in the wrong lobby They have screwed this game up very badly since it s full release and I know tons of people have swore this game off bc the developers don t seem to care anymore and don t fix issues I remember when this game was enjoyable to play and we would play it for hours and hours at a time daily There are very very few big name streamers that will even play this game now It s not fun to play in your correct lobby and be killed by someone hacking in the game from a different country Reporting cheating seems to do nothing bc there is no repercutions bc all they will do is buy the game again and do it all over again If the devs don t do something quick then this game will die just as fast as it grew
i just dont understand how a trash game like this can be so populari ve refunded this
Lit just make sure that ur pc doesn t blow LOVE LOVE LOVE  or ur gonna be watching a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing slideshow because of how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the fps will be
Some people say that theres a lot of hackers and bugs and all I havent had that much bugs since starting in April and people are just exagerating about hackers i got to admit there are hackers  i have personaly never met hackers that shoot you through walls only a few aimbots and if you use your mind you can outsmart some hackers but unfortunately not everyone can use common sense Rounded up i have liked every minute of PUBG had some laughs and had some cries but the graphics are good and the gameplay is good aswell I would still go back and pay the 30 dollars up untill now Oh and btw if your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at the game and get shot by someone good dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing call him a hacker every single time
6910 a BR that has a best mechanics but the servers are awful
First let me say that I ve only got 15hrs in on this game I realize that immediately disqualifies my opinion for someSecondly let me say that I m not entirely sold on Last Man Standing or Battle Royale as is the popular tag now But it s definitely addictive and begs for that  just one more turn  That being said I think there s a very good game here It s simply buried in a lot of technical issues apparent hackers  I reported someone and frankly less than stellar graphics This game may bring your PC to it s knees but it s not because it s pretty It s very drap and reminds me of Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl  which frankly looked better The draw distance which is critically important with maps this large is kind of a joke The vehicle mechanics are wonky at best There is enough  flashing  going on with the graphics especially the interiors to make a Non epileptic have a seizure  This would all be acceptable if this were a mod to an existing game Or if this game were still in beta It doesn t seem acceptable that you have to pay for this mess even 30 is steep I d pay half that in it s current state   I may keep tabs on this one to see if it improves if the developer abandons it or worst of all if it becomes a DLC nightmare For now I have gotten a refund I will stick with Fortnite which is free early access and more polished than this game by a long shot
I used to love this game before the updte Everything reset and everything is so different and now i cant stand this game Mind u i have over 700 hours on this game before the update What a waste of a great potential game Huge dissapointment
Amazing game Many fun hours A few things need to be fixed but I love it still
preforms very poorly even though it looks like an early PS3 titleAlso the zone is just unfair and unbalanced in my opinionAnd the devs are seriously lazy because they only seem to release updates in big packages very rarely instead of putting out smaller ones when neededI think they should honestly give the game over to coolmathgamescom they would probably take better care of it than PUBG Corporation
interesting game I liked it ecpecially when playing with one or more friends Be aware that most of the gameplay is looting not shooting Has still potential to become much better since only a Beta version is playable for now so expect bugs  
If you have become attached to your hair and your eyeballs and your knuckles i would just avoid playing this trashy game The game itself is great  i m thumbing it down because of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  player base Who finds it fun sitting behind a rock or in a house or in a bathroom 90  of the time for 25 minutes just to get a few kills There is quite literally zero skill involved  find the best place to camp all game and you ve won If the devs added some kind of hit detection so you could actually see where the shots where being fired from  it would open the game up for people who like to run and gun and move on to the next house But right now  camping and sitting around trying to shoot people in the back is what this trashy game is all about
This game used to require a lot of cpu and graphics performance but since the official release update it has been running so smooth this game is really fun because you get to rome around where you want to go and try to fight off tough people to win 1st out of the other 99 people in the game highly reccomend this game 
Pubg  I love this game it is a multiplayersingle player even though I dont have a lot of hours on it the first time that I played I got 5th place
Alright concept ok gameplay for what it is but it also randomly mutes my mic which instantly wrecks any squad game i ve tried especially since there is no text chat as a backup
The game is buggy lags a lot and for some odd reason there are a lot of non european players in the EU server most of the times i played squad my teamates didn t speak english or any other european language But all these can be overlooked if you really like it the only problem that can t be is the cheaters There are cheaters in all shooter games make no mistake BUT because of the battle royale nature of this game   dying  game over   you ll have to start all over again looting until another cheaters kills you that ruins the game On top of that now the crates you buy  cosmetics require a real money key to unlock which is really pathetic and  greedy the game already has 3 million players clearly they don t need extra cash If you don t mind all these problems i mention then i hope you enjoy it but careful not to regret it as i did Remember that you can refund it if you play less than 2 hours
I love this game it is a fun experience The only problem is that I can t move for a short amount of time This happens randomly in game without prior warning
Not worth the money  The game is infested with cheaters  The gameplay itself is fine but the cheats ruin al the joy
Really good game Great community
i hate this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game  
Runs worse than a white midgit
Walking Simulator 2017   Current Date
good game much better with a group of mates
This game is an absolute travesty in terms of optimization for the amount of time it has been in alpha Especially considering the fact that this game has had so much support from seemingly everyone on steam the end product seems like a spit in the face It s the perfect example of a game gaining too much attraction before the developers could even finish it early access at its worst The people who bought this game  including me are the reason this game is the way it is we can sit here and complain about Bluehole all we want but the financial incentive isn t there for them As for the game it s a laggy poorly optimised and overhyped piece of garbage that only got this far because it s a battle royale game with shiny graphics nothing more Worst 40 I ve ever spent
this game is good like the graphics combat and variety of weapons
The game needs a hard ping limit   Tired of people from China joining with 200 ping who kill me after I m completely covered by a wall Parachutes need way more work12418 Edit  I just uninstalled the game so I won t be tempted to touch this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game until they actually fix the problems that we re telling them about
The game was fun until the banned me for no reason
Great and challenging game
a fun game when it works but at the moment the servers are just broken   
Game is very addicting
Best game Hopefuly  the rubberbanding and other bugs are fixed
yo if this game didnt just use the mexican map over and over and not use the orignal map this game would be so much better
I don t get the hype boring
i don t speak chineese
full of cheaters

This game is fun but lot of bug and horrible connectionAfter updated to the last version always getting error client not responding 357   D09C69Hope it fixed asap
I am disappointed with the quality of the game on releaseThere s many game breaking bugs
So far eh The game has potential but there is ZERO practice or tutorials so you will spend alot of time in real games just to get melted and have to start over again My main complaint is the fact that the servers are trash All the server complaints are true the game lags and I spent 30 on it two days ago just to be told  servers are busy try again later  NOT MY PROBLEM I just bought your game and if you can t support the player traffic sell to a company that can01142018 UpdateGame still has potential and can be fun but lag is still ONGOING The way you get killed doesn t even make sense on the kill cam Unfortunatetly still elementary when the players are in college
Only play for 3 hours and I got a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Perma Ban for no reason Good Job scam developer Im requesting my refund anyway I would nt recommend to buy too
servers are constantly down otherwise great game IF YOU CAN PLAY IT
Still better than Fortnite
It s essentially a simulator for shooting the chinese It s quite addictive The bugs and small quirks of the game can be frustratingly funny but the sensation of acquiring  The Chicken Dinner  makes up for every shortcoming The only reason I would say to NOT buy this game is if you have other games you would like to finish Once you get into this with friends it gets hard to play other games
Too many cheaters  Way too many Aim bot etc  I really enjoy this game however until this get fixed I ll pass
very  good game great gameplay
Would recommend if you have a dual 1080TI
Simple game Simple mechanics Unlimited replayability A different game everytime Hide or dominate
If you want to relieve anxiety from the stresses of everyday life and just settle down and unwind yourself onto a videogame putting behind a long days worth of work this is not the game to do that Everytime I play my heart literally hurts1010 Would suffer from stroke again
The game just feels horrible to play there are also alot of hackers i think the main part is the weapons they just feel horrible the recoil is just too dramatic and when shooting it just dont feel smooth or good to playalso hate the matchmaking its not skill based
I m 37been at these games since I was a liittle kidthis might just be the best game idea ever known to mankindomfg now make it compatable with VR DAMMIT
Bought game spent half an hour in matchmaking just trying to get one game turns out servers are offline due to one of many of blueholes f ck up s Refunded and got my money backWonderful game you ve got here Bluehole
I have played this game religiously the most out of all my games on steam It was a great game that should only be improved upon But somehow yall just keep doing the opposite and pushing updates that are trash and make the game worse and change everything about it when people thought the game was great before No one was complaining about weapons and you change everything for no reason other than yall wanted other guns used more You are losing more and more of your player base every day Quit pushing dumbass updates and fix the games problems and bugs that are already there Change the damn weapons back no one asked for that literally no one and y all just did it without any insight form your COMMUNITY Bluehole will be nitoriously remembered for a huge hit game that only got worse and continued to drop the ball Keep on this path and you ll be bankrupt before you know it bluehole
Great game that makes you keep wanting to do  just one more round  It hasn t found its feet yet with all the balance updates but I m hoping that will come in time
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing freeze all the time
I hate this game Too many cheaters and nobody does anything about it Complete b u l l s h i t
All these maps are single I am more like to play some other map For example like Japan Africa India Russiaand also i want to Players choose the mapThanks
less than 20 people left and feeling pretty good about the game so far turn to my left game crashes Doesn t give me an option to join back either but don t worry it s fully released now and  eSports ready  fix the garbage parts of this game like the crashing and the hackers from other regions and maybe I ll change my review status
A complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  from a technical point of view but still one of the best games I ve played at it s worst
i cant run this game wtf
My 1st Steam game purchase Not regretting buying it as its quite the best online game that I ve played so far
you spend 10 mins looting only to get shot from the back by xianlow15627
the worrist service and give me old map plz
very nice i sold my cow for this but is gud uh to be honest this sucks when you re like an absolute bloody loner and you re pretty much blind or basically deaf k
1010 would watch again IGN
OverviewAs many others have said this game was and can still occasionally be a lot of fun especially with friends Sadly the closer it came to launch and even worse now after is the amount of hackers A lot of games you will encounter the occasional hacker but this game it has become more expected to run into one Really takes out the fun of a game to make it to the top 5 10 people to have someone with no recoilauto aim kill your entire squad before you can even get a round off There are some things that need to be addressed before I would consider recommending this to anyoneProsFun with friendsFor the most part the game looks niceRolling over a van when making a slight turn at 5kmhDeflecting a shotgun blast using a panCan turn off global chatConsServers often busy or unable to connectHackers becoming more commonIssues from early access made their way into full releaseParts of new map can get you stuck in placeIssues with streamers getting people bannedGetting the same few common cosmetics over and over
Bluehole I am honestly quite curious who you have working on this game I rather rub my face with skateboard grip tape while I am continuiously getting kicked in the throat by angry midgets The amount of Chinese Hackers who have riddled this game with a cancer LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing a communist state really gets me down I hope one day you guys figure it out maybe try not to mess with the balistics of a weapon so much too why is the M4 trash now are you really going to send troops into a war with an UMP or an M4 cmon common sense I literally have to relearn how to use different weapons But thats something i can deal with Do you hate your community  Constantly not listening to how many people have begged for a server lock
it is very nice game  
Two words heart attack
I LOVE this game  But man the cheating  It s so bad  The servers really need to be regionally locked   Chinese players are really annoying and they love to cheat  It s not a racial thing it s a truth thing  They flood the servers  especially at night and it drives me crazy to be killed by one of these dudes with the username like  1484u89320kai  who are either cheating or just taking advantage of high pings  Utilizing the deathcam feature will bring witness to at least two cheated deaths in a 2 3 hours session  It s really unfortunate   I m not sure how to fix it either but now that it s 10 people aren t gonna stand for it much longer  I would say save your money tell bluehole to get it s stuff together and fix the anti cheat system then go buy another game  With all the money they ve made off this game there s no excuse
Laggy on very low Clunky as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Chinese hackers everywhere Makes you want to end your life Just get a game from a proper developer instead
I am like this game so much its better from the early accses verison this game is the best game of 2017 and i think he have a big future in 2018 this game just starting growing up i hope to see how bluehole team will change it and upgrade itGOOD LUCK FOR GETTING CHICKEN DINNER  i cannot get it yet      
NICE MY FAV GAME
At the moment the game is INFESTED with chinese hackers who take advantage of ping and desync and play on NA and EU servers ruining the game for everyone else The game still has optimization issues for example your FPS will drop dramatically inside buildings but will stay stable in open fields Also lag and desync is still very prevalent which is annoying The game still feels Early Access and still has a lot to improve on
buy bug get game free free hackers play with u
Too many chinese people on north american serversrefunded  
Simply wasn t ready to leave Early Access Hackers insane rubberbanding issues low tickrate servers huge numbers of bugs resulting in unwarranted deaths rendering issues and much more plague the game Its come a long way from alpha but it s still not ready to be called a finished game not close Can t recommend in its current state
it s amazing but the spawn earrpes you with  china number 1  and people putting on mans not hot
i really like this game its the best if you have a squad of 3 4 XD
 How to end your Marriage guide 2017 version 10 
Desync Lags Cheaters ENOUGH SAIDOnly hope is that this piece of trash dies fast and a GOOD publisher brings up a Battle Royale the playerbase deserves
Made my friend LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  him self 1110 Yes I seriously recomend this game and it is well worth it
drop down at school see 20 people get a pistol get killed by someone with an m416 repeat
BEST GAME SO FAR
too many hacks in this game
i dont recommend this game to people who think about buying this game cheating is still massive and really annoying in addition desynch lag and rubberbanding is not fixed at alltopic report a player  i did it twice in november no response at all customer service full failure and incompetentwhen i doubted a posting of someone who said he believes that there a no cheaters at all i got a penalty in the official pubg forum so critisicm is not allowed or tolerated but you have to accept terms of policy this is not how you handle your customers dont waste your money on this game
Arcade Battle Royal type game Everything is quite smooth mechanic wise Just has some issues with rubber bandingStriaghtforward rules and don t have to commit alot of time Matches last max 30 minutes
Why is this game so poor This really shouldn t be this bad at this stageYet another update and yet another period of inactivity because the game no longer loads and just sends error reports
Great game at its core Very addictive and funUnfortunately there really is a ton of cheaters At least one  but probably more in every game They can be killed so you can still win but the odds are reallllllly stacked against you Cheats range from being able to see players through walls to seeing all players on your map in real time plus auto aiming for perfect headshots with any gun when the player is in the cross hair There may be god mode cheats too I don t know I ve shot guys a ton and they turn around and one shot me But since all the players are on the other side of the world lag is a real problemSo far all the cheaters  I ve found are players from China playing in the NA servers though I m sure there are NA cheaters too It s just rare to find NA players at all in the NA servers since its 90  Chinese players So unless you speak Chinese don t expect to join public squad games as a single and talk to anyone  You d think with the 20 million players they boast they could afford to write some code to use geo location to force players on their local servers and ban known proxies Can t stop cheating 100  but it would sure cut down on the cheaters in the non chinese servers Til they fix that expect to lose 9999999999  of the time Its a shame because the game mechanics and graphics are nice People used to strive for wins now people just go for quick kills to get better stats since they know they ll be cheat killed before the endThey added a death camso you can at least see how you were killed and see if it was legit Unfortunatley it seems the latest cheat makes the players name unknown So even in the death cam you can t see who the player was that killed you Maybe the report button works still who knows  You can play a full game without running into a cheater pretty often well at least you could but I just played 4 games in a row with cheaters one was in my squad I team killed him    cheaters Wouldn t recommend this game at the moment til they at least fix the server location stuff
Do I love this game yes Is it still buggy as hell after being out for a long time yes Do I recommend you buy it now  Not really You will love the game more if you wait for the edges to be smoothed out and for the latency issues to be fixedI probably will carry on playing this game even with the issues as it s an awesome game to play with mates but if you have the pacience wait for it to get better and you will love it Solo or with a group Amazing potential but lazy developers
Love the game and playstyle   hate the large amount of hackers and people showing up as unknown  120 games are enjoyable because of thisIt s good to see the dev team has added the deathcam aspect but it just shows how many people are blatantly using walls
Developers are som cheap mofos for not getting proper servers Unable to play game because it s too busy
There is this type of survival games that catches up the gaming community real fast The initial one would be Bohemia s DayZ which was a clusterLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with its Early Access builds and still is Later came a lot more similar concept games like H1Z1 Survival ARK etcEveryone of them stresses on survival open world and most importantly Early Access Because of EA and DayZ s clusterLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I never intend to buy a game on EA I ve known this game being popular for awhile and the stats of it is staggering With millions of active players every single day and how it peaks the Steam active players leaderboard This game is definitely a hit thinking that Bluehole might as well just have made hundreds of millions dollars and the sales is still growing along the release of 10HOWEVER it s a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fake official release The game is still poisoned with tons of problems inside and overall it s still a very poorly optimized gameWhen I joined the game with my friends who kind of peer pressured me to play it I asked them what s so hyped up about this game  I played DayZ before with a hundred hours in it I know games like this without optimization is a complete fk upThe idea of PUBG is taken from Battle Royale An interesting Japanese movie made in early 2000s depicting a group of students battling each other to death so the winner can escape the set arena The game is pretty much the same first you got 100 people skydiving from all over the sky and into a big ass map And these suckers combat each other to death all over the place A time circle will display on the map and limit players  play area whoever outside the circle would drop his health constantly and drops faster each time the circle reduces A typical Battle Royale playmodeWhat are the problems with this game  A ton Optimization this game is so poorly optimized  HD7950 I have to set everything low or very low to keep the fps above 30 And everytime I got hit no matter how huge the damage is my screen would stutter to hell and unable to react at all Basically die instantly if someone else spots you first and you can t react because it s too laggy and stutterySmall pickles like the animation is so fked you have to position straight 90 degree to a window to vault over  the server gets laggy occasionally  terrain still needs much more polish  you don t have a tutorial to start or a training room to test out features it s a basic feature for every 3A game out there  apparently the sound module is still under development  control is weird on this matter Battlefield s control is much better than this DayZ ish control DayZ itself is pretty fked upHow on earth can you call this an official release  For now the only successful EA game into a nice and fluid experience that I ve seen is ARK That game is praised I don t get it Bluehole has all the money out there to improve the game and yet it s still a very LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  experience with almost nothing different from EA builds Many problems from EA persist to the official release Sometimes I really wonder why are people so obsessed about this game I think even if you implement a Battle Royale mod in GTA V that game would be far better than this one Because the open world element in GTA V is far more polished and optimized than this one here and that s basically the reason why Bluehole is an EA studioThe hype of Overwatch last year has already died down This game doesn t seem too much of a hype to me its essential mechanism is rich and that s what makes most  old  games triumph for a long timeBut in regard to how today s globalization works trends and hypes just swoop through continents with haste I think people just more or less love to jump into some same sht together and enjoy for some timeEither way I don t recommend buying this game it s pointless My BP today after probably a week from purchase is still NA And that is ridiculous people say that the only way to solve this problem is to buy another copy WTF  
Love this game So fk feels
ill be on point the game itself is good but the server is LOVE LOVE LOVE  Can t play cuz their are reasons that I can t play like servers are to busy server is too loaded damn please expand it
Overloaded servers poor connection terrible gameplayoverall an unpleasant experience Give me my money back
FIX THE GAME
help me get chicken dinners
This game has many fun atibites that creat a fun exciting adventure I loved to play this game untill they make me spend money to open crates when they used to be free If you want to play and have fun then you have to spend more than 30 bucks The cost of the keys to open the crates is now 250 The company is now only about money The amount of Chineese hackers in the game is astonishing I ll die from someone shoting one bullet from an incredible distance and from an angle that is totally unplosible I can t under good concance recomend this game to anyone untill the company decides to better their corprate greed and bans the hackers and gets rid of the stupid 250  DON T BUY
If this is your first time playing a battle royal game don t think this is all their is to the genre PUBG is a game I feel like everyone just gets because everyone has it I ve won a couple games while playing with my friends and I ve had a couple fun or funny moments However if you plan on playing this game to win just know the most viable stratedgy is just to find a safe place to wait around go to somewhere else and wait around some more The map is massive so even though there is a hundred people waiting to kill you it s not as action packed as you might think Encounters with other players felt too few and far out for me to consider this game entertaining Maybe that s just because I tried to win so I wasn t constantly throwing myself in harm s way enough to have a good time but I don t feel like you should have to play with a certain ruleset in mind to have fun So if you re coming to win expect to be bored and if you aren t then expect to be bored a lot of the time but still have a couple fun moments
Very nice but targeting without any sight is hard cuz the targeting dots are barely visible if I shot without any sight in ar and sr
Don t buy this game plain and simple The main reason I hate this game is because of the net code along with rampant cheaters Getting shot around corners getting shot when your not even on the other players screen and sometimes you get a glorious cheater who takes 11 SKS shots to the body and just looks at you with a smile This game in its current state is not worth a single penny It is also poorly optimized even with a beast of a PC rubber banding and massive frame drops are a regular occurance People from the Asia servers also love to join NA for a nice ping abuse advantage Game just isnt fun for me so many glaring issues that the devs seem to be ignoring This is an early access Alpah despite the 10 realse In my opinion its a real shame if this is the new stardard for  finished  games Rampant cheating the worst net code I have ever ecperienced in an FPS game BF titles included and complete lack of region locking making it impossible to have teammates that speak your language Every fire fight feels like a laggy mess of bullets not going where you aim getting shot while completely around corners and watching kill cams only to see the guy who killed you lock onto your head through a wall 010 would refund if I coud
Battlegrounds is one of the greater games Ive bought recently It really takes in the survival aspect and the first or third person shooter aspect Its a smooth game too unlike most games of its kind where they are choppy and glitchyThe game gets your blood pumping and is intence pretty great graphics beautiful guns in the way of looks and operationAll together a great game to play by yourself or with friends
Good Game Recomended
like it a lot
dont buy this game its all about who has betther cheat  
I would love to reccomend this game to my friends It has HUGE potential and it WOULD be an amazing game but CHEATERS Thank you for allowing me to watch the death cams It s a great addition as it allows me to report genuine cheaters which are ridiculously blatant and 99  of the time ASIAN LOCK THE SERVERS TO REGION ASAP Out of my last 5 games played I have been killed by a HACKING CHEATING ASIAN SPEAKING JERKFACE in 4 of them I m walking away from this game for a while It needs to be fixed
sooooooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddddddddddd
Very good game My favorite part of the game was when I won a delicious chicken dinner
Stupid game get stuck in mutiple places Bugs everywhere and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  shifting and lagging  Pls use some money to get a better server
I d refund this if I could  
Every new game you decide in seconds which tactic youll play  The Open World looks beutiful and the cities and some spots are very interstingWhen you are fighting its fun and everything works good butYou cant choose the map and the start of each round is leagging but thatll be fixed in the coming weeks i think so and also i hope so  DNow you can choose the Map and its not legging anymore
I cracked under pressure and got it Sure there s a crapload of bugs but it s enjoyable
This game is totally not worth the money It should be a free to play game only because of the many glitches the extreme lag at the beginning of every round and of course the lack of support This game is like DayZ You don t know for certain if it is even going to work or if it is going to backstab you and destroy your entire day I would not recomend this game to anybody At least not for the price of 30
this game is one big fail Lot of lags kills trough the walls cheaters and many server issues horrible release
has it s fair share of glitches and bugs but all and all good game 810
This game is very fun but you need to be good at shooter games and have a good computer for this game Many people think that there are hackers everywhere but they get rid of them really well
I don t like itYou have to be really good at FPS games to win And maybe some people feel accomplished finishing in the top 10 but I can t Sometimes you die within the first few minutes and then you have to go throught the whole selection screen again and then the pointless pre flight area where everybody is just grabbing guns that will not help them at all 5 10 mins later you are back in the game just to maybe die again soonNot worth my time especially having some polish kid yelling profanities in my ear
Makes H1Z1 look autistic Definately recommendGun Physics are amazingGraphics quality is amazingOverall great game
Im really enjoying this game most of the time and i dont think it deserve that much hate as it is getting right now because soon there will be really good additions coming soon looking forward to it  
biggest garbage ive ever played
Ever since the 10 release my game wont open I have spent hours trying different troubleshooting steps I m not going to waste more of my time listing everything I did but I reinstalled the game twice tried opening from different locations verified the games files and blah blah blah it still wont open My PC is a 8 month old PC with a i7 and a Gtx1080ti and 1tb SSD so it s not my system At this point im tired of trying to get it to work and I want my money back
Almost 400hrs and recently every game is just hackers hackers hackers
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lag in the beginning of every game
This game really need to balance the performance for the poor pc because the fps is very low even if the graphics is very low too
Almost 600k stupidly long reviews people dont have time to readSummary Game is extremely funGame is even more fun with friendsIt can have extremely bad lag but everyone has the same lagLearn to take it easy and enjoy the game instead expecting to win each game and you will enjoy it a 100x moreDoes it have its problems  Yes but I have had for more play time   fun on this  problem game  than any full release game in the past 3 years
I find this game absolutely amazing for anyone who likes FPS and competitive play I have never had issues with cheaters killing me and I am by no means a pro but once you feel yourself climbing that learning curve it just gets more and more exciting Had issues with server connections during beta but haven t since the initial 10 release
A very fun game but the problem arises from the bugs in this game The developer released a version 10 after early access which did not show any promising fixes for the lag and bugs in between the game So it s not worth putting in the full money on this game Wait for the bugs to be fixed and buy it during steam sale whenn the price is low
This is not a bad game it s really not Just lacking in charm If you are okay with a gritty realistic game with average graphics but in depth controls then this game is for you But me personally  I d just download Fortnite It s free has more simplified controls and has a unique graphical style I m not trying to trash on this game or say that it s not worth the money I m just saying that you should consider both options And the right option for me is Fortnite
First of all im a newcomer in this game or rather type of game But I d already have to reccomend it it is a solid game but there are a couple things to note before playing it1  There are alot of hackers Alot It gets really annoying when you get shot by a bullet that was aimed 5 feet behind you but you can report players It s also kind of mediocre that there are 3 million active players and that 15 Million players have already been banned  Seriously read this article  http storesteampoweredcomnewsexternalpostpcgamer22848799495361194752 There are alot of Asian players and i haven t been in an American server yet without any Asian players3 Running around There is alot of running Whether it be to a house or highway running away from bombs  enemies or just trying to get back inside the boundaries4 Play this game with a friend It s pretty stale if you play it alone5 You re gonna get shot alot And if you re new to this style of FFA you re gonna get shot from people you couldn t see in the distanceThis game is fun though If you like games such as H1Z1 or Fortnight s battle royal its pretty much the exact same thing This was useed to inform you guys if you buy this game which i reccomend these are things you need to look forward to
Almost 500 hours in and finally 10 has arrived so has my first review This is the best multiplayer arena type game I have ever played As an Arma 2 and 3  veteran   by my own standards almost 1k hours combined I am familiar with the mechanics and there was little to no learning curb If you are a newbie to the genre or to the mechanics well all I can say is this is NOT call of duty Play this game Earn your dinners and the feeling of winning a match is not comparible to any other game Adrenaline pumping nerve racking and panic inducing fun BUT     BUYER BEWARE    THIS GAME IS PLAGUED WITH CHEATERSIt is getting really bad I dont blame the devs at all on this one The dev s are making continuous progress in fixing and optimizing this game They have done A LOT in a very short time frame The cheaters are everywhere litterally They have hacks where they can see your name and health from anywhere on the map your location shows on their minimap and the F       aimbots are very real Dev s need to region lock servers and double down efforts on anti cheating because it is litterally ruining a very very good game
Super game and only getting better
It s okey
Devs whipping and a good few thrusts from Behind
Great game Never seen hacker
CheatersAnd some more cheatersWith the release of 10 you can easily see how cheaters auto lock your head and kill you  and your teammates
Kinda nice game but  it has some bugs and it s not a big problem because half of them are fixed in the last patchSo there is my opinion about the gameGameplay  810Graphics  910Controls  1010Vehicle controls  710Shooting  910My overal rate to PUBG is  8610
askjdnajksndkjasndnkjasdnajs ooh eeh ooh ah ah ching chang wolla wolla bing bang
Jees
It very gud i love to sucky sucky LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ie LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ie REMEMBER CHINA NUMBA JUAN
Well after dealing with massive number of hackers I also have to deal with frequent game freezing and crash with no reason Besides I guess devs just refuse to fix their in game voice system None of my friends can hear each other in game  D
Gets your heart beating
IT S a very good gameI think the gamevery awesome
This Game Has a very fun concept that I enjoy Alot Pretty much the only problem I have with this game is it need a bit more work as far as servers go and opimization but the optimization is not horrible on my gtx 1060 and i5 i get around 60fps on Ultra and foliage on very lowThese problems have notstoped the game from being fun but are still problems that should be fixed The game has been optimized but is not well optimized the game has bugs but is not covered in bugs The servers work but arent great the GAMEPLAY IS GREAT
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ADD FRIENDS IN THIS GAME FIX IT
As of December 28 2017 BattleEye has reportedly banned a total of 15 million players of the 24 million copies of PUBG sold Now that Player Unknown s Battle Grounds has left early access and released a new map and vaulting mechanics hopefully something can be done about the flood of hackers from ChinaHowever unlike other games such as Rust which bans and names the player in the chat there is no indication if this is true as the numbers are only communicated by BattleEye s twitter on occasionThe combination of incentivising winning the game by awarding credits that can be used to purchase crates and then allowing those crates to be sold on the steam marketplace has turned this game predominantly into a Chinese gold farm I have had occasional hard crashes of the game without an error warning heavy lagging due to server load vehicle colisions  into minor changes of terrain height  bridge abutments and visibly minute changes in terrain grade and experiencedwitness the player model getting trapped next to objects  one witnessed today resulting in the death of a team mate by  falling damage  from a 4 foot high crate These are just the game breaking bugs but there are plenty of minor bugsPUBG Corporation have also confirmed that they will also be adding microtransactions for lootboxes in the future so players can gamble their real world money away for digital cosmetics
Its a fun game but too many bugs Especially the Loading screen bug at the start of the game
I like to hide in a bathtub and pretend I m a killer walrus
Stayed buggy for too long Too many hackers Then they decided to release Xbox full version before getting PC out of beta Also hard fps drops Uninstalled do not recommend
Good Game Worth Buying
If you need a benchmark for your pc look no further
Had a Pump shotgun with a choke Standing 10 feet away from the target I shoot him square in the upper body It doesn t knock him out Why nerf the shotgun so much you can get a kill from 10 feet with a choke on the shotgun Please buff the shotgun again Also every other game played has a hacker killing everyone Not a really good player but instead an actual hacker Take out the hackers They re really ruining the game for a lot of people After 840 hours of playing more than 400 of those hours involved hacks in game Kind of getting tired of the crap bluehole is letting happen
How about a sale for the winter sale so I can buy for some more peeps for Xmas 
Good game just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  crashes and rubberbands with unloaded textures in the beginning of matches   
unplayable garbage
what game 
this game made me wanna turn gay and hang myself
I don t for the life of me understand the hype around this game The idea is ok I guess the execution is horrible It looks like a PS1 game and yet still runs at less than 60 frames on a rig that runs BF1 on ultra locked at 60 fps The physics suck and it wantys you to spend more money at every turn Good for them for selling so many copies but I wont be spending any more time on it
good game but full of bugs
Great game love it just need a server in ZA
play this with friends best game of 2017 ez
Very good game and addictive but it needs optimization like every other game which got released Please people understand that its new game and its not totally ready yetI would recommend this game
BECAUSE I SAY NO
BAD LAGGING GAME
amazing game Can be addicting LOL xD Very good game recomend
Optimization is good now No fps drop on my pc and i can play smooth on medium high settings
This is a freaking nice game
Game should have never been released as a full release An embarrassing attempt at a money grab Don t bother buying it until Greene fixes his LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and fixes this game Lag for days
really awesome game 
I have to change my review because of the stupid devs that made this game The devs are focusing on the future and not focusing on the mass amount of bugs One of those bugs being their anti cheat My friend Cennisen literally did not have for 3 days and got game banned for no reason No email was sent nothing This LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  anti cheat has gotten other people banned and made people refund because of their bans and also optimization A final reason is the optimization This game says a majority of pcs can handle this game but you need to have a beefed up pc to play at 60fps This game was rushed out of early access did not fix anything but added more broken LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to the game Bluehole please listen to the people and fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is the best considering the gameplay but trash when you consider the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t optimisation and after the 10 update the game just dosent open the lobby overall i think you better try Fortnite much better experience over there
The game has become crap I cant match up with any teams that speak English and work together any more Fix their servers so they will stay off of the NA and lagging it up with their families talking in the background
Excellent game I love to play this game with friendsReally easy going and fun
99
NEW update so BADlagLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  jumpno LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing loot like beforeso many bugs
They went to version 10 but servers still have too much lag I get dc d in middle of a game I m shooting at a person and my bullets are hitting nothing even tho my aim is directly on that person All in all a good game but some stuff to work on regarding lag and quality of their serversUpdate Still playing and still getting crappy lag  dying lots to lag and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers
Great idea of game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  developmentfor that money what they make this game need be that much good to can play next 10 15 yrs it but unfortunately they just want money  and dont give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for players Just bcz of it i give bad ratingDevelopemnt need know that PLAYERS ARE ALLWAYS ON FIRST PLACE THEN YOUR POCKETS
A bit laggy and drops FPS a lot of times Polishing the game and optimising for performance is necessary but otherwise it s a great game
Very well optimzed Unreal Engine p
Hate it so hard to get one kill wasted so much time playing it Not for everyone and definatly not for me No tutorial does not work well with 3 monitors Pwople cheat by using low grapics settings to be able to see other players from a distance Item pickups is buggy and costs me from surviving in a round Admins are not prompt with players that cheat
this game is lit lmao
This game has a future 
If you don t always have a full squad of people you know and you don t speak Chinese then don t bother If you have a time machine go back 6 months and play this game then when the randoms actually spoke the language that corresponds to the server they re playing on and where you don t get racist slurs thrown at you
The game s good but since it published i can t play because of the hacksthe devs must absolutely take anti hack measurs if they want their game to move on
this game was epic but the new update and the new map i dont like it at all
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing horrible servers and connection and all that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in this game
PUBG NAMBAH WAN
I would have rather this game been published by Hello Games than these wads This game is like a drug but controlled by a corrupt government to keep the people ignorant and repressed If you aren t already addicted I beg you to never buy this game You will only be dissapointed by the developers lack concern for those buying their caviar If I could get a refund with my 800 hours I would Just wait until the next studio does this game better It s a fad I don t see this making it past the Darwin Project Islands of Nyne Hunt Showdown or EFT
No available servers       Constantly
The game cant be THAT bad i said to myself All that bad stuff cant be true Install game servers are full for about 45 minutes
this gameeeeeeeeeeee have a lot  cheating
Queued into an NA server squad game Got placed into a squad with three chinese men They kept knocking me down and demanding that I say  China Numba One  Upon my refusal to do so they would revive me only to knock me down again This continued until the playzone was restricted to the point that I died immediately after being downed Besides that it s been pretty good
O mizerie
this game is an unpotimized pos dont waist your money on it they only released into 10 because they made a promise to get it out befor 2018 even now as i type i cant connect to the servers because they are too busy you would think after months of testing and millions of testers they could have atleast worked out their servers before launching the game into 10 i dont normally take the time to write a review about a game that is god awful in so many aspects but calling your game a finished product when it clearly isnt its just lying dont get it
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game The servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Everything is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in this game DON T BUY THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ASS GAME
I spent good money on this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game I spend 25 dollars and update it and this is what I get  BUSY SERVERS To heck with all of this To heck with your family To heck with your friends All in all 710
Great game if you speak chinese                                    
i wish that you can choose which map to play i am getting bored of the new map
games sucks i got perm banned for nothing i havnt played it for about 2 months the one time i want to im perm banned LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you ubisoft go sucka LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE es
goks
Love this game but ever since 10 I cant even launch the danm thing
Awesome game to get a couple of the boys on and crack a few cold ones and collect souls
I ve been playing since early september The game was amazing everything was so crisp and cleanIt was looking good for PUBG everyone was happy and pleased with this gameAnd then the release of miramar came aboutFog was remvoed from the gameRain was removedCases were not free anymoreMore hackersNew fontFirst person was removed from the planeNew spawn locations and no guns on the starting islandUseless vanity updatesThe game has really changed in a bad wayBut saying that the game is still great the new map  Sanhok is amazing The rain and fog are coming back and many other things are comingBut it is disapointing what they have done
Lag and hackers are making the game very close to being unplayable and please do something about the got damn chinese
I have nearly 115 hours and it s time to make a reviewPUBG to me is like that perfect balance between an ARMA game and a game like H1Z1 It has that tactical and survival part from ARMA then spiced a little up with some stuff from games like H1Z1 ARMA II is by far one of my favourite games to date so being able to play a game like PUBG that has some of the same aspects as ARMA is amazingI can nothing but recommed this game but then again at this point I think we all have it I even own 2 copies of course the game has it s flaws like any game doesThe thrill and the overall experience of being top 10 makes this game so unique feeling your heart pumping faster and faster as people get picked of one by one is one of the greatest feelings in the world and then the storm calms down when you finally get that sweet marinated chicken dinnerMe and many of my friends cannot wait to see what devs and future modders have in store for us I m mostly hoping for an survival mode or do i dare say an DayZ like mode  o Just buy it already  mDriveUnit
yes i do like running people over with cars
Even after release still full of bugs and errors
After 500hours of this game i have to make a reviewI will keep it simple It s laggy and it s trash but i will keep play it since i m a damn masoThanks
This game is a lot of fun i have won many games and me and my friend have only had a few bad times playing it However the game is very buggy for a full release game you need a mid spec to high end pc to get over 60 frames but you can run this on almost any desktop considering that the game is fairly optimized now Also many times me and my friends have gotten stuck resulting in death and a  feelsbadman  in our group chat If you enjoyed H1  that utter piece of garbage this game is for you NOTE  I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND THE FIRST PERSON ONLY MODES BECAUSE IT IS MORE FAIR IF YOU BUY THIS GAME TRY TO START WITH FIRST PERSON
This is a very fun game with graphics I wouldn t necessarily shameThe problems Hackers ping abusers lag in the early part of the rounds that dissipates as people die offI personally would prefer a more well handling movement system for the character  It s too sluggising sidestepping starting moving and stopping  It s like this game is more like GTA 5 instead of Rainbow 6 siege in gameplay fluidityI think it should take fewer hits to downkill someone they need to perfect the whole falling down a 45 degree slope killing you thing and make your vehicles less likely to roll at 05MPH and kill you when you exit  Automatically set the park brake or something geezThe game is very addicting but in general I woul not recommend it because it is not polished enough that I think it is ethical for them to have removed it from beta status  Therefore I want as many people as possible to not give them more money until they earn it
F       U         C           K        H1
Its a Fun Game
As an idea the game is great and when it actually runs fluid it could be considered greatBut it cannot be recommended in its current state with extremely laggy servers a severe hacker infestation and just plain instability all around
I want to know why I didn t use any hacker software and I didn t modify the game files but I was banned from the game I am a gamer from China and there are many Chinese players and I have the same situation If you can see this message please reply Thank you very much
poo
This Game so AWESOMEI LOVEEE THIS GAMEEE
Why is an arma mod being sold for 2699 
Laggy and getting worse and worse each update recently
it good it hard it fun
I can see the improvements keep it up
Easily my favorite game of all time Even though I hate it sometimes will always be my fav
that was a good game but it belong to the bule hole
This game is AMAZING My buddy and I just played it all night and streamed it on twitch BTW y all should check me out on twitch  ThuperDuperDude  Anyways the game is honestly super fun I can play it all day and all night if I could Trust me you will enjoy it if not get a refund
             
Retail patch ruined this game New map sucks new physics suck new visuals suck very close to just uninstalling
pretty decent I guess
why my game always crash after i want to start to searching the game 
so bad
Broken to hell dunno how you can call this a 10 game complete pile of overhyped garbage Borderline unplayable with the cancer tickrate mediocre gunplay LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  physics and insane lag This company should be ashamed Still win though  
I love this game but i think that they should let us choose what map we want and fix the lag I cant move when im trying to pick up a gun and kill an enemy fallen with me in the same town
Enjoyable
All round a fun game great to play alone or with clamours group of friends My friends and I have had a few problems with the game crashing as of recently   I would generally recomend this title to most people out there looking for a fun game to sink some time into
Best with Friends So far the game is definetely fun As of the time I m writing this I only have about five hours on the game though Contrary to what I heard before purchasing the game there aren t many glitches I haven t encountered any glitches yet The machmaking system is relatively fast This game is definetely way more fun when playing with friends though Teaming up with friends make it all around better than playing alone or with randoms So far hackers have been the only problem I have encountered With only five hours locked in I have already player against hackers Despite this being frustrating the game does have developers trying to fix this issue Would definetlely reccomend if you have a squad or friend to team up with Having one or three friends is optimal but having two can work also
tis a ggod game
PUBG s fun comes from losing If you don t like losing constantly before you even get a chance to get anywhere this game isn t for you If you do enjoy it and you also enjoy getting beaten with a stick 247 as punishment for simply existing then go ahead It s the best thing for youHowever it does have solid gameplay and good graphics even if it had a very wonky development cycle So I guess for that it wouldn t hurt to try if it s on sale
You server is rotten
Do not buy this game until they f cking finish it properly This game has great potential i enjoy the game itself what i don t enjoy and that s why i don t recommend it is getting killed by people whose aim is not even close to you and you get killed while your aim is on the f cking guy and you watch the replay and you do 0 hits WHAT THE FoCK IS THIS Wait until they finish the game properly because right now only blind people can play it Spray that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all over and get kills try to aim get killed
Still not ready
honestly bluehole please fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
First Game 8th place Died to a CHINESE CHEATER i report him VIA DEATh CAM so yeah i hope he get banned   
As disappointing as it is addicting Shame on them for releasing this half working mess on the Xbox One and thinking it was a good idea to hold an invatiaional tournament for it as well Cannot recommend this right now And frankly this game has no right to be in 10 right now
The game is really boring in my opinion there is barely any action start mid game the rubberbanding is still a issue when there is 28 million playing this game which is ridicullousThe game is worth a solid 15 20
idk its pretty fun when you dont get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed by terrible servers cheaters broken mechanics network lag detected rubberbanding at the start and finding jack LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  when you finnaly get into a good lobby
The best
If you have a PC that you know is quality and are confident that you can run this game well then I would highly recommend it for the reason that it is simply a ton of fun With friends it is even more fun The game has it s issues hackers are not nearly as big of a problem as people make them out to be though It is just people who are dying and perturbed who leave those types of reviews generally The only complaints I have with the actual design is that there should be more maps and the ability to choose which map you are going to play on
1110th gameNo bugsFlawlessPerfect game
Full of cheaters save yourself some money Worst development ive seen from a game Awful optimization
UPDATE  this game had porblems for a while and it turns out it was on my side Customer Support is horrible though I contacted and it took 2 weeks to get to me and I told them about my problem and it was no use because they just never responded but good game horrible devs
less than hour played this game then get banned no cheating no hacking bluehole plz proof me if i was cheating Very disappointed about this company
Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of a game before I can play this and have fun with it How can I possibly upvote a game that has so many hackers and no way to possibly help anyone that is a little bad at playing it  And also did blue hole nerf the spawn rate of guns in general  I ll go into pecado for example and not find a single gun in an entire two story building and someone pops up with all lvl 3 armor with a SCAR L and just obliterate me in seconds when the game starts This is ridiculous The main focus should be a way to deal with all the hackers and not rushing the game to full launch I love this game and the idea behind it but it needs a lot of work before I can enjoy playing it Oh and don t even consider buying this if your internet is just below anything great and don t even consider it if you dont have the optimal upgrades for your PC either
         _    if u play u know what I mean
Game is absolutely amazing graphics and physics are crazy good
Great game Love everything about it but the servers Can be laggy from time to time and you get rubber banded in the beginning of matches often 8510
ruberbannding and buggy 2 star game
The reason why i wouldnt recommand you buy this get RIGHT NOW is because of the many issues i will give but it doesnt mean the game isnt fun its just unplayable at this current state so come back in a few months and i would recommend the gameWithout further ado here are my few reasons why i would recommend buying this game as of yet1  When play for the first few secounds of the match it laggy as HELL even with me having good internet i bandwith hard in the first few minutes of the game to the point sometimes i lag out of the game Its as if the game s servers cant handle 100 people2  Middle game  when there is 40 30 people left is so borring with most of the time you running around place to place just to find no one then get instantly headshoted from 100 meters away from some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  camping in a house3  The map is to big since there are times where you wont find people for 5 10 minutes even when you running around trying to find people  this mostly happens with my friends in sqaudduo with us running around the area where 20 people landed to find no one This is also extremely dumb during mid game as its just a game of you cant kill the last guy not who can kill the most people4  The amount of bugs and glitchs in this game are insane with veiclhes flying across the map from the smallest ramps and when you run into a motorcycle  with a bigger veichle it will get stuck inside instendly killing you and you re squad5  The amount of hackers in this game from only play 17 hours i have found 10  to my believe aimbotting and wallhacking Its only going to get worse as if they dont fix the anti cheat system it could become like csgo with everyone cheating agianst the other team who is also cheating
I personally couldnt run it ironically after I had just upgraded my pc as well
New map sucks
Pubg is just minecraft survival games for grown ups
Dont force me to play this new gy map
1242018  GAME STILL BROKEN AS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  RANSOMWARE BS TO FORCE PLAYERS TO LOGIN SO THEY GET THEIR STATS UP AS IF PEOPLE ARE PLAYING THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  GAME312018  FUKCN BROKEN GAME DONT BUY THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 3152018  PUBG TRY TO SUE FN BECAUSE THEY CAN T FIX THEIR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LMAO
very good game but i think they just need to make it so laptop players have good fps
Too many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hackers
Calling people retard pregame and in the plane is quiet fun I usually leave the game after that though
PLaying PUBG is very much like making love to a beautiful woman First of all brace yourself hold on tight   particularly if you re sneaking up from behind make sure you have a tight grip on your weapon and don t shoot too early
Hay you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers stop giving me this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  desert map its absolute cancer and it forces me to team kill my entire sqaudEdit  7 Fyucking times
Note  This review is written from an eyes of a New Player as you will be when buying the gameEven though I do recommend this game there are some things that are a pain a big one Here s a list of the Pros and ConsPro A The game is over all fun and challenging B The game is unique   the scopes the modification it lets you choose how to playC You can choose between First Person and Third Person which is a huge plus for people who get annoyed by TPP where you can see people through walls and for people who want it to be as realistic as possibleD It s built on Unreal Engine 4 which in my opinon is the best engine out there  apart from custom made engines but that s a whole new story Or maybe Disrupt but that s UbisoftCons A Rubber banding and the servers are crap two out of five times whenever I land I can t move for 10 seconds and i get rubberbanded back And It s not only meB There is literally NO way of getting familliar with the weapons no gun range no DM nothing so when it comes that you find a sniper in game and you shoot a stay still from 200 meters you will have no idea how high enough the gun would need to be for it to actually hit which is highly frustrating The argument could be made that you could jump into high populated areas and hot fight but that s just pain Nevertheless there have been promised an aim map by the devs but they are running into trouble getting an offline mode for this game The promise has been there for a couple of months nowC The mini bugs Getting hit by a car through a CarePackage losing health when parachuting etc Side note  The game is not really 10  it s only like that to help the salesNeutrals  The game phase is slow may bore some people Overall I do recommend buying this game I hope that when time advances they will fix the bugs and they have the money and fundings too do so an argument could be made that they could just  throw money on the problem  but as they said  It s hard to find good devs 
love the game cant wait to see how far it will go
I have just one think counter this game  Cars have life  they run away from us wen we quit them
This game looks neatEveryone loves it right Oh mixed reviewsI ll give it a shot anyways I m sure I ll like itHmm quality is not the best but the gameplay looks funIt might not be for me but might be for youBut for the pricetag I simply cannot recommend it
EGAD
You ll laugh You ll cry You ll get shot and have no clue where from1010
This game had the excuse of early access previously for performance issues which to its credit where near enough non existant however since this brilliant 10 launch this game is an absolute mess It isnt worth paying anything over 5 for as half of the games you will actually manage to connect to will be a rubber band filled lagging buggy mess The fact the developer has made all the money from this game and release it in such a terrible state is a testiment to todays gaming   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  It is an absolute joke of a game filled with technical errors and much like the console release   worthless Pros Kind of fun when you actually find a gameCons  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  driving physics you will hit a rock 6  high and flip wildly in the air damaging youkilling you and ending your gameThe rubberbanding is an absolute joke its the worst I have ever witnessed in any game I ve playedThe amount of glitches and bugs like teleporting while running and teleporting through doors is unrealThe price of the game is an outrage its a buggy indie messThe graphics are poor running with a GTX 1080The FPS bounces all over the place from 20 140Honestly wait for a deep deep sale do not waste your money especially when games like Fortnite have the same concept for free Is Fortnite a better battle royale game  Not so much Is it a better technical game  YES 1000x overDo not support this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  heap greedy developerEDITED AS OF 110118 The game is now full of hackers and at least 1 in 3 games you will be ruined from miles away by someone called something like  amdhfhs  Again avoid it like the plague
I ve gone back and forth on whether to recommend this or not but the bottom line is this  it s a challenging game  both in physical gaming ability and the strategy necessary to outsmart other players  tactics and it s fun to play Is this a AAA game  Not quite but I think it will be there soon However it also doesn t currently have a AAA price tag eitherAre there major glaring issues with the gameplay  Yes namely the server lag when there are still 80 100 players left alive That being said my most recent matches since the official 10 release have had very little or no lag at all the entirety of the match Within the first day or two of release the lag was as bad as ever so I think the large influx of new players has tapered off and combined with fixes released for the gameservers the lag is at an all time lowPlaying on NA servers I have not knowingly come across any hackers I also usually watch my deathcams and have not seen anything that would suggest I have been killed by any hackers That being said it sounds like hacking is still rampant and needs a more permanent solutionCrashes also need a permanent fix Overall I believe this has been improved over the past couple months but I have still experienced a few game crashes that seem to have been completely randomAgain the driving factor for me is whether or not this is a fun experience overall in spite of the issues with the game That answer is still  yes  If you can survive the first 30 90 seconds of intermittent server lag  ifwhen it actually occurs the next 20 30 minutes you spend fighting to the death are worth dealing with the minor frustrations that still exist
don t like how you cannot change your name in the game and also maybe not the games fault possibly mine but a little bit laggy lke everything else
for all of those saying the game is broken   git gud
The new map destroys the game
Overrated
Really fun to play with a friend  played it just for 4 h and I love it  but you have to lean a lot to be good
pro  u can choose the map nowcon  skins
wasted 350hrs of my life

More laggy than Early Access version Especially on the new map
Please do something about the Chinese not hating them or anything but they need to stay at their region Everytime I join an NA game 100  of the time my teamate is Asian which makes it difficult for me since I can t ask for ammo bandages attachments etc This seriously needs to be fixed

Bought this game so I can t click anywhere on the menu and just rage exit the game    No I bought it to play Fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ffs
Fun game aggravating rubber banding
I am writing this review as I am rubberbanding in game I thought 10 would be better but what s the use of smooth graphics when your server connection is 4 times worse than during testing stage Seriously man
Hello I like this game It is fun to play with friends Last updates was very good with new scopes and optimization But there are too much cheaters Last 3 days 50  games are with cheaters And in 90  cases nicknames are chineeseUpdate info Servers still lag when there are 50 people alive Chinese cheaters still cheating Good thing they made us choose the map
It s a really good game with potential so as long as the devs stay in line  First day of release on the store Me and my friends whipped out our Steam wieners and slapped each other until this game appeared in our inventory It appeared and we downloaded digital unicorns over 152 miles through copper wire to reach our destination Now we don t have god like computers but they re not your grandma s compaq presario either I have a GTX 970m which is running a modded BIOS that allows me to mess with overclocks the factory didn t intend After tweaking my laptop overclocking undervolting and making sure everything was flawless I could play this game with everything set to low and textures set to ultra at 60 FPS with drops into the 20s Didn t play it as much because my friends and I had the framerate of the whatyoufundayson animated women from Japan that like squids So I took out my lawn mower and cut some grass I don t normally cut my grass but it took me 8 months After 8 months a giant Steam wiener appeared in my inventory Same story and boy howdy was it a big relief The test server was born I took a giant seaweed and shoved it into my processor slot At this point I was delusional because I ran out of Steam wieners Fortunately I had good news for everyone of you Rick and Morty fans because my wife took a dump right on the keyboard I made sure to always tell her she was an angel and gold poop she let loose The game ran fantastic on my floppy wiener I was getting 80 90FPS on near max settings with a laptop Boy howdy was I in for a treat when I finally got to enjoy the game I jump out of the plane like a mexican hunting for Corona Once I hit the ground here come all the little grimlins Picking up stuff and wreaking havoc A lot like my damn kids Then outta nowhere someone took my man hood I smashed my keyboard into my own butt hole and uninstalled this trashy game How could I die 15 seconds into a giant hole of dysentery  Me and my friends cracked open a case of cigars and some wild turkey unicorn mating fluid Decided to really try this game We made it till 7 alive and here is that dang inflatable wall came at us again Well we won I know I am supposed to wash behind my ears but after this game I just use a pressure washer I don t wear crusty underwear and my wife has a pee fetish Good game
This game wants me to fap on it
dont want to play on new map but its randomtakes 10 mins to find the other map
After update 10  the game rubber band problem is more worst lag like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  stupid server
I absolutely hate the new map The worst thing is you cant choose which map you want to play
Unlimited Fun
very fun game but the massive amount of chinese players playing on na servers is ridiculus they either have no mic or can t speak or understand english and wind up doing whatever and basically turns into a 1v2 every situation wich completly kills the game for me otherwise no problems
Art  010Sound  210Gameplay  710Lack of bugs  lmao10Honestly this is the most incompetently made game ever made  The texel densities on one main surface is either 2 pixels stretched over 400 square meters blended with 4k1cm2 rubble All assets have stretches in UV channels and very basic flat color and dirt mask roughness Many collisions make 0 sense like car being able to plow through a shed but being stuck by a bucket Or wire link fences being bulletproof one side and not from the otherThis entire thing is broken Its allso bugged to hell and back sometimes you land on the roof and you get jettisoned 500m away from it and die from the fall Otherwise you land on roof spaz and are fine But gameplay at its core is good It forces you to make tough descisions and play mind games with opponents It s amazing to see an hardcore game get this popular
rip my pc   
Friend of mine spent the whole game AFK and ended up in the top 10 s Great game
steam1000   15 
Absolutely horrible game Devs don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about fixing any of the problems Mechanics are dumb as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  especially vaulting and get in the way all the time
Please dont buy this broken game so many things wrong with it so little awarness from the game developers Still so many bugs
Great Graphics  nice open world  become number 1 game most favorite but i hear so many cheaters
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS PEAICE OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING LAGGING LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  AND LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  DESSERT MAP THIS IS 10  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOU
FUN AND DIFFRENT
Kontol update map baru jadi lag parah  bajingan kau pubg
Game itself is good nothing to blame 910However still wey too much cheaters and I ve seen no significance changing from the EA visionSoI dont not recommend  this until you make a difference
this is game is so addicting
Yes this game can be very broke n Once you get past all the BS the 10 patch has given you Death cams Replays of entire games HIT BOXES WHICH ACTUALLY REGISTER and some amount of unplayable lag With friends or even in a challenging solo there is much fun to have Play on Players
Latest update has come with a plague of toxic players   almost every first match of the night I am squaded up with 3 randoms who kill me half way into the match I reported them for teamkilling but have zero faith in any consequences for jackasses like this I get team killed almost as much as I do from legit enemy players Sucks 010
Laggy servers and its just a running simulator with bad hit reg
4 3 183 games in a row died from the game being buggy1 Died from motorbike throwing me off from hitting an invisible bump at speed2 Stuck between 2 trailers in desert map couldn t get out3 Car blew up after running into invisible rock E Sports Ready 
its great and fun but sometimes the servers are laggyy
Good fun Massively challenging If you can t stand losing then it isn t the game for youBut it isn t about that It is more for the fun Even though there are only two maps now the odds of the plane and the circles starting and end in the same spots are lowFor me with low skills my only hope of winning really is good strategy and luck with circles timing and lootIt is a great mix of panic stealth luck strategy teamwork communication and shootin Just because you find the best gun doesnt mean you will find the best scope and enough ammo leaving it somewhat pointless Or you find the best short range automatic gun only to be stuck out in fields the whole time chasing the safe zonesWhatever Best enjoyed with mates in a squad and mixed with teamchatOnly bad thing for me the Chinese Hackers are rampant on OC servers They need to be at least confined to their own region Beyond the point of a joke now
He became     
This is a good game indeed but please optimize the game its so lag sometimes even if I have a good PC specs and also please ban cheaters especially chinese cheaters So many Cheaters in Asia Server
Absolutely amazing game with some of the most heart pumping adrenaline filled gun fights you can get without actually going to a war zone  Highly recommend giving it a go  Enjoy working for that chicken dinner
Unplayable because of lag and FPS drops
If You Can Be Patient And Wait Out While Everyone Kills Each Other Easy Top 10
Too many hackerbut still improving
 Just jump just do it  910
kuuskauttaviis
This game crashes my computer whenever I start the game up I have all the reccomended parts and everything
I mean I don t know I like it I guess although you better be ready to be fully decked out carrying a figurative tank s worth of firepower then just get shot in the head from across the planet Haven t seen any cheaters and while the netcode has gotten much better than it used to be it still needs to be a little more optimized1010 Level 3 Bags worth my soul
Fun game even for someone who don t like playing shooting games Just play casually and you ll be fine
game is unplayable for a few seconds after you land your parachute other than that though its ok
I Highly Recommend This game there are still a few minor issues but its still  worth the price its listed for

An abusive relationship on which you keep coming back to over and over again
Legit game  
The longer you play this game the better you get However the longer you play this game the more you realize just how many bugs are still present The devs seeming lack of interest in fixing the bugs is obvious when you watch them rush the release to console The map rotation is bugged the rubber banding is extreme but its the crashing that has caused me to give up Ive crashed 5 times today I ve had vehicles stop me from driving above 20 only to have my duo have no issue Before the interactions were laughable now it s just plain sad Dont waste your money on this game until they at least put in the effort to make it stable Fun game terrible optimization its getting better but its still god awful The game is just not ready yet
got to say used to be one of the best games around and this is just my opinion people can disagree with me with over 500 hours I feel I can say this and not just jumping on the bandwagon since 10 there has been major problems just naming a few  Lagging nothing worse then 2 steps forward 10 back  Frame drops massive problem still  Hitboxes  The direction of shots its terrible  And the most annoying is having to play that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  map over and over and maybe 1 in 10 games you might get the old map   Even before the update the eu servers have been bogged down with people from asia playing  introduce a max ping easily solved which not everyone is a hacker by the way seen a few people complaining about the amount Chinese hackers on the servers I played with someone the other night who was and even had the cheek to show me he had aimbot on shooting a full squad in the head one after another whats really bugging me is the fact that this update has broken this game and there s a lot of people complaining about it at the moment and it pisses me off knowing that this update was rushed out for xbox and from what ive heard is that thats even LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing worse all im going to say is since this update because they have rushed for the sake of xbox the game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed maybe the next patch might solve all the problems just have to wait and see
I ve given this game so many shots and so many tries but It s been out in full release for a while now and it still won t run well Top of the line gaming pc s struggle to get 144 fps and they re trying to push competition Please fix your game bluehole
its like playing roblox battle royale but roblox is free
Dicky stiffy uh bet she give some licky uh
maaaannnnn this game is a bunch of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poopy LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
AMAZING GAME WELL 2 WEEKS AGO I WAS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ON  THIS GAME SO BAD but now its getting good because im making profit of it unlike csgo that you invest hours and hours and Volvo just gives you 3 miserable cents 1010
Ever since the new update the game has become a lag bucket Dont get me wrong it is a very fun game but because of the 10 pc update it has become very laggy and unenjoyable fix the lag it would be perfect
Yes the game is fun to play with friendscool graphics but there is one issue the rubberbandit keeps pulling me back at a start of a match and that sucks kinda please fix this
sh t game
Bad servers alot of desync huge amount of bugs very poorly optimised 70  of gameplay is walking and looting after playing Fortnite you can really see how bad this game is
Good game just buggy since its not released its early access till the start of the new year but over all great game worth the price not sponcered by them what so ever
TrendingGameOf2017 S O H Y P E D
lots of hours
Has too much lag to even be playable at the beginning making this game frustrating   
Now that this game is in full releasetime to review itPROS  Amazing graphicseven on weaker pc s OK optimisation Extremely  Hacker free  Fun to play Gives you adrenaline rushes I don t know if that is good or badfor me it s goodCONS  Sometimes buildings don t spawn Rage inducing at times Hard in squadscompared to something like The Division or Wildlands Takes time to git gud at No practice modeThat kind of wraps it up for my reviewOverallPUBG is a very good gamea must play for any fps or tps fanand an unforgetable experienceif you have the coin PUBG does indeed have wares for youas the Khajiit would say
You played 30 minmake TOP 1Yeeeeah  Winner winner chicken dinner  and many bp for good game LOL no0 Bp of 0 bp 3 PUBG
This game is nice but still lag and have a lot of bug
I hope his marry Christmas and new year 2018 we can got free code pubg
This is one of those games that no matter how you die you won t get mad and can just keep on going It s also very easy to get invested and not realized how much you ve been playing
good good v good
nah refunded it cos the sh t optimization and the fact that even at the lowest graphics you d never get more than 20fps mostly my PC to blame but why the f ck are your servers so slow 
Why ban my accout for no specific reason  My 700 pesos goes to waste what a shame Wouldn recommend this game if youll just ban any accounts PS I didnt use any hacks LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE T DEVELOPERS
I join NA servers half the players are chinese hackers I hate to be that guy but 10 chineese hackers in a game of 90 people isn t fun No matter how good you are The death cam doesn t help because their screen points to the ground when they shoot its clearly hacking  yet there has been nothing done to combat the rampant cheating
Very poor game development process Lots of bugs and most annoing thing are desyncs You guys developed new map is desyncing hard and there is no option to choose which map you want to play on Desert map is poorly designed and it s very hard to focus on all of the sand there I feel scammed because I paid 30 euros  for a well developed game but instead I got this 210 would not recommend
Zoo Wee MAMA
This it one truly amazing game i ve never been so addicted to one game if your considering buying it don t theres no need to i ve already got 9 hours in the game and i ve only been playing for a couple months With an amazing world filled with dinosaurs and beautiful base loactions it s the survival game everyone can love if your a big fan of pvp vs your ememy atop your favourite dinosaur or if your not into the competitive side of games then play with friends or people online and tame super rare stuff while working towards versing the broodmother With new dino s getting released every two weeks or less there is always stuff to do
JuSt just   dont bother dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bother
After the 10 update I can firmly state a job well done  Early Access Game  Developers really stepped up the plate
Likes   Awesome Graphics  Best game to play with friends  Cool maps  Awesome Guns  Best sound engine  Realistic  ExcitingDislikes  Rubberbanding is super bad  Random Lagspikes
Try to play in SEA or AS server Drop in pecado city and you will get super lag server You can t even move
It feels like the quality of the servers is getting worseThe server really should be upgraded
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING LAG
Please fix the laggy problem It ruins the game
Game bugs take enjoyment out of everything from one way fences landing on spots that immobilizes people and terrible game hit reg  I would not recommend this game for anyone
SO LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING NICE TO ALL NERDS LOOKING FOR LIFE I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING RECOMMEND THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOU ALL WILL LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GONNA BUY THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  AND NEVER SEE SUNRISE AGAIN
fun and interactive game just make sure your bios is up to date or the game will crash a lot good shot count and quite realistic i would definatly recommend the game if you like this style of game
Unplayable Garbage by this point The lagging out don t get me started The fact that I have to slowly die to another player knowing I am lagging out as the punch me to death is the most annoying thing in the world Specially when I have a physical weapon to blunt them with and they have nothing but their fist The hackers They are usually everywhere far and wide and this has been accepted as a challenge for developers to combat You are failing in ever aspect on the war against these hackers who are also making your game complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  My computer is more than capable of running this game on Ultra but I have to run it on very low for a chance to even play and even then I have issues with this game crashing my entire computer specially when I am trying to stream Until you guys can fix this hot pile of garbage I am done I am sick and tired of these early access games like yours giving us nothing but headache after headache
Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers
It started off as an amazing experience but was soon developed into a nightmare of unoptimization and unethical decisions  lootboxes console ports without game being finished etcApparently 720 million isn t enough for BlueHole and they want moreDon t mistake be for a hater I love playing this game very much but that doesn t excuse the developers for being greedy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  If you have console ports and professional esports regarding the game without even having a finished bug free game it is downright misleading and money grabbing and there is no denying thatAlso f  k China servers I hope other battle royales do not follow in their footsteps and make a game because they want to change the industry and not join the EA goddamn church
This game is very funny and much much better than H1Z1Also it is challenging for your computer and your nerves
Love this game Runs way smoother than b4 if u like BR BUY THIS GAME NOW
Please fix the rubber band issue in the 10 release I really can t enjoy the game anymore
This is the best battle royal game on the market ever made hands down There are ups and downs but you can t beat this amazing creation
Must say i m happy to recommend it now after posting a couple of unfavourable reviews over the last couple of months Still getting hacked from time to time but more often than not it s all good
Best battle royale you can buy 10 is amazing Duo and Suad is the best multiplayer you can get Amazing fun
good game now wasn t great in the first place
hyi
A half complete buggy mess
This game is good but they really gotta work on bug fixing like i cant play my game because its all pink and blue idk whats the problem if u can tell me go ahead and do it
need optimization for low end pc and need fpss boost otherwise game is perfect
why change the guns damage and many hacks
gameplay increases and the fps decreases with every updateUnplayable atm
Liked
Very good and adictive game and with more and more updates its getting always better imo with friends its freaking amazibg to play but also solo is fun as hell
laggy and buggy
If you hate yourself this is the gmae for you
A game you love to hate
Rollercoaster of emotions PoS game at times but incredibly addicting and rewarding I can understand why there are so many haters out there but this one s a gem
Fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game Added air drag  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  there is already bullet drop for that you are basically adding double bullet drop Hit register is great D sync  What is D sync  Oh now you added a crate system which requires keys to buy don t you guys have enough money you Korean money guzzzling LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Edit 1  Thank you Blueballs for introducing intense rubber banding in the game
This Game Is Indeed Better Than H1Z1 King Of The HillBut That Is Not Saying Much
Do you like poor optimization  Do you LOVE hackers running rampant  Do you LOVE LOVE LOVE hearing a bunch of Asians screaming in their mics when you selected NA servers  If so Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is for you It used to be in early release but to be brutally honest nothing has changed Buy at your own risk
   
damn you guys need to calm down with dissing this game i know i know this game has got a few issues but once you look past those issues and just start having fun this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing amazingthis game is so much fun with friends and even if you dont have friends this game is super fun I just love having my gpu at 100  for as long as i have the game running great for making a space heater out of your pc1010 would recomend to anyone who has the money and the pc for it
YOOOOOOO PUBG
Her insanolunun bir kere bile olsun oynamas gerek oyun
Still works better than games from EA and Ubisoft
Its been Really fun Some lag and server issues every other full moon The lag and server issues every now and then is not enough to not get this game The game is super fun and you can play for hours and hours just by yourself Adding someone else to play with makes it like a whole new game Get it and lets play
70 lira para verdimBeni ilgilendirmez serverlarnzn doluluu oyuna giremiyoruz
PUBG IS LIFE
buggy pc of S
just another Hype Battle Royale games 
This game is great when it works but issues you will encounter outweigh the good things Server performance is now worse then before There is rubber band lag if you drop in highly populated area This was not an issue in beta Lag disappears when there is less ppl left on the server Client performance is better now but hacker issue is still here Stay away untill they fix these issues 510
Awesome game released the 10 update but it still not ready Need to add more maps more weathers like night snow  need to add more in game charter items And need to add map choice
headshot a guy 3 times with m416 didn t die he headshot me one time with m16a4 i die 1010 would rage againhas perfect internet  10 MBs download speed and is using ethernet cable running to get out of bluezone gets network lag detected1010 again
Good GameI really like the developer s attitude to develop this gamePUBG is getting better and better and the devs definitely deserve a shoutout
PUBG one of the very few that has left early access What makes PUBG so different from the others is the fact that it shouldnt be labeled as 10 it is by far a joke to take it out of Early Access Many of the problems in Early Access are still present which makes it very frustrating One of the main issues is server latency and lag that register shots much later than they should This can be very frustrating leading to hair pulling moments I am surprised anyone who plays this game still has hair This is false advertising labeling this game as 10 this game by far should be beta 10
If your PC is a toaster dont buy but nun the less it s a great game 85 out of 10   could get better over time
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing servers
Just not enjoyable Not enough game modes I really hope the hype dies soon as I learned my lesson buying into the trend of things ps bring back DayZ COME BACK TEAM
PLEASE DON T BUY THE GAME until the devs ACTUALLY FIX the game which they should ve done since the beginning and yet here we are
to many negatives things to list so we will stick with the positive The graphics aren t half bad
play if you like crashing bugs being forced to play a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  map after a ton of hype constantly not loading lag in every single worst situation or just pure autism in a rushed and fully released gameedit  hey guys i finally got erangel instead of the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  desert map after a thousand tries but my game didnt load and it didnt let me join back so i didnt even get to play it anyways
Ridiculously overrated
false advertising game looks nothing like the screenshots
This game is better after the updatebut the lag spikes at the moment when you land is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING IRITATINGif you want to buy this game think twice
patch 10 you cant choose your map and the new map sucksrip pubg
Really Nice Moruq
Tequila Sunrise The most fun I have had playing any game ever This Event Mode was incredibly actioned pack with adrenaline pumping gameplay This event was the only reason I came back to play PUBG I would pay another 30 just to play this event mode again PLEASE BRING IT BACK  3
Lag fest  new map occurance is like 95  and no option to chose the old one  many more problems  10 was supposed to fix things the game became worse than it s state in early access  No I don t have a potato pc
SHieeettt1
crash every time  useless server
Better then Fortnite
Its alright
This game is amazing addictive and all encompassing
This game is just bad The whole series of royale games is a game type only intended for a certain audience of people absolutely If you are in that audience buy literally any of the thousand games that are identical to this The game is optimized horribly It is novel in exactly 0 ways The required amount of times you need to enter the game to play the game is exacerbated by horribly buggy mechanics that will have you stuck in one place for an agonizingly long time The game desperately needs polish and it s been in  early access  long enough to win awards These guys are clowns the game is garbage Spend your hard earned dollars on a game with developers who care
I play this game because i dont mind having to deal with a bad netcode terrible performance and with a lot of bugs when there a some nice skins i can spend my entire paycheck on
            
PLEASE i love this game but for gods sake make an option to choose maps i do not enjoy the new map as the old one and i would like to choose wich map PLEASE
This game is anything but perfectThe servers can be horrendous There are many many bug often game breaking when they occurThe game is in fact slow which to some is a major problem A  running simulator  some call it Which is fairThere are notorious quantities of hackers despite my encounter of only one over 400 hoursSuch complaints can go on for days and many of them are validBut the game is fun That s the honest truth It s a flawed product  despite leaving early access I expect it will remain glitchy and laggy for the foreseeable future but the game remains fun It s true that it can be slow and much of the round is The first 5 minutes generally consist of scouring the area for any viable loot mostly with little to no items of real value found And then the trek begins if you re unlucky with the spawn of the zone In my experience 95  of the time it s on the opposite side of the map It s infuriating If you can t find a vehicle you re stuck running for several minutes hoping its enough to outrun the zone When you finally make it you re sitting behind a tree and healing looking around for someone anyone who would ambush you The landscape is barren devoid of life And then as soon as you begin to move to the next zone a sniper bullet goes through your head That s it You re dead All the time you spent looting running all that is gone to waste and you never saw a soul the whole game So what do you do  Well you either quit in fury or you immediately start another game I am of the latter Immediately you can start doing it all over againWhen you actually find an enemy it s a flurry of action Suddenly having bullets whizz past your head from a suppressed gun in an unknown location is legitimately intimidating Being caught in the open is a nightmare Anyone could have the tactical advantage on you and you ve got to find a way out or forward The gunplay itself is not snappy and ultra responsive like Call of Duty or Battlefield It s in many ways slow and clunky You will wrestle with the insane recoil the sway of long range scopes and the drop and speed of bullets Often it seems as if hits simply aren t registering or the person is an invincible hacker But when you manage to defeat your attacker it s a small moment of exhilaration That s what keeps me hooked on this game  The feeling of victory I feel so much satisfaction lining up a headshot on a far away foe with a Kar98k The game is nominated in the steam awards for  Mom s Spaghetti  and I believe it s the only game not in the horror genre nominated There s good reasoning for that When it comes down to you and a few others in one tiny zone everything silent as everyone tries to spot each other it gets you shaky There s a legitimate adrenaline rush in the gameplay unlike anything I ve ever played The sheer ecstasy in winning my first chicken dinner is one of the best moments I ve had in gamingThe fact of the matter is Battlegrounds is a flawed game From a matter of design its a mess But what has made it the most played game on steam is the strength in the experience of actually playing This game is simply fun to play from the quiet moments running through a forest to the roaring firefights in a city It s the lowest of lows as you take loss after loss but the highest of highs when you claim victory That s the experience of Battlegrounds not a perfect game but a damn good time
Desert map sucks still the same old game rinse and repeat
fun game if you can take the insane rubber banding and poor optimisation but apart from that it is quite a good game and can be very fun with other players
Loading way too longI get killed while I have the loading screen onGeforce 1050 Intel i5 6500 and 16gb of ram should be enough but I guess it s not
Died by getting out of truck with all lvl 3 stuff Would play again 6969696996996969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969
The new uptade sucks actually cuz you can t  select the map that you want pls mrbluehole fix this dumbass LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  thanks greeting Bernardodavinci
This is a pretty bad game It feels unfinished and the rate of development is pretty low despite their unlimited resources
this game is fun when it actually works
fedt spil
when i play this game i run around and loot for 20 minutes and then get shot in the back while running to circle because it is so far away i hate this game waste of time looting simulator running all day
I can t look through the scope because if i do screen will freeze
trash game i dont understand that why i keep getting dust map instead of the old one
I was hesitant to buy this game at first mainly because it was at the time of purchase still in Early Access taht is why I don t have so many hours on it right nowI thought it would never get out of Early Access but regardless of that it s a brilliant game Bluehole could not have been a better company in the making and maintaining of this game unlike other titles such as DayZ and H1Z1 the community actually matters to the Devs and they made a pretty rad game1110
After the 10 release the game is unplayable Beta version was far better and stable Warping and loading makes the game unplayable Lack of map choice is a big disappointment Sound was far better implemented in BetaIt is a brilliant game that promises to be everything better from the beta to the 10 releasebut it just was a BIG effort that went backwards
Early access  laggy buggy sh t10  laggy buggy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Well done boyz  D Best fps where you can t move  DGuess the money is already in the bank
It s a shame what they delivered with 10Instead of putting in a new map  and forcing it onto the players they could have made sure the game runs without lags and framedrops They had the ressourcesThe game is fun no doubt but that just makes the player even more furious It feels like waiting to get your car back from service and finally you got screens on the backseats but the engine runs without oil
Ive spent enough time playing this game to relize that i hate it dieing from random LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  if your the type of person who gets annoyed easily and rages do your self a favour and do not play ths game do not even think about it it is the most triggering game ive ever played AND ive played alot of League of Legends The game is adicting and it always finds its self back into my rotation of games i play but for the love of god i wish i could just never play it again if i was to give this game a rank 1 10 i say 3 is good enough its decent with people but thats it its awesome to watch shroud play unless your shroud level at the game dont play it just watch him and that will be enough for yeahDO not play or buy this game if you get triggered easily i warned you
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lag mother LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er
Boiii this game is good
CHINA NUMBA 2
Frame dropsstuttering server latencyThe game is slowly dying and players leaveI really want to support the game but bluehole makes it very hard for meThe updates are focusing on microtransaction and skins rather than fixing this broken game   
this game has gotten from bad to worse the desync is so horrible its not even funny anymore what kind of retard thinks this is a full game its not even pre alpha
buggy as hellfull of glitches
Im gonna be 100  honest hereBefore the official game release the game was so baddly optimized im glad they changed all thatThe gameplay is pretty fun and interesting once you play a few games Its easy to learn and its a 40  based on luck  its mostly luck about what drops and attachements you get reallyIt is also a fun game to play with friends  1 4 on Squad but it can be sometimes frustratingPs You better mute the freaking voice chat because there s a lot of Chinese people screming a bunch of nonsense on the pre game and also on the plane Happy Gaming
exhilarating and immersive 910
too many Cheater on Early i hope no more cheater Now
The best battle royale standalone game with a cashback of full price of game from selling crates at this time Why you put a dislike 
Why is this a full game  Bluehole pushed an unfinished product to Xbox and now they want to give it to us too Still have rubber banding and server lag in the beggining as well as bad bullet hit reg
There s a reason so many people play this game It s fun and addictive and very challenging to get that chicken dinner Is it perfect  No but the studio is actively improving the game with each patch It has come a long way throughout the year and despite those issues I keep coming back again and again
I ll have a better computer to run this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  end by the time you can figure out where the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you re being shot fromEdit Turns out I got a better computer before they made this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bearable Oh well At least it runs now
Optimise
This game is f    awesome but it is kinda laggi so plz fix  
if you want a game where you jump out of an airplane into an absolute clusterLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  operation in which every person wants to kill you this game is perfect if you dont want to get buttraped by 100 players or have trouble staying alive in minecraft this game is not for you1110 would use grenades and a single frying pan to win again
Alright so overall this game is what you think it is Its pretty fun in my opinion just dont kill any streamers lmao It takes quite a bit to run it andi have a pretty nice setup and with medium settings i get 50 fps which is pretty smooth Buy this game before its 60 bucks and guys im predicting the future haha
best game i have ever played most fun and breathtaking game i have ever experienced actually puts you on youre toes
TOO MANY CHINA 911
This game is so frustrating with all the Crashes to desktop It is virtually unplayable Then after a crash battleeye blocks files and wont start up Have to do a restart of windows to try and start the game again  This is a fresh install of windows and game Still nothing but problems And has been from the very first time I played it in early access It just seemed to get worse after the official launch This game is very unstable I would stay away from it until they put in some real effort into fixing their game If I could get my money back I would Until then its being DELETED
Before update great gameAfter the  new map server laggs seems potatoe are better
I ve had this game for several months  Overall the game is fun to play however the support is absolutely TERRIBLE  I have the bug where my character is always naked and my BP shows NA  I ve tried contacting support who tells you to post in forums  I ve posted in forums and NOTHING  They don t reply to anythingIf you don t start out with the bug you ll be fine but if it happens to get youwell good luck
100  better than h1z1Somtimes in matchmaking some laggs here   maybe cuz new update  I dont saw any hackers ingame Sound is goodFast search for matchmaking   few seconds   better than h1z1 and counter strike  Vote for this game here  D
biggest game in the world says no demand for local servers Play on crap far away servers rubber band when you land and die to somebody who lives next to server
Any game that captures your attention for over 200 hours is something special
295 hours of personal playtime as of the game s full release much of which I enjoyed howeverand I cannot remember the game being in a worse state  I cannot recommend purchasing it at this time It should not have come out of early access
Honestly one of my favorite games as of the time i postedThe new desert map is really fun and all I really want from this game is better optimization as I really want this to be available for my friends to play
The new update actually makes it feel like an AAA game
good gamefun
Best game if you are into battle royale or wanna try something new
Cheaters needs to be perma banned at higher rate every dam game there are multiple cheaters on auto aim and wallhack It seems anti cheat system is not working at all
Not worth the money full of bug s and cheats
Good game but too many hackers
it is indeed fun with friendsedit  this game is trash
Probably the most fun i have ever had playing a game
I didnt spend 30 dollars on this game to have to buy in game items  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you Bluehole
kj
G
The new map is honestly LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE  And ive gotten it like 30 times and havent gotten the original map not once since 10 There needs to be a setting to deselect that trash map Spend like an hour looking for a setting to remove it dont know how the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Shroud was playing the old map on stream
Great but please add a way to choose which map to play on I ve only played the damn sand one 10 times in a row
Gamplay is fun but the Cheaters can ruin your game just be aware of that The most prevalent cheat is the  Tracker  that shows where everyone is at all times I have been killed 4 times now and upon watching the replay it is obvious they were tracking me The best thing to do is drop into the highly populated areas and get into a big gunfight and die a lot while learning the gameBut then why do that when you can play all of the other shooters that let you respawn 
Filled with hackers Company focused on growth instead of fixing current LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  storms
Really impressive
I can not enter the game steam error
I bought this game back in august of 2017 when it was full of glitches and bugs and hackers With the release of 10 now it s safe to say this game is worth it now One of my favorite multiplayer shooters especially in first person mode Still plenty of hackers and bugs and server lag but massively improved apon by the develpopment team even from a month ago All I can hope for is that they continue to make new additions and clean it up as time goes on Well worth the money
great game but my pc cant run it
Version 10Much Update Such Stable ReleaseNo rubberbanding btwNo lags btwNo bugs btwGo fucqq yourself BrandonProtip  Do not play this game soberwithout drugs to prevent serious brain damage
Lags but works
PC 10 is the worst version I ever played on this game Every single second I felt like there was a ghost pulling me to stop me from running after I had been on the ground I believe this is the problem from server However the experience sucks
Jump Land Loot Dead Rinse Repeat 1010 Masterpiece
AMAAAAZING
Terrible game Nothing more to say realy
well this game went to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  chinease hackers every where probably still going to play the game though
Just a good game
Despite much needed work to help fix various bug fixes  particularily in the driving mechanics this game is exceptionally unique and a definite play for its current price tag Although the slow nature of the products devepment is of arguable relation to the success of the game  as it is the number one most played game on steam and the new implication of micro transactions seems to inhibit a lot of character customization I would still recommend this game to anyone with sufficient wifi bandwidth         Enjoy Forget what i posted terrible game hacker problem HUGE  i just died 4 times in a row from a misterios across the map shooter
the best survival games ever
Who knew to be the most played game on Steam you just needed a buggy unoptimized pile of trashCSGO and Dota 2 take notesBut in actuality i m shocked that CSGO and Dota got passed by this and it s not a very good game in my opnionThere s tons of better optionsPro s    The idea   Battle royale s aren t very common to find and it is very refreshing to see this compared to some yearly release FPS games Teamplay   This game is great with friends Playing it solo is fun but with coordination it is even more funCon s    Buggy   There is so many bugs in this game that it s hard to believe it made it out of the closed beta Storytime   Me and my friend were messing around and he accidentally drove his vehicle into mine Luckly I was out of the vehicle but the cars just decided to blow up and fly into space  RNG   Half of the time you get a fully decked Kar98k with a fully decked M4 and all lvl 3 gear the other half of the time you find a machete and tons of useless attachments Even a pro player wont be able to win a fight with just fists against a newbie with a M4  Well most times Driving mechanics   If you have driven a 3 seater motorbike you know what I meanI will change this overtime as the game gets better but these are my thoughts currently
Now that the game has fully released it does run quite a bit better But right now I can t really play in a random squad because no matter what server I choose my team is 3 chinese people  I m American I don t have anything against the Chinese but I m not going to learn another language because the devs won t put in a region lock Honestly if they fix this problem I d have a lot more respect for this game and the devs but right now I m going to have to leave a negative review
Great game but not for anyone who rages a lot You land with nothing but that doesn t make it equal Different people find different loot and some loot is better than othersThe biggest problem is the wait times It takes very long from the time you press play to the time that the play starts flying overhead This means that a lot of the time people wait all that time then die within the first few seconds of landing This can be very frustrating and time consumingThe main other problem is lag and performance There is server lag sometimes and you need an above average computer to run this game let alone wellOther than that the game is revolutionary and will completely change the gaming genre The devs are constantly improving the game and optimizing it so it will only get better from here
I love this game and it has come a long way
This game would be good if there wasn t so many scripters and hotkey macroing that puts players at an unfair advantage over those who play how the game is intended  Also would be nice if the developers actually fixed the problems that occurred in the test servers before releasing the new patches
Good game but needs better optimization
What a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server
I got the game relatively around the time it originally came out in early access and I initially thought it was an alright game I ve never been a fan of the worn out old grassy land scape themes in similar games and I definitely didn t care for it here But here comes 10 with a slew of actual improvements on the game and a very refreshing map I love the desert theme way more It feels way more alive and interesting The ability to climb over barriers and into windos ect was exactly what I had been begging for This game went from alright to pretty good for me and I can justify the 30 bucks I dropped on it now Its a solid battle royale and worth your time if you like these kind of games
Going to start by saying I have 850 hours logged The game is amazing  Pros  Everything Cons  Random bugs here and there Pro tips  Mute voice chat Never stop moving
Would be a great game without all the server LAGGEdit  and all the chinese staying on their servers
This game is by far the most interesting and realistic thing I ve ever played I must have stopped playing it at some point and not realized that I had becuase before I knew it I had killed most of my family and a few others Then I realized that the place I was in didn t look like anything I had seen in game
IZ GUD
i love
I really tried hard to like the game I cannot say that I do after 80 hours 1 Learning curve  it is very steep and requires some time but basically it is a FPS or TPS depending on your settings You need to find a strategy and some tactic to survive but in the end you will wrap your head around it It is way more fun together with peoplefriends2 Gameplay  it is simple drop out of a plane look for a good starting point loot drive shoot Not more and that is one of the let downs 3 Luck  it is also simple the loot is distributed purely on luck You may get a good starting point or some lone guy with a rifle picks you apart because you run for 10 minutes with a shot gun on open field and sadly there are no ducks to shoot with it and even more sadly since you need to be in a zone to survive you need to be heads up to it all the time which requires a car since running for the zone takes ages And that killed me in the last 10 games five times to be just outside the zone and running senselessly for 15 minutes and not finding ONE vehicle Frustrating loot things frustrating running and pure random drops on weapons and vehicles4 Fun  there are fun moments but in the end you need to sit wait for a poor guy to show his head at the wrong time shoot him loot him proceed to the next zone do the same and HAVE LUCK Could be called  Player Unknown BattlefrustrationBattleluck or any way you might put the words And I didnt even mention the cheaters 5 Performance  it is a very consuming game and there are a lot of glitches lag spikes not rendering buildings drop outs the need for restarting the pc and so on so performancewise it is way below optimum Need for improvement6 Conclusion  At the moment I regret buying it since the 30 Euro I could have invested elsewhere it has its moments it is addictive but also super frustrating A nice game for people with paranoia and some skills but a pain in the a for people with above mentioned problems 7 And more    Well try it on a free time or watch some vids Problems is the name of the game  Problemsknown Battlegrounds Cool idea nice features but performance issues like crazy
Overrated s  t game Lagging like hell fps low not PLAYABLE It is a discrase to disrespect players like this when costing 30euros
GAME IS AMZING 10000000010
If you envied this game during its early access I suggest you wait a little bit longer I put about 200 hours in this game before the 10 version release And I have to say that I would have recommended it all the way before that day But with the last update the game lags more bullets reg is worse than it s ever been and the new map is even more boring than the previous one To play that much I can tell you that this game has potential and it will enventually hopefully be a well polished game someday But to launch a  final release  in this state is a shame 
What have you done This was by far the best game I was playing until release Lagging worse then ever Kill cam is great but is showing some questionable head shots as in I was not in the players aimer at all Bring back rain bring back fog Good to see new guns and hitsboxes etc Going to be parking this for a week or two just not as funny as before   
new updated s good 
This game had its ups and downs but right now I really feel this game is amazing The fps drops were fixed my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Gtx 960 can run this game properly now with the 10 patch I ve always liked this game very competitive and strategic when it comes to approaching enemies It takes some time to master and to get the all mighty Chicken Dinner but when u do get it it s so rewarding Having said this the new updates are really amazing with the new weapons vehicles and map Death came and saving the gameplay option Devs worked hard and they have my respect Also need to mention I ve made about 25 through this game by selling the crates I buy with Bp    Thanks game Also has a few chinese cheaters but you know every game has cheaters   9510
The best game of all time
Fun game amazing shooter but has some bugs but other than that its a great game
I used to play the game before it was officially launched and had no problem whatsoever It was actually fun to play and the servers were so smooth that I could play in NA without lagging  I m in EUW Now the game is out and it is absolutely unplayable Even Battlefront 2 wasn t this laggy when it got released  How is this possible   How can this be allowed   It s supposed to be the other way around I could understand that a game in ealry access has lags and then it gets patched for release But I can t understand that a game that used to run smoothly can become this broken upon release It is absolutely unacceptable FIX THIS QUICKLY or this game will suffer greatly from this I for one won t be playing this until something is done about the lagsFor a multiplayer only game this is a very bad start An official release shouldn t be this catastrophic
Game is so intense and competitive to the point where I almost got a heart attack Not recommended for old people
When a game comes out of alpha it should mean something not just a slight change in the title
An intense game of survival Run try to vault and remember they haven t implemented vaulting as you get sprayed by a tryhard with a scar But all jokes aside this game is really good and for 26 it is a bargain Just make sure you don t get caught in the redzone because both your character and your cpu will blow up
This game single handedly revolutionized  the FPS genre Don t listen to the haters it s perfectly optimized with amazing graphics now
i love this game so much put plss fix all sarvers
This is a really good and non repetetive gameI stopped playing CSGO and now im only playing this game 30 for this is very cheap and for a game this good i would easily pay even 50
Launched and still unoptimized and very poor servers do not buy in current state
66666
ping too high
It was good at first but every updates make the game worse
awesome game  
Love it got some bugs but only to laugh at  much fun 
HOLY h1T
game dont work
The new lobby and the new patch for this game is absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Matchmaking doesnt work bugs and glitches and especially the server are down in all server like why
10 feels like its in alpha phase never ever buy cant even connect to game with a stabilized 10 version cancer 10
          35        Early acces    10                    
China Numba ONEE
very addictive game with the official release things have gotten hairy tho i HATE HATE HATE the new map  aka   LLGG  Laggy Laggy Glitch Glitch please fix that crap
Best shooter i ve played in years
10 my LOVE LOVE LOVE 
At it s best this game is like crackThe feeling of beating everyone else and assuring your delicious chicken meal is an awesome feeling especially if it was your first However the game is suffering heavily from hackers currently Devs need to step up their game this was supposed to be the answer to the lack of content H1Z1 put out now it s just  whoever has the best cheats wins As of Apr 15 they ve been able to cut down on cheating substantially The game could use some improvements particularly in the content section as well as gun tweaks New maps are on the way and very much welcomed but please fix the vehicles
How to change the name of your account sir 
such a god game love the combat but triggers me so much sometimes
 Great release  this game lags so much now In early access there were no so many drops as we have now I have got a good PC  i7 32gb gtx 1070 and nice ineternet connection Still I can t enjoy this genre as I simply can t play this game because of lags lags lags Do not by it now you will get a lot of  good  emotions
the best game i have ever played PUBG for life  3
This game is absolute trash and a horrific expirience to play With the new update comming out I was hoping that they would improve on the game breaking bugs and problems such as desync rubberbanding and shots not beeing registered Landing my parachute and having to run the same distance for 3 min because of desync is killing any enjoyeble expirience this game provides I really wish the developers would work on the basics of the game instead of adding more features and maps to an allready broken game
It s an interesting concept but I m not sure I really like it that much Maybe it s just me but running around a large open map for 5 minutes before being killed in two shots by a player I didn t see with much better gear than me didn t really make for an engaging experienceOn top of that the customisation options are laughably limited Apparently there s more available through a lootbox system which is quite frankly a stupid idea You buy lootboxes using points earned in game and get random cosmetic rewards from them Why not just have a cosmetics shop and let us pick what we want to spend the points on  Or better yet don t start us off with such a laughably small collection of cosmetics just so you can stick a bunch of them in a token gambling systemThe game seems stable enough I heard a lot of complains about glitches and hackers but I didn t run into any during the three matches I played What I did find incredibly annoying was half the time I tried to play the game refused to work because the servers were too busy I didn t pay 2599 for a game that I can t play if it decides it has a headacheWhich brings me on to my final but by no means least relevant complaint the price This is NOT a 26 game this is a 15 game at best and even that might be being generous What you get for the ridiculous price is nowhere near worth it even if you enjoy the 100 player battle royale thing I complained earlier about the lack of cosmetics and frankly I d say any game that has the gall to lock half its content behind a lootbox system should not be charging this much as the base price This is probably just down to my taste but if you like shooters there are better games out there and if you like survival games there are better games out there This is really just an okay at best game that was massively overhyped by livesteamers and I wouldn t recommend buying it until the price drops considerably It s not a bad game but it s certainly not worth the price
Servers can t handle it lobby and matchmaking is very buggy Handling feels unresponsive Far from being esports ready
PUBG is a game with an insane amount of potential and I hope that it channels that potential in the upcoming year after the 10 releaseEven though server lag or rubberbanding can be very upsetting this game has a unique ability to pull you back in I recommend it in the sense that the now following updates hopefully improve the overall optimization and therefore the overall enjoyment this game can bring
aloha snackbar
Game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
What a tremendously bad game Don t waste your time with it It s a laggy mess that is barely playable
2 people alive in game will make you faster heartbeat than ferrari
The amount of hours ive put into this game means you should take my review as mustard It s alright
worst game on earth
 specbar 
poorly optimized hackers and for some reason they dont reduce the price during the winter saleu should play it with mates otherwise it is boring
This game has some really high highs but is overal a real piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  more than 60  of the time If you don t mind the game crashing at least once a session cheating so rampant that you can expect to die to one every third game rubberbanding and server lag like you re on dial up and the lobby client taking full minutes to load regardless of pc specs then the game is worth picking upI have a lot of hours into the game because the base formula of the game is phenomenal You should expect issues as above in early access games so it was easier to swallow early access except that most of these issues didn t even exist when I started playing In fact the only two of the above that actually were an issue 8 months ago was the occasional game crash  once every 6 hours or so and slight server lag as the game started that clears up within a minute but overall not bad As they added to the game the client went through some of the worst bugs I ve ever seen in any game ranging from the issue that exists today  which somehow transcended between lobby clients and is somehow even worse right now to absurd things such as leaving your team mates in seperate queue s if changing any of the options to he queue and the only fix to this was to reload the game entirely That particular bug lasted FOUR months The cheating while very disheartening should be excpected in any wildly popular game Sadly because of the format of the game it feels like there s at least one in every other game  and this was actually true at the height of cheating and bluehole was admittedly unprepared for this games  success Also the design of how pretty much everything in this game works is on client side instead of server side making it easy for the cheaters to do absurd things like raise your gun  to literally anywhere on the map while only your physical body is vulnerable permanent invisibility one shot kills  even ignoring downs with any weapon and of course your casual speed and aim hacks I have other issues with the game but they re mostly personal so I ll be keeping them to myself Ultimately I will be coming back to this game periodically to see which of these issues have actually been fixed   expect this game to be worthwhile in 6 12 months but in the meantime I suggest saving yourself the migraine of chasing the magic dragon of legitimate gameplay for another several months as the game is still very much  early access  despite the tag of official release Buyer beware
Best game out there
Although I have fun playing with friends I would never play this game alone The lag issues and the menu issues are a big problem and that doesnt even inlcude the amount of cheaters I dont understand how you can t even get a menu working it baffles me I guess you should have stuck with modding
sorry THIS IS A GOOD GAME
122217 how long is pubg down for today 
server always bussy and lagg WATAFAKKK
F king trash server
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  s fun and doesn t run half as bad as people say
Endless Fun to play with your buddies  limited to 4 tho xD
I didn t hang up with my friend three black FPP hit me suddenly said what global ban after all the time I have been complaining for four days still have no news The open you blue hole is not sealed do not open the unsealed the jedi survival is you out of the real bad luck
Don t buy this game if u hate campers because this game is full of em Shooting is horrible lots of bugs lagging bad servers and damages are so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing random
this game deserves gulag
Playing this game has made me paranoid1010
 rep full released and and game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up played 3 matches and all servers crashed played with my frnds and same for them now it irritating as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Although the game is released now they still have not addressed their horrible servers They game is still very flawed and I think the release was forced way too early
Amazing game rubberbands like crazy sometimes but will play 4 dat chicken dinner all the time
Game 55   Playing experience 25While the game itself is excellent in its simplicity  a bunch of people scavenging for weapons and going at it with the last one s remaining the winner it would be even better if it actually worked relatively well Small bugs that make you run while blinking back a couple of paces now and again are annoying but now not even that incomplete gaming experience is availabe as servers are offlineIn short   the game itself is excellent  at least during the early access phase it was It does not run smoothly though and we probably have millions of patches  as usual to look forward to YayAnyone interested in buying this game would probably do well to wait a few months as the game is nearly unplayable at times at the moment When it IS playable however it is one of the most exciting and addictive games out there Regardless of whether you like 1st person shooters or notI recommend this game to everyone when it s finally ready in a few months
Best PvP game out there
this Best
I have never really bothered to write a review for any game I usually only purchase games that I know that I will like based on other s reviews thus I am always happy with what I get But PUBG is the exception to the rule and I regret buying it like I have never regretted buying any gameIs it addicting  yesIs it fun  maybeIs it worth its price  F CK NOand that s because it s perfomance is a joke I own a laptop perfectly capable of playing the game and still every time a sound effect will result in the FPS falling to around 15 It s ridiculous YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR ASKING MONEY FOR SUCH A SHODDY PRODUCT
Play to afford a crate Open crate Get another crate you need to buy a key for with real money wtfAfter purchasing the game this feels just cheeky and greedy
The Most Fun i have had in a long while
Fun game if you want to  Play with a few buddies  Play alone  Play with total strangers  Hunt the most dangerous game  Kick it on a condemned Soviet island  Experience true fear  Stove someone s head in with a cast iron frying pan  Get your head stoved in by a cast iron frying pan  Learn to fear blue circles
The ultimate must have battle royal game needs bugs fixes though
If only there was a mac version for the game how nice would that be
Hands down the dopest dope I ve ever smokedBut really PlayerUnknown and his crew have really outdone themselves This game is absolutely amazing1010 would reccommend
Its a great game although still bugged even now we are on V1 I am still showing player NA and cant earn BP
Fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing network it s lag fest Unplayable
WAKE UP You can t own a game genreI would really love to recommend the game but I can t I loved it when it started Now I hate it end of story
very fun ignore all the bad reviews worth all my money  well my dads money thats the privilage of living with your parents
This game is great and I dont really understand all the hate Playing in EU and haven t come across any hackers
too  bad

umm the update is not working for me for some reason i tried connecting to severs but is says the severs are busy and it won t let me get on
Amazing launch great job guys
Overall the best first person shooter on the market They have had issues with bugs and lag but overtime have cleaned it up Waiting on the server official opening pushed back another hour  ____  However the most fun I have had with friends in a long time while playing games
well its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed bc no update has ever come out on time Even 10 launch
I think you could argue this game is more fun to watch than to play but the same could be said of a lot of games When you work your butt off to get a solo chicken dinner  win or work with a squad to pull out a nail biting win you will realize why playing this game is fun It takes a long time to get to the point where you won t make mistakes frequently or die early on but it s worth the effortYes I do have 12 on this game Don t judge I m busy having no life
Refunded this game to pay for xmas gifts for my brothersI miss itAlotGet me it papi
Why I cant play the game 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  u cao ni ma
Used to play heaps  400 hours on record but since the v10 it s unplayable   at least in my OC region The servers are so bad you can t run from one side of a room to the other without rubber banding 4 times   let alone get a kill when it comes to combat
dum
its alright
Why do you think that bringing this game out of early access is a smart idea  This was a horrible path to take and the game is going to get a lot of bad rep for doing this People are still constantly crashing and finding a large quantity of bugsglitches This game needs to go back into early access and stay there until it is well optimized so people won t see consistent hit register problems rubberbanding crashing not loading into the game invisible menu etc The list goes on I must admit it is a fun game but it is not worth the price right now Plus they brought it out of early access too earlyYou will get 20  fun and 80  aggrevation out of this gameGLHF and i hope you don t constantly crash like some of my friends do
the issue isn t region lock the game has had me squad up with some pretty chill people from China and all over the world the issue is the hack protections and this game cannot get its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together with preventing cheaters
Im grateful for the friends Ive met over the past year while playing this game Ill be honest im going to miss the trash version but im excited to see all the new changes finally come together Though at times frustrating Ive never gotten angry or disheartened enough to stop playing PUBG is and forever will be one of my favorite games for the memories and fun ive enjoyed since early access
 GET THE CHINESE CHEATERS OF MY NA SERVER
Game is extremely fun and competititve Amazing graphics and great maps
Once you eat chicken you will forevermore hunger for it
Recent launch forced massive amounts of  cinematic  visual effects  bloom effects depth of field etc on to even the lowest graphical settings Players who are negativly impacted by these changes should avoid this game
the game is very broken and kinda gay but all ur friends bought it so you should too
nice laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it s a good game hard as hell though i didn t get any lag during my playthrough but i have a pretty decent computer and connection no idea why this game is marked as mixed my only guess is that people can t handle the heat most games these days are too easy put people up against humans and it gets intense i ve only killed two people so far and that was luck even so trying sneak around and get in a headshot on someone and while not being seen is awesome
no achievement no fun
needs more customization for settingsbetter optimization otherwise a fun game to play
Fix them servers but the game is good
hello  world you  yes goodbye  earth
Extremely good game when it works I ve sunk a fair bit of time into this game   was hoping for more of a finished product upon full releaseUnfortunately game still works only half of the time Suffers from desync constantly crashes and servers are a bit of a nightmareBest way to play this game is in a squad but as mentioned earlier it s rare for everyone to load in or for someone not to crash If you enjoy gambling then you ll love this mechanic as you never know who s gonna load in or experience some game issueI d also like to play the original map every now and then and not get put into a game on the new map 95 percent of the time I understand Bluehole that you want players to enjoy the new features you ve mustered between your cocaine infused yacht trips But you don t need to shove said features down your player base s throats
Games still in early access it seems
y e e t  on the poor victims running in open valleys
This game is a broken unpolished turd that is pretty much unplayable I glitch in and out of rooms constantly drop from games it crashes freezes and is just horrible Don t waste your money
I love it when I encounter a hackercheater every other game
This game was fun when I first started playing Now it s become a series of frustration mainly due to all the wasted effort and more importantly TIME in each game spent only to be abruptly ended by this overwhelming influx of hackers The game developers have done very little to counter this problem and their means to do so are useless Plenty of people hack and they will get banned subsequently with enough reports but that is irrelevent since they will end up buying another copy of the game to repeat the entire process The hackers dont hide their presence and are unafraid of the anti cheat system Their in game names clearly tell you they are hacking since they put no effort into creating a name and instead put random letters and numbers They have so many copies of the game that it is completely useless to get rid of them The developers in turn make more money off these hackers from repeated sales of copies Honestly its a sickening and vicious cycle that puts normal players at a huge disadvantage and offers a very a negative gameplay experience Even with the recent 10 launch the hacking has not diminished in fact it has increased by many folds Sad I have truly understood what it means to literally rage quit a game due to severe frustration
Fix the god damn lags your company has made millions from this game cant affort a decent server 
I enjoy the original map much more than the old one I will be able to recommend the game once you can choose which map to play
before the update it was bearable even dare i say it playable but now its a laggy heap of steaming bugs and off key aiming please fix the game i so much enjoyed
Don t buy this game I recommend buying a book instead Here are some recommendations  The Orphan s Tale The Catcher in the Rye Thus Spoke ZarathustraEnjoy your reading experience  
Can t recommend a game that took a little effort to code but failed to produce a effective enviroment to play in Whether this is found on a number of technical issues or a number of hackers I cannot enjoy a game that also has a high skill ceiling and floor and also has auto lose conditions built in like network problems
Eh it s okay
Nice 
i like it  
becoming the worst game ever the chinese started invading the game so much so im quiting this game for good and i know my review will get deleted cause im speaking the truth good luck with chinese hackers they will always get through your security or any other security no matter what you guys do or any other game does good luck with banning them thats all you can do xDfix your game cant even connect to its own servers and the problem is even your support team cant help solve it xD

1010 Got me back into gaming
In game mechanics need working and game needs to be further optimized to run on lower spec pc s Otherwise it is fun with friends only playing on your own gets boring real quick For the state the game is currently in I would not recommend spending over 20 euros unless you are willing to fully commit all your time into this game to get any value out of it
Besides that one guy  Dr DisRespect  cheating it s a great game
I really enjoy this game it has a diverse game play everytime Who knows if your team will speak your same language and maybe they will just kill you after you find a gun they want LOLThen theres the super large map you could have a great round find all the guns you ever wanted and a sweet MotorBike full of gas hit a bump going to fast and die HAOr have the worst game ever find nothing but pistols run for miles on miles and then get 5 lucky flank kills LOL Love itIt has issues sure It hasa Hackers they say abot everyone who kills you HA I find it addictive and requires alot of focus to do well
its broken
Great Game A a little bit of lag when you are loading in game but it is very fun and competive

Amazing game that is hated by poor kids who play F2P Fortnite
nicesu
Im reviewing this right before early access to look cool its a fun game if you cant render the game its not the games fault entirely you are also partially to blame dont downvote and give this game a terrible review because your computer cant run this game it just isnt an honest gameplay reviewwith all that said this game is really fun I would recommend giving it a try especially now that its coming out of early accessI will make a lengthy review later  Again I just wanted to review during early access to look cool
A fun game It does has a fairly high learning curve for new players and it gives medium spec computers a run for their money Even so I think its worth the price compared to other games similar it  eg h1z1 dayz
A literal pile of sh t
I love the game amd i play it all the time This is by  far the best game in my opinion The only bad side to this game is all the hackers its getting crazy how many people run esp in this game If they could get rid of the hackers so many more people would play this game They need to do something about the hackers because a guy that loves the game cant take much more of the hacking it makes you rage quick and to not wanna play the game anymore So pubg please get that figured out
It s the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Playerunknown s Battlegrounds  PUBG is a game that I find very impressive yet do find some problems in If you are someone that is checking through reviews and seeing all the mixed reviews hopefully you can come to this one and determine if it really is worth a buy Performance I play this game on a pretty good PC and  have fairly good FPS I actually just ended a game where I had around 120 FPS the entire game  THIS IS AFTER THE 10 PATCH Since the update the game runs as smooth as butter and is a hell of a lot better than what it used to be However like every great game it does have drawbacks The server stability can be pretty horrendous at times There has been many times where the game has crashed right when I open it up and even the  reporting window crashes when I try to send in my problem This happened today AFTER the patch but I blame this due to the high traffic the game is experiencing today after such a massive update Overall the game doesnt have the best server stability at first but gets pretty good when the ball is rolling  in my opinion Graphics Honestly this should be the lowest concern I run this on pretty low settings and the game still looks pretty solid If you are wanting a beautiful game that can push out over 100 FPS I honestly don t know if this is the game for you i never tried it In this game s case I favor performance rather than how beautiful the game can get You are not going to win your games with how nice the grass looks  _ _ Hacking Hacking is something that is a definite problem in this game but at the same time I feel like it is hard to tell in some cases This might be an unpopular opinion but I feel like some people just need to get good or not complain I honestly believe hacking is the first thing people go to when they shoot a character a lot the character does not die but instead kills them Hacking is something that is a definite problem and a problem that I hope PUBG fixes but expecting every hacker to be eliminated after a single patch is a pathetic Someone is always going to go around the patches so they can cheat and expecting a small studio like Bluehole to fix it instantly is preposterous Valve hasnt eliminated all their CSGO hackers yet bluehole gets the knife when it hasnt even been a game  I think for a year Again a pretty unpopular opinion but one that I think needs to be said To Conclude PUBG is a great game to play by yourself and even better to play with friends If you can honestly say you have a good amount of patience and a pretty good rig you will enjoy youself Updates will come to fix issues but dont look down on an overarching experience because you might have died to a hacker or your game crashed on your 2 3 hour of playing If these events happenjust start the game again  Hopefully you see this and can confirm if you really want to put your money towards the game or not just be patient
it s only fun for a couple of hours after that it s basicly the same thing over and over just better make it free to play with that lootbox LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is a sad excuse for a full release Never buy another game from Bluehole
ok where to startthe game idea is greatporly execututed fps inventory and game physicsif you have friends get this gameif all youre going to do is play solo si would stick to h1z1
This game will raise your heart rate tons of fun  and frustration that will keep you playing match after match for hours on end
This game is really fun however it seems to randomly switch me into the Asian servers Furthermore in the latest update they removed the ability to trade items you can only sell them on the steam market this seems like a cash grab as they get a percentage of all sales on the market
what 
They don t focus on optimizationPUBG Corporation   We are working as hard as we can Who s WE PUBG PUBG Corporation   The people in my head Geforce Experience   WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING 
Very gud
One of the best shtty games I ve ever played
If you enjoy these things this game s for you High hacking populationMinimal lootRunningAwful driving mechanicsAwful spray contolsGetting killed from behindOverall the game is great and Blueball Entertainment has a true gem here
just buy it ignore the negative reviews good game
Just an amzing game overall and rewards the good players and keeps the average ones addicted to keep trying for thir chicken dinners If you are debating buying this definitley do it ignore the reviews I have not had barely any glitches and stuff that others state and a reminder this game has not been out long and was put in early access because it only had one year of develpment and it is this far so ya know
One of those games that keeps you coming back for more I ll admit it can be clunky at times loading screen lag etc but when it runs well which it does on my computer it s a fun game There s a reason it s the most played game currently on Steam People might like to bash it but 2 million people don t lie
Devs are scum
i mean its good enough
Games Terrible Version 10 Released New Feature added Elastic Banding Instead of fixing problems on test servers that have been in the game for months they just release more crap to the Live servers Landing bugs and you end up falling off a roof to half health but its okay we changed the icon for the 1911 The list goes on
PUBG early access was amazing but 10 is the literal definition of cancer New graphics are a step down everything looks plastic whereas the pre 10 version was great Miramar is the worst idead for a map and is rushed Looks terrible sand looks unrealistic new guns are just pointless The list keeps going PUBG needs to take Miramar out and polish it to a level where it actually looks good
Just another BROKEN game after updates reminds me of ARMA 3 this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  broken
Still lagging as hell
Good game and definetely fixed most of the bad things in this game  D
While the game is a lot of fun I have to agree region lock this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  down You can t drop into a NA lobby without a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  load of chinesejapanese people shouting at each other at which point ya promptly quit and decide to come back later
This is my favorite game right now and I highly recomend it it is very realistic and really fun the devs are working on it hard too and there are lots of bug fixes coming out There is only one problem which in my oppinion is a very big one  every time a new update comes out that does something then when I try to log in it says  Servers are too busy please try again later  believe me that gets old really fast once again though I fully recomend this game
30 minutes of gearing up then somebody shoots you Rinse Repeat
Fun Game Hard and Stressful  Like most 1st3rd Person shooters But worth it
 pubg becomes a full game  oh sweet let me see if its changed in anyway opens pubg crashed Perfect oo
 
FIX THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING RUBBER BANDING
Patch 10 came out  YAY or NAY   Pros   They fixed the fps issue the performance is way better than before I can tell The new menu is really nice and finally supports ultrawide resolution New map looks nice and has nice spots The new navigation system is much more precise  you can now give calls way more precise due to the numbers showing on the radar thing which are going in five steps Example  Enemy is at between 0 15 now shows you the numbers 0 5 10 and 15 Cons   At this point I clearly have to say NAY because the game is still buggy af servers are still lagging as hell at the beginning of the round you still need several times to just pick up ONE item The fps STILL drops down sometimes even to 60fps There s no way to choose between the maps or the weather conditionsSo my afterall review  They went out of Early Access way to early they should ve put more time into performance and server stabilisation
got banned for  hacking  despite using no cheats and now i wont be able to play the new update 010
Poor optimization stupid server and plenty of hackers The game experience is completely disappointing If these basic problems can not be fixed with sincerity this game can hardly be judged as a great work
popular  yesconcept  nicebandwagon  yesoverrated  yesjust like h1z1minus the scopecashgrab  yeswill it ever be stable  maybe when another game launches and takes it away again
this game is awsome
1010 Very good
Is good gam would recoment
Q BIEN  
Love the game had it since 3 days after release Its a good game Id reccomend you buy it if you dont have it Of course there are many things in the game that i dont agree with or how they are done But then again im just 1 of the 20 million people who bought the game Good game none the least buy it rage say your never playing it again and then play it the next day just to get 1 tapped by a double barrell 17 yards out
a lot of fun  Its a must buy 910 After 10 will update review  
seriously if you are playing this game and you are from China kill yourself
Only drop at schoolIt s where you get knowledgeand rage quit1010
By far the best game I have played With the test servers showing off the valting mechanics is proves that the developers arent t here to suck money out of the community The ENTIRE map has different movement mechanics all dependent on the position of the player The speed moving and the wall or fence you are navigating through just shows that this game is well placed as Game Of The Year 2017 Then again Post Malone Playes the game So something must be right here Only issue is optimization I have two 750ti s and a core i5 4690k with 16gb of ram and I only run 40 60fps on all low settings So deffently some room for the developers to optimize some Other than that best AAA game i ve played
Unfinished game being declared  finished  and is being released in a few hours with its god awful bugsglitches and its hoard of chinese players invading and ruining other servers now im no racist but how am i supposed to play squad when i get stuck with these chinese players who just TK and dont speak english aside frome  CHINA NUMBA ONE  or  LOVE LOVE LOVE  YO MOTHER  or  I LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOUR MOTHER  what the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  man
No ping lock no anti cheat and the hackers know it and a cheap game which means inexpensive copies to repenlish if you finally get banned Terrible development
FOLLOW ME 
 pre 10 Fun to play with friends but it runs horribly  Horrible FPS AND Server Lag the rewards are next to nothing and its overpriced at its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  state right nowThe desert map and new vehicles are great although they should add guns that actually are useful past the first 5 10 minWould recommend if it went on a sale otherwise wait for 10 
After I die  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE4 hours later  Just one more game
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the stupid new map i decide to quite the game
Amazing to play solo or with friendsi could be playing this for hours at a time
Game is full of bugs and glitches doesn t have more than one game mode and only two  big  maps  as of 12 21 17 no weapons training tutorial too many non purposeful  items clothes very high hardware requirements compared to steam page listingserver lag is very bad at the start of gameetc The game is getting better new desert mapbetter fps but it feels like it s taking forever   come back in a couple of years and check to see if they have improved any of these problems I would personally not recommend this incomplete 10 Release game
After 300 hours and its finally fully released this game is awful hackers everywhere now the new map i get stuck in a wall or invisble barrier try and pick up a gun and get slingshot back to 10 seconds before or just run the same 50m and get flung back over 100 chicken dinners used to be good not anymore
i havent seen many hackers i know a lot of people are saying they are ruining the game but there is people like that in every game this game is great if you want a quick fix to feel accomplished and after this patch it is better i would say for 37 that it is worth the money
AWESOME fun and challenging
Good game and good concept however some minor tweaks could be made to make this game even better for example the chance you have to find a gun other than a pistol or shotgun is quite small when you first land except when you got to the larger areas this makes the gameplay quite unfair in my perspective Another thing that i think should be added is a smaller map this can be better for the aggressive playstyles having a smaller map also eleminates the long runs you have to make to the safe zone Having a large map creates an extended amount of time in which players will not see another player for a long time In many of my games i have spent 5 10 minutes running across the lage map just to be killed by a player camping in a building Having a smaller map would take away these problems and make a fun quick and explosive gaming experience Other than these issues this game is good and would be fun for any FPS player
really not ready for full release still the same bugs as pre release wish i was fine with cause it wasnt ready yetbut how they call this game ready is beyond menetwork lags unable to connect to servers raubber banding you name it its still all unresolvedits a absolutly lie that this game is ready for full release check back after a couple of updates if you want to buy the game and expect a lag free smooth experiencebut do i like the game yes it has been fun in the moments it runs smoothdo i recommend it in this state absolutly not like i said wait till the bugs and lags are fixed in a couple of patches then it should be good hopefully
Good game enjoy it
However good this game might seem to you there are still a lot of underlying issues that have still not been adressed by the team working on this game Such as  Low FPS and often crashing for a lot of lower end pc  i havent encountered this personally but a lot of my friends have and also another issue that has been surfacing recently after I downloaded the test server was that it couldn t lauch either of the games It would constantly come up with and error box saying  Windows cannot access the specified device path or file You may not ahve the appropriate permissions to access the item  I think it means that the test server ruins the file path Also their are more problems with the servers In the 100 hours of this game I have played at the moment aroud 60 hours of my games I have experienced rubber banding which has resulted in my death multiple times which is very frustrating when you are trying to improve different skillsAll I am really getting at is don t expect a good smooth running game when you purchaseif you purchase as their are a lot of frustrating things that ruin the game for mePS  Shroud is an example of the best this game will run on a really good high end PC so dont expect to get that kind of performance unless you are running on a really good PC I have a good PC and I don t get over 60FPS and it is almost like it is capped at  60 Bluehole please fix
Best battle royale game ever
I like as much as i love Russia
Verry nice its like dayz but more fun
The only good early access game on Steam
Its Good Competitive but it can be better
Lots of hackers and games stops working bad modular in a middle of a matchIT DOESN T DESERVE FULL PRICE
No more trade  click 
Have you ever wanted to play a game that has all the problems of an early access game with it no longer being an early access game  LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THISI ve played this game for a long time in early access and it has been a lot of fun In early access it can be sometimes even funny to have stupid bugs and laggy servers that crash occasionally  it s all part of the deal essentially BUT IF YOU FUKKEN RELEASE A GAME REMOVING IT FROM EARLY ACCESS PURGATORY IT SHOULD FUKKEN WORK AT THAT POINT This game does not
I apologize for my bad English Thanks to Google for translat my letter  review  Dear PLAYERUNKNOWN I am writing to you from a distant cold north western part of the Russian Federation or more simply from the Republic of Karelia My name is Andrey I m 22 years old I became one of your big fans after playing in your modification to the game ArmA 3 I mean BattleRoyal  I apologize if I wrote the name of the mod slightly wrong there like all the capital letters but I unfortunately do not remember played a very long time Then I believed and still believe that this is a breakthrough in the gaming industry a regime where hundreds of players are released to the open terrain where they have to kill each other with what they find in this locality And this mode is called Battle Royal it s cool isn t Thanks to you I decided to learn more about the setting of the Battle of the King  I watched two parts of the film of the same name and all sorts of trash American films like  The Condemned  and  The Hunger Games  read a couple of books where deytvie occurs in a similar genre in general was not boring I learned a lot of things about survival in different conditions Maybe someday it will come in handy but I hope not Thanks for thisAnd now perhaps I will go to the root of the problem because of what I m just writing this review Rather when you were an ordinary mod designer I would not write about it But now you have a serious company and on the sales of this wonderful game you earned I m sure a lot of money So buy more servers and if possible put them in Russia  I put the search game waited 10 minutes got angry went to the grocery store for an hour came back and wait for it the game is still being looked for How i must understand this  I spent 120 of my salary on your game but I can not play it because you see it s not looking for a game And yet it is badly optimized  in main menu at the low graphics settings I have a slide show Correct pleaseI hope you will see this appeal to you or I will have to return my money sorry                                                                                                                        Sincerely PyaoFacer

Very bad gamefps LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bugs and just hackers many
Great concept  loads of cheatershackers Needs region lock to prevent laggy servers
Full of bugs
Amazing game   But the game need some Middle East servers
its good but will fail if they cant keep hackers out
I have 500 played hours and yes it had many many bugs but now it feels so smooth and nice So much fun to play with friends Best Survival shooter ever I would recommend it to every shooter fan and every survival fan Joy to play and best devolepers that keep the game fresh with new stuff like weopons cars maps etvBEST GAME 2017 BY FAR
Game went to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  after the  10  releaseInstead of improving gameplay and fixing bugs bluehole decided that they had to milk the game before everyone notices that they don t care anymore Lootboxes managed to kill yet another gameSo yea   don t buy the game it s a waste of time and energy
Best GAme ever u guys should buy it right now
With the new style of game known as battle royale BlueHole has done a fine job of working or trying to work out all the kincks this game has For the avarge player this game will take some getting us used to but it all depends on the players playstyle This game allows for the passive and hyper aggressive types of players to thrive
best srvival game
fun game with good concept but poor optimization by the developers make the game unplayable
its a very good game i enjoy playing it
Are you gay  yesthen game for youJokes aside great game with friends if you dont take it so seriously all the time Edit So after I added more hours to this game I can say this for sureThis game is a love hate relationshipYou will hate itUntill you see that Winner Winner Chicken Dinner screenThen you will be happy for like 2 hoursThen back to hating it getting constantly killedAm I still recommending it Hell Yeah what do you think im gay playing fortnite  miss me with that gay LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
No overall complaints other than poor performance on a mid spec PC The game it self is fun to play and I always find my self going back to play
spent so much time playing this game amasing with friends  D
Remove the damn blur and DoF you added to the game
veri nice
One shot one kill
The game still crashes like its the test serverm16 is still the best gun in the gameThe chinese still run the serversHitreg is still in the dumpsterMelee weapons are still a jokeBut it finaly gets the FPS it should have always hadPlayerunkowns Battlegrounds 10
The game looks very nice But the thing is not only for me for others also It says I need to confirmaccept the terms when I start pubg But I can t scrool and click on the accpet button So I can t play the game    Can anyone help me 
It s kind of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  But if you team kill enough people it makes you feel better about your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  personality and lame jokes Check out my youtube videos for proofI give the game 4 out of 3 not recommended

Gr8 game 88 m8
Addicting game
Worth itso fun play with a friends
i love this game 3
Playing with your friends squad is the best experience in this gameso fun and enjoyable
FunFunFun
 Overrated 
AWESOME GAME  I ENJOYED IT I HOPE THEY FIX RANDOM CRASHES BUT THAT IS ONLY SERVERSIDE I GUESS MAD PROPS
the devs of this game are a bunch of crybabies
Used to be better in EA now shooting is absolutely crap uncontrollable recoil at any distance even with all attachmentsAlso first person perspective is a colossal failure because of the head bobbing and how guns are being shown
You guys need a dedicated server for indiantoo many chinese users hogging on all of asian servers
Just a casual fun game to play  
Recomended game for solo or team playerWin WIn Chicken Dinner
The most fun i ve had with friends since old school Battlefield 1942
very nice did very well
Danny approves
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing awful game please dont buy  only reason to stay around is the item has values but game still awful
 Something Special It may seem easy or trendy to hate on PUBG but this game really is an experience unlike anything i ve ever playedFrom early March I have enjoyed being apart of the journey that was PUBG  So many great features have been added to this 
Its ok
It Would be perfect for us in middle east to play in some close serverswhy don t you try to make an arab server such as Dubai server  in CS GO and Dota 2 there is dubai server so it wouldn t be that hard to make it for us and about the game  its full of  nice people but in SEA server its f  king full of campers
If whatever Playerunknown said and promised during H3 s Podcast will be fulfilled by the devs I could rate this game 9510Yeah there are some issues about rubberbandinglags optimisation also hackers However if you watch the update progress from April 2017 you can clearly see that dev actually put efforts on making this game great Compare this game to other massively multiplayer survival games like DayZ and you will say  holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Remember that making and developing a game is not easy I can say that this game is worth more than its current priceDespite of the positive review there is still 1 negative side of this game Normal people  non streamer can t make their own custom games This shows that devs still favor streamers over us  plebs Hopefully custom games will be available for all players There is also another suggestion which I could give Since modding is not possible I hope that PUBG gives us the opportunity to use their own PCserver to host gamescustom games  so similar to CSGOOverall I give this game a rating of 8010Update The fact that map selection and language selection for random squad isn t implemented yet is quite disappointing Days ago I played with my brother and I had a bug where he can t revive me after being disconnected from the game This bug happens after the game has been updated This is showing lack of commitment from PUBG company They had the option to update test server so that people can test it before implementing the gameThe rating goes down to 65
Intresting very intresting              hmmmmmmmmmmmmm                                                                                                                                            i think your pc wont handle this gamehmmmm                                                     hackerz everywhre hmmmmmmm
This is one of the best game i have ever playedthere is always something to do and you just have to try and winone problem i found with the game is that there are a lot of bugs and glitchs but most of them should be fixed by full realease and one more thing is that there is a couple of hackers that you will somethimes come across but overwall this is a good game
The best battle royale game
 Server s are too busy  On launch guess I m too busy for their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  unpolished game then
Best game to play with squad
dont buy this  game ok  cuz it very fun and not optimizzzzzed game ok
Good game  Needs more optimisationSpeaking of my Pc  It eats my GTX TITAN X like an obese guy humping a thin girl
Very interesting game
fake news count down fake
why my BP   
Really good game the graphics are good
made 360 s with cars 1110 would play again
NOT JUST A GAME THIS IS CHEAT ROYALE
Easy to understand game concept yet hard to master all the nuances of the game Get your friends together and drop in for some of the most intense squad action you will ever have outside of an actual gunfight
Run and scavenge loot for 35 min get shot by some camping scumbag perking on an angle great game would recommend 57
It does look like sh t and plays about the same as it is very poorly optimized and seemingly on all fronts Uninstalled I d recommend either waiting for a big sale or spending your money elsewhere
Not recommended for potato pc s6510 EDIT Since update 10 I get 35 40 fpsnow i get 60 706610dont buypls alsoREGION LOCK CHINA
I don t get WHY people like this game It s pretty generic for a shooter the graphics are poor at best and it s pretty repetitive at its core It feels like  and started off as a mod for a game not worth being treated as its own stand alone game
zevkli bir oyun heleki arkadalarnz varsa almanz tavsiye ederim yaknda optimizasyon sorunlarda zlecektir
I think its a grate game that came in the right time 
Was fun until chinese hackers played the game
Need to be more optimizebut it is a good game
Honestly should be a free to play Instead its a pay to play with more to buy in game Looks like a game that came out 10 years ago performs like a game that came out this yearFun but limited content
if i cant even play the game because the servers are overloaded why shouldnt i be given a refund thats so stupid i didn t pay to wait to be able to play

It is the best multiplayer FPS since CS Quite a lot of fun but must be played in a squad with your friends to realise it s full potential Playing with Randoms is exactly that random It s not without it s glitches and lag rears it s ugly head quite a fair bit but when it s all going well it s excellentSkill cieling is extremelt high so expect at least 80 100 hours of play before really getting into itAs for the negative feedback this game gets yes there are some crashes and bugs this was after all early access It crashes you restart the game and continue where you left off To be honest I did not have many issues with crashing Make sure you have a beefy PC to handle it and it s quite fine Even with the issues it was quite playable and once you get past the millenial  must have it now or else  attitude it truly is an awesome game for 29 I ve purchased games three times this price to not even play 10 hrs
Best game I have ever played Update It wasNew map is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing terribleNew update is terrible The new contrast is terrible game looks like everything is goldenBullet leading is stupid it was realistic now you have to shoot way in front of people even with 556 ammo8x is now terrible Still sucks keeps getting worse terrible update these developers have to be stupid you dont change something that isn t broke and thats exactly what they didCrazy desyncPeople coming from other servers AS in NA and kill you through walls with tons of lag and take advantage of the desync Im adding on to this as I play the new updateYou cannot choose bettween maps and my squad and I do not want to play the new mapJust got shot through the wall this dude was looking at a wall in the harry potter tower im looking straight at it and I don t see him i watch the kill cam Guess what im not surprised because everytime i die It s the same LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  A day ago before the update I wrote how the game was good now read my review from my favorite game to my least favorite I have more fun killing people on Cod nowEverytime you get shot in the citys now on the new map it takes way to long to spot people out and as soon as you spot them out there like peaking through the smallest crack This game promotes campers im about to switch to fortnite I have defened this game way too longGernades kill you from like 10 feet away DON T CHANGE IF ITS NOT BROKENvm this game is fine I was just playing terribly at the time
This is fantastic game it makes you think after about 400 hours on the game I still find new and surprising things there are still things that I could improve at with 350 hours on the first map I can confidently say that there are many places that I haven t been too many things I haven t tried and so many things that keep bringing me back to it Recently I have seen a large amount of chinese players on the american servers which is quite frustrating especially considering that many of the cheaters in this game are from china There are also many bugs that occur when driving especially on the new map there are many times my car will get hitched on something that isn t there There are many hackers ruining the game right now but from my understanding they just sent out a pretty big ban wave which is nice to seeOverall this game has many fantastic experiences and moments that I ll remember for a long time I recommend this to everyone that has a decent computer  the experience is not great on a low grade desktop The few things I d like to see happen to this game is that they continue to support it  add more content  and build upon it they region lock china specifically and they continue to optimize and fix the game s bugs
gud game many campers
 China numba huan  everytime I start a game1010 would experience everyday
best battle royale game i had ever played great game i recommend to own this gameplay n enjoy
Bu oyunun anasnn amnkoyayim bi oyun bu kadar bok edilebilirdi aptal orospu evlatlar m16la bile 2 mermi atinca karakter 360 dnyor tepmeden dolay tsl game ktiabn sikeyim senin direk uninstall elimde olsa iade ederdim aptal orospu evlatlar
Great GameThis game has a great idea and just a great overall formula The guns and attachments are familiar to CoD and stuff and that makes this game feel really familiar to people who play FPSs Of course the game is Early Access so there are some major issues A somewhat beefy computer is recommended I have a fairly expensive build with the acception of my R9 380 GPU Though my GPU isn t great I would expect to get AT LEAST above 50 or so fps  But I know they are trying to address these issues The game overall feels kinda clunky and choppy but that should come with better optimization and so on Despite optimization issues I think the game is fantastic Great to play with friends Never too much salt because there will always be a next game Love the game Best game I ve played in a while
Everyone knows what this game is so don t hate the awesomeness  Just come in sit down and make a camp
I do not recommend this game to friends and am changing my review after my increasing frustration with hackers in this game There is still an excess of hackers playing on the servers and I did not realize this until I used the replay feature for the first time to look over games I thought contained suspicious players I have on average played with a player using aiming cheats at least 14 of my games in these past few weeks I can not believe that this is still a problem with PUBG after the initial surge of hackers months ago as it undermines the competitive nature of the game and one would think with the massive amount of money Bluehole makes that they would be able to create software that isn t so susceptible to cheaters Wrong instead you watch killcams of players snap aiming onto your head and you see 10 20 players left alive when the match still contain 50 players Absolutely dissapointed with the inability for this company to right these throwaway account hackers
awesome game  3
Game has turned to sh   Multiple hackers in almost every game extreme rubberbanding issues and hasn t been optimized to date
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing love this game Buy it you will too
1  Change your minimum system requirementsis it possible to play with minimum requirement  answer is NO2  Make recommended stystem requirementsIt is like i5 16gb and gtx 1060And make a way to display actual ingame realtime network ping and FPSDon t cheat ppl who want to play with minimum requirementsbut i will still recommend this game bcuz i love itEdit  Plz ban LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in hackers in SEA regionWas recommended but no more for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hackersalways with aim hack noobs
wtf Please open the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing new uptate so we can play I don t understad the problem
Garbo gameo
Top 10 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iest anime games of all time and this game is in itTons of bugs bad optimization bullets feel heavily reliant on RNG to land shots when not aimed down Devs update the game at an abysmally slow rate when it comes to fixing big issues
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  
awfully fun
Server is trashDc way too often
i love this game i m recommanded to buy this game  
its f u n
SO MANY CHEATERS LOL
Are they seriously launching this game in the state it is in  Wow Don t buy unless you like fighting hackers
fun to play and very serious when playing with a full squad
It is the best multiplayer game ever played although its sometimes it s very glitchy cause it s in development hope it will get fix update so far I love this game and I highly recommend to play with your friendsbestmultiplayergameoftheyear
i like it so much but pls remove the foggy weathers
Still better than H1Z1
It s good when you don t have a sore loser for a teammate  coughs  autotu  who 
I cannot play On my Gaming Computer it says  My Proccesor is for the latest Version of windows when I have Windows 7 and thats it s a  Security Issue  When waiting this out a error says that MSVCP140dil is missing even thought its in the game file and I have it I really hate this because I want to play the full expirence Not the laggy low resolution expirenceAnd I am not getting rid of my Windows 7
Really fun game especially when you team up with your buddies The game has a lot of good and bad points to it For the good  1 100 person multiplayer2 great graphics  as long as you got the GPU for it3 very competitive4 lots of guns5 weapon customization6 vehiclesetcfor BAD 1 CHINA  CHINA CHINA2 still has bugs3 only two maps4 hackers  though not as many since last update5 can be repetitive6 CHINA CHINA CHINABut overall I have to say this is a really good game and worth the money If you lucky with the crates you can pull stuff thats worth a little bit of steam cash or sell on OPSkins
This game is amazing regardless of its simplicity
At the time of writing this I have 44 hours in this  However I feel that I have enought expirence in the game to write this  This is the best Battle Royal game on the market  The gunplay is the best part of the game  I would compare it to Counter Strike  Each weapon has a unique spray pattern and there are multiple ways to aim  Also the design of the map is really good  The only down sides for the game I can really find are that it is terribly optimised and there is only one map  There is about to be a second map for the game but I belive there should be at least 3 maps  Hopefully there will be more maps in the future  Overall I would rate this game a 710  The gunplay is great but the game runs really bad and there is only one map at the moment  It would be a 910 if they could get the game to run better and add another mapEDIT  they optimized the game a lot more
Best game for battle royal everTruly a fun game to play and compete in Most poeple crying about it would be better suited for Halo or Call of Duty
Great game i cannot seem to find the words to describe this games Ive been gaming since i was a kid and everytime i got a new game i would flip them right away with out any challenge This game is very challenging due to the fact of its close realism to weapon usage and a shrinking open world play Love it
best game ever  only 1 time i found a cheater 
sup
AmazingBig potential
Good Game   If cheats are stopped it would be great
Game bery laggy doesnt run good on PC people from china play on NA servers with 333 ping
If you like sax this game is for you beacuse you will always get fooked in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  when you least expect it
if you looking for a reason to change a new pc play this game as it ll eff your current mid end pc up so bad
good
1010 game will leave you triggered and wanting to play more  Dont Jump Out Of A Moving Car
A lot of glitches But this game so funny
The game doesnt work
good game the graphic are alright the gameplay is great but there are bugs that need to be fixed and it crashes often might just be my pc i still recommend this game
Mess and developers are doing a pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor job
pay to win
All in all a solid game with a high learning curve
Guys I know its kind of hard to spend some time collecting resources but believe me this game is also interesting
I honestly don t know why theres so many negative reviews This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing awesome and fun to play with friends Sure for some people it might be difficult to run but they should honestly check the recommended system requirements before they purchase this I highly recommend this game
PUBG is like a sculpture made of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  No matter how you decorate it it is still a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Good game  NO
An exceptional game indeed If played with friends its just so much having fun
Good game  y
9 minutes That s how long I played it
There s a learning curve a long one there s hype for the game but it s not for everyone it s more fun with a squad than alone
Right now the game is horrible Somehow bullet damage and velocity seems to vary based on the player and game Even with the same armor and health the game somehow seems to favor one player over the other to the point where you can see that your guns kill in 6 shots while the same gun can kill you in 1 bodyshot full health I don t know how The game seems like it just flips a coin to whoever is favored This game is fun Only when the game favors you
Very tired of gathering equipment and armor for 10 minutes and then being shot by some CHEATER  This game is filled with people who bought cheat codes and need to feel betther about themselves 7 out of every 10 deaths seems to come from a cheater  Love the aspect of the game but fed up with PC online gaming because of the people who buy cheats and the companies who can t or won t stop them

 Esports ready 1010 pre alpha geame   IGN

i dont even have this game lol
This game is amazing that satifying feel of killing someone sooooo good
This game would be LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  without the gargantuan playerbase the devs are lucky hacks
Great game frequent updates
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS was the game each one of its 25861954 players desperately needed for as long as no one had made it  Thanks Tim Rogers for that oneIt is quite possibly one of the best gaming experiences you will ever have so long as you are willing to throw yourself to its demands in your harrowing quest for yet another piece of poultry to eat at nightIf you can stomach the optimization problems that the game is still working out  which are admittedly very close to fixed in the Test Servers and as such can be expected to be smoothed over quite well for the 10 launch as well as the fact that this game is less of a run and gun fest and more of a slow burn of tension then you ll have a great timeThink of it this way  every round of PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a horror game and the monsters are each of its other 99 participantsYou too are the monster
Pubg is by far the best survival game U can solo duo and squads of 4 team players You start off by parachuting into the island and gathering equipment Eliminating any enemies that you counter Trying to reach the spot when your the last survival player on the island You get rewarded with alot of Battle Points Battle Points   The battle points that you gain from a game depends on what your playing If your in a solo game then your recieving more points than you would in duo and squad games Squads   If your teaming with friends or online friends into a Q for pubg Team communications is key As I reviewed with R6S and CS GO Team communication and making sure you get the callouts is the most important thing ever If you have a teamate getting shot at and there not giving the call out then your not able to assist him Overall this is a wonderful game to get if your into survival games Make sure you also have friends that will or already have this game As it will get boring playing by yourself after a whileI do recommend people to get this game  D
this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  legitness
Really liked the idea and all but this is not a pick up and play game on any computer you really need a good pc to play at an enjoyable rate I suggest fortnite if you dont fit your standards of FPS or quality
My idea may be controversial but after months of playing Fortnite this is something that I can say is ten times better It feels like there is more action going on and the game does a good job at making you feel like you are in the center of the action 810 as the optimization for this game could be heavily improved Hopefully it will be in 10
This game has a very interesting gameplay and style to it I recommend this to someone if they were into battle royale games
This is pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is a piece of garbage that is not even worth the money If not for the fact that my friends play it i would ve deleted it a long time ago It is filled with bugs ranging from vehicles that flip out of nowhere to sudden game crashes that will kill you Calling it E Sport ready is like calling a bobbycar a full fledged racing car Instead of fixing any of the bugs the studio carry s on doing new bugged content This starts at loot crates wich nowadays even have skins in em to emotes that are completely useless They are even creating new maps which are mostly bugged and you can t even decide wich map you want to play because they seem to not have any idea on how to make a button with a map select They then say it is to prevent player drops on the most played game on steam If you are willing to buy uncompleted games than go with another game where the developer actually cares about how to make the game better instead of doing things that are completely useless and only bug the game more like event modes wich do not improve the game quality in the slightest
The game crashes way too often and I can t even start the game while I send the crash report And then when you have  finally reconnected you die to the Zone   
graphics like dayz and 40fps also game gets very repetitive and boring after 1h                                                                                                               Edit  Now all of this have been fixed and game is   1Very in depth 2More you play more fun it gets3Most importantly now can run high graphics 110fps even potatoes can run too4Now its even better than fortnite
Sure it has it quirks but overall a great game
so many chinese playersCHINAH NUMBAH 1
Good early game Hope they fix all issues cos there are lots
Let s start at the top  in PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds 90 to 100 players parachute from a cargo plane on to one of two islands   either temperate Erangel which has been in the game since its early access launch or the desert Miramar which is new Once on the ground these players clad only in whatever rags that loot chests have granted them raid abandoned buildings for weapons and scramble to kill each other while avoiding a vast forcefield that slowly closes in on a narrow area of a map Die and you are kicked back to the title screen  survive and er you won That s it Battlegrounds can be played solo or with a team in first or third person but this weaponised form of hide and seek is what it amounts toThis formula has made Battlegrounds one of the biggest games in the world with a seemingly universal appeal  it is both the game that boosted Steam s presence in China and the game that my friends who play one game every five years are playing It s a truth apparently unacknowledged that what the world really wanted was paintball on demand and the rewards for the first game to successfully render this experience outside of ArmA mods and H1Z1 spinoffs are apparently limitlessBattlegrounds is not on the surface a particularly elegant game Its strengths are in scale not detail and it has not quite risen above the sterility shared by most games with military sims in their DNA There are vague gestures at this being some sort of edgy TV show a flame motif logo that looks like a bad tattoo and a cast of appallingly dressed mute weirdos Theme and atmosphere don t matter much here however because these things are provided by the scenario itself and crucially by your friendsTo get straight to the heart of it PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is successful both as a game and as a business proposition because it is fundamentally social This unfenced form of shooter where it is fully possible to go half an hour without seeing an opponent or firing a gun is an ideal place to spend time with people a shared survival story that regenerates itself every time you load into a new game Your successes and failures lucky weapon finds long range kills and moments of vehicular bravado mean more because other people see them and because they contribute to the feeling that maybe   just maybe   this run will be the one where you finally make it to the endYour imagination does a substantial amount of the heavy lifting here At any given time the excitement of a Battlegrounds match is bound up in your sense of what might happen rather than what eventually does After all this is a game where only one player or one team walks away feeling one hundred percent good about what just happened  and yet somehow despite the most consistent experience of Battlegrounds being failure it retains its appeal Hell it s often fun to fail  my favourite matches are frequently the ones where I m forced to survive in the bushes with a crossbow rather than the ones where the first house I raid contains a lovely UMP submachine gun with all the trimmingsYour imagination does a substantial amount of the heavy lifting here At any given time the excitement of a Battlegrounds match is bound up in your sense of what might happen rather than what eventually does After all this is a game where only one player or one team walks away feeling one hundred percent good about what just happened  and yet somehow despite the most consistent experience of Battlegrounds being failure it retains its appeal Hell it s often fun to fail  my favourite matches are frequently the ones where I m forced to survive in the bushes with a crossbow rather than the ones where the first house I raid contains a lovely UMP submachine gun with all the trimmings
fart you
Money grabbing dev s are sad bois because they aren t number 1 in a currently popular genre So they are looking to sue companies for stupid reasons If you don t have this game already don t support this stupidity
No trade no level 3 helmet
Almost Perfect  need some work sure  but it dfntly fkin rocks   
best game ever 
 BEYONDER get PUBG it s soooo much better than the other games that came before it  Buys PUBG It s EXACTLY what i though it would be It s the exact DayZ Rust H1Z1 type battle royale game i figured it would be410
This game is fun with friends but with
Pretty good game plus i played the test version  10 it s very much more stable and playable than this version at the moment and it releasing in 16 hours makes me happier Well done
not bad good
I d rather sell my pc than play this trash again  
For too many cheaters
good game very overrated tho
best game but they need to work on optimization
GO PLAY PUBG BOYZZZZZZZZZZ
ROBLOX is better than this game
Its gay and freaking FUN  D
I suck but it s fun
FIX YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SERVERS YOU CUNTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hate it but love it
spent half the time trying to connect to lobby
Just trash
TRASH I CAN T PLAY IT ON MY GLORIOUS PC WTF IT S LAGGING WTF INTEL PENTIUM SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS GAME SINGLE HANDEDLY WHAT ARE THESE IDIOTS OVER AT BLUEBALLS DOING THEY SHOULD OPTIMIZE THIS PIECE OF POOP EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED
After 400 hours played i can finally review this gamePROS  Game was initially amazing mostly because of its potential unique gameplay and all And i can say it WAS amazing because altough it was buggy as hell it was EARLY ACCESS and alot of work in front of us Overall i enjoyed this game the best i couldCONS  Now take everything i said and play this buggy and unfinished game as a FULL RELEASE Not sure when but they chose the money way and hurry up releases that weren t ready instead of making the game as it shouldI will avoid the game until i m sure its a FINISHED GAME and one that doesn t crash and desync like a incomplete game
Me hacker everywhere do something blueholeBluehole ok i m just improved miramar Me you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 4sshole
awsome game can be very frustrating at times with bugs and lag etc but i still enjoy it waiting for the 10 release which should be a massive improvement
Could use some more optimisation but very good game many profit
What can I sayPub LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing G A great and intense game if you are into team tactical play or if you prefer to go the big LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lone wolf You do get the occasional hacker or sketchy LOVE LOVE LOVE  deaths but for me they are few and far between The server lag will make you want to break your screen but it has come a long way from before Sucks they went money hungry for cosmetic items but i still dish out the bucks because the game really is that good But for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  sake mute all chat before you hop into the plane or you will loose all your damn brain cells Now excuse me time for my chicken dinner
I enjoyed this game a ton when it was the new hotness But it is just outclassed by fortnite now I find myself wanting to hop back into fortnite more instead of PUBG every few weeks I drops pubg for a few rounds and think to myself why am I doing this when it runs at a lowe FPS even on a 1070 ti compared to fortnite
Good and fun game But kinda annoying when u get killed by a camper after running for 20 minutes without seeing anyone  p
Bought this game from the launch hated it from the launch because of potential but so many issues but it is what it is this game is making progress full release in 7 month INCREDIBLE tested 10 and it s gucci
No two games will ever be the same Hours of new gameplay Would recommend playing it with friends as it can get a little boring when playing solo all the time
If you like broken buggy and unoptimized messes of a game which plays more like a slot machine than a game and every match is over with you shotting where the f  k did he shoot me from then this games for you
Kinf of gay tbh
GAEM KEEPS CRASHING AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD FIX A DAY AFTER AND HERE I AM 1 WEEK AFTER STILL CRASHING
the game is amazing and you are always on the edge of your seat people say about how free items became paid but if you ask me it dosent matter obviously i would like to run around in a trench coat and gas mask and even if you dont have these items you can find it on the mapbut in thge end it can only go two ways either you lose or you get that tasty chicken dinner1010  IGN would hide again
i like the hype where everyone plays this game seriously
gg nice game
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDSOkay so im gonna take some time to review this amazing game I have played PUBG for about 200 hours right now and i havent tired yet Its a online first person or third person action game Its very good that you can choose to play third or first person in my opinion Its a fun game to play with your friends since you can play duo or squad but you can also play as solo  You are supposed to find loot around on a deserted island Its like the hunger games movies There is 100 persons from the begining and you are supposed to be the last one standing Its a circle that make damage on you if you are outside it and its getting smaller and smaller In the end the last standing guys meet each other in the small circle then its only one guy that survives Well to talk about the game it self i would describe it as a very good and fun game but since its a early acess game there is a lot of bugs But what i think is that the creators of the game could lay some more time on it i mean new weapons and new maps since theres only one map right now But il guess there is coming new stuff to the game pretty soon I would say pubg is the best battle royale game out there better than h1z1 king of the kill If you rattle over if its worth to buy it i would say YES in my opinion its definitely worth 30 I give this amazing game a 910
connecting problems takes so long to load after every match can t join severs  so i have to restart the game blueballs entertainment please fix your game i thought after the 10 launch pubg will be better but no not worth the money after million of years
need to optimize the sytem requirement
Amazing gameplay  Salty people but that s the fun  
This game is an amazing battle royale  and I highly recommend this gamebut it has awful optimization but if you can pass that you can have alot of fun the fact of having 100 people in a lobby and  trying to survive is a very very nice concept
My favorite game at the moment the graphics look great the game runs great and the game is so fun when you do duos or squads and you feel so good when you get that chicken dinner MAANNNNN
Bad game baught it once and refunded after 3 games lagy as hell and pretty dead
great game great staff gg
I LOVE THIS GAME  People complaining are some greedy mofos  The game is in EARLY ACCESS  It s normal to have some bugs and lacks of optimisation I play on low setting at 60 70fps  with some drop of course with a freakin laptop with 8gb of ram and a 970m If lag is too much for you may be your PC is complete crap      So basically if you re not ready to play an  incomplete  game just wait for its complete release and pay 70   Otherwise pay 35 right now and enjoy Thumbs up to the devs who are constantly improving the game 
SUCCESSFULLY SENT INVITE MESSAGES unintelligible russian 
Nothing is being done about the cheaters nothing Do not buy until it has been fixed
Absolutes Suchtpotenzial
i love playing the game with my friends the reason it gets a bad review long range headshot on me and my team 2 secs apart from hackers the game has been out for a while also while we do manage to do fairly well most of the times we have been killed has been to hackers and a few normal playersit just ruins the game when you fake going around a corner and they shoot anticipating the shot or they shoot at you perfectly when you know they cant see you its just to obvious im not sure how they are still able to hack like this in a game that was fun but now im gonna move on
I paid 36 Canadian for this game I have been selling crates for 9 months and have made that amount twice over Buy a crate or two a week and sell it on the marketplace I make less than 10 a month but it paid for itself and for tons of Steam games on sale Like Rainbow 6  Siege Fable  The Lost Chapters Tannenberg Rising Storm  Vietnam Spelunky and Euro Truck Simulator
Most Def needs optimization and a great big cyber wall that separates servers to the players region respectivelyAlso bring forth the destruction of Julian etcetera etcetera
Can t wait for 10
Best Game ever
At the current state don t botherI put in my time I played with friends and enjoyed some of it However problem after problem server lag after server lag at some point you ll say  enough  as well Among cheaters desync and an overall clunky game I just don t understand the rabid cult behind this game Was it because it was the  first   BR  I m not telling you to try the various free alternatives to this game I m saying this game isn t worth the 30 I spent on it even though the amount is decently pricedI m also not saying I ve given up worst game 010 I ll gladly come back when it s a better game But with only monthly patches optimization few and far between that probably won t happen soon 410
Very addictive I hope the full launch of this game will be more exciting than ever
I can easily reccomend this game BUT i do have a warning or twoThe movement cars and hit detection CAN be buggy as hell so its a hit or miss kind of situation at the moment when it comes to those things but the good of the game EASILY out weighs the bad If you like FPS s that you can play to your style whether it be fast paced running and gunning or laid back sniping or the latter PUBG is the solution
You need a super computer to run this game I have a gtx1070 and the buildings wont even load What a waste of money Having an SSD may help out a lot I am really disapointed in this purchase it is really too bad
Worst Game
The pure uncut cocaine 
The game is absolute fun to play however there are some interface problems I would like to see addressed like comparing your friends stats to yourself as well as adding people through the game client as friends if there was an enjoyable  random squad match up Also I am tired of having to reselect what game mode I want after each game
games LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing trash lmao dont recommend don t buy this game worst game ever made  1010 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE  cheek game
awesome
CrackPureCleanCrack
The game you will love to hate Challenging and fun for both you and your PC
The game is like 9 months old shock horror it s not fully optimized and it s a bit buggy Devs have updated regularly with changes that are noticeable and the fact that they have stuck to the plan of release in 2017 is so refreshing compared to the likes of DayZ Solid game for the most part amazing experience bring some friends and prepare to get salty as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Good game lots of cheaters
PUBG is my favorite LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game to play It is full of issues and I mean FULL of em  The servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   rubberbanding is a huge problem Your average player gets 20 frames The maps need a lot of work with many areas being glitched out and can easily result in ending your run The game crashes every other match The community is pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you ve got kids screeching into the mic and people just arguing over stupid things in the chat Hackers aren t as prominent as they used to be but they still existBUT even with all these game breaking flaws I still immensely enjoy this game It is fun to play both solo and with friends  recommended The game feels rewarding when you win YOU survived till the end it was your tactics your skill that led you there The gunplay is satisfying and the driving machanics aren t too bad either It s addicting to do  just one more match  It s a horribly fun game It s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but it s MY FAVORITE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE And to address many of the negative reviews that you will see   they are complaining about the loot boxes and  microtransactions  The loot boxes are bought with IN GAME currency that you get by PLAYING THE GAME The items you get are PURELY AESTHETIC They don t affect gameplay and many of them you can pickup and wear through the course of a match The only microtransactions that occured were for cosmetic items and funded the Gamescon Invotational prize pool They were completly optional and the regular crates still dropped I can t understand why people are so madOverall PUBG is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game that has great potential and is definetly going somewhere With the official release just around the corner I see performance imporvements and cool features in abundance If you are looking for a game that you and your friends will have fun in this is a great option I plan to clock in many more hours into the game  ps you can also totally make your money back on the game by selling crates
RIP pub g once a good and now not thanks for the  was so good update buttttttt you kinda LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed it by makein us not be able to trade to person to person
I m probably better than 99  of players Makes me feel awesome
Before I give my review I wanna WARN everyone that you need a God Like computer to run this game smoothly My 40Ghz 8Gb RAM R7770 DDR5 began it with nothing more than 10fps You need a R7850 to run it on VERY LOWSo first of all the game is entertaining don t get me wrong but supposedly it is on Early Access I say supposedly because it s half a year which it has been  released  the developers had plenty of time to fix the dozens of glitches andor give the game a decent optimization setting they even created a new map meanwhile Given the price and its current status it is not worth your investment Watch your favorite streamers play it wait until it s fully released for a real review and decent gameplay but I repeat it is NOT worth it
     LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 1            470                   
By the situation on test servers it should be very well optimized when the 10 gets out   Very fun game to play with friends or alone
dis gamz izz bery lit
Even with the lag cheaters and poor servers this game still rocks The replayability is insane
Ruined it might as well just call the new map  camping desert snipers  because that s the only people who can play it now
ya know this game is really fun but too inconsistent with lagging on the test server i can barely get it up half the time  i know it s a test but still it crashes every other LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing time i even open the app and when i finally manage to find a game i ll rubber band if there are more than 3 people in the area i swear to god
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing danky dank
still have crash in game but it is still fine need more work to fix and ban hackers
played it a few hours and must say its a good game some people in the review are saying the meet cheater almost everygame ive never encounterd a single cheater ever the game is good as i said but in some aspects it need updates but its worth buying it
FIX SOUND It s 2018 What the f    with stereo sound with lousy sens of direction    I died so many times coz I heard shots fired from opposite direction And optimise that damn thing Implement Vulkan API or we Battlefield 1 GTA5 has great graphics and big LOVE LOVE LOVE  maps but they doesn t lag like this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
keep crashing
Cheaters ruins everything
Stop the daily updates
They took all the fun things from survival games like DayZ and H1Z1 and took out all the boring parts to make a game that keeps you on your toes the entire match
Loved this game I loved that you had no tutorials and you just have to learn everything by yourself Well now there s plenty of videos on youtube explaining how to use every weapon It s a hard game with a lot of excitement when you re in a top 10 It s not perfect of course there s still server problems like lags that allowed your ennemy shoot you 1 or 2 times while you re behind a wall There s still cheaters but I found one rarely Very addictive and I will keep playing it and getting better Very funny when you play with your mates in squad And if you re solo queu you might fnd funny guys Rarely played with really salty guys Don t take it seriously and have fun
Hacker is everywhere  bluehole and BE still not working for fix game loopholes  Don t Buy this game  waste your money 
Great game apart from every single game being full of hackers
Game is absolutey awful  Optimization is garbage and the hackers are rampant  Every game you get into will have hackers  Good luck getting wins  Also they drastically reduce the amount of credits you get per gamewin to try and get people to buy more crates  210 dont buy
 As weve already mentioned a few times server stability is one of our top priorities Weve seen your feedback and our data analysis confirms that some players are having to deal with issues that disrupts their game experience Alongside other measures we will be implementing we are now also looking into implementing ping lock to help with server lag and other stability issues We are in the process of developing this feature and it will be tested in a single region at first We will keep you updated on our progress Direct quote from most recent test build patch notes yet every game I try to play on the test servers I either crash before I get in the game or I afk drop and IF that happens then at least 60  of the time I am stuck in the sitting position with very minimal control over my character So I appreciate the attempt at tryting to fix the servers however unfortunately for me the attempt was not good enough
Game is very good overall a few bugs but it s an early access game I m happy with it
i recommend the game but do friendly fire off because a lot of pepol will shut you if you got better loot
Honestly yes the game might have its issues but being able to super man someone to death just makes it all better Also the nerf to the crossbow was a low blow
I honestly don t see why people are getting so mad over this game s flaws It s still in early access and it s still in development Wait until the game is finished and then complain Other than that this game is funI guessSo many asians
i am forceclose wtf
One of the best games ever been realesed on steam keep the good work
Very good game but needs some balancing and performance upgrades I think you should buy this game if you like killing people and don t get mad about getting killed
Not a bad game even with its issues But you guys got to admit for a unfinished game like this its a tad bit overpricedEDIT  Okay game is better now Price is still gay
A game where speed limit signs can vertically impale your volkswagen bus and make it explodeGame mechanics 1010
Definitely one of the best games ever The game is great and in every update there is fixing lags and new thing now there is realesed new map in test server I think this game worth every  Big recommendation
I want my Boney back plz
Sick game performance needs to be worked on though with the rendering of the buildings and foliage
This is a fun game with friendsThats about it reallyIts the same game over and over with little to almost no excitementThe gameplay itself isn t 100  stableSince release it still uses the  early access  excuseIt has nothing unique to make it stand out from any other survival game with a arena modeIts a waste if you play 30mins a game just to lose 100 players  1  win change playing soloThere really is no point in winning as well You get nothing but coins that you get by just playing anywayFor the cost of this game there is too little contentNo trophy or achievements for the game so no real driving goal to play it anyway
Cheaters infested What fun 
Legit the best get shot by someone you never saw as soon as the game starts simulator I have ever booted up on my steam
Good game when it wants to actaully work and not bug out
fortnite pubg
very hard to get a chicken dinner
when the 95  of the community tells you exacitly what they want maybe you should listen to them Instead MICROTRANSACTIONS
Really good It is very hard to quit once you start playing This game can also be fully of rage
Refounded

PUBG is one of the best games i have played in a while all though this game has various problems its still is a exellent game If you do not have patiance then this game isnt for you Now time to get into the issues of the game this game is poorly optimized Any one with an i5 6700k and GTX 1050ti can run this game 60fps and higher on medium to low settings As of now I run the game at very low and dont even run the game on minimum requirements With that said you should pick up this game if you have the money and the PC to play it
Great Game value for moneyAfter 200 Hours just getting started  
I just bought this game   Installed it and got this error MSVCP140dll any one got solution                
it crashes evertime i depoly and doesn t follow the commads for the keyboard i end up dieing instanly as i spawn in
I played this game on my phone after being hardcore fortnite for a few months It really was a better experience at first so I bought the PC edition but there are definitely more cons than pros For instance the game simply does NOT run smooth Even with an 850m GEFORCE GTX graphics card I can only play this game on VERY LOW graphics and still only maintain 30 40 fps On top of the constant crashes and loading screens you get stuck at Another thing this game costs 30 off steam correct  You earn currensy in the game by playing rounds earning more currensy the better you do The only thing you can spend this currensy on  other than changing your character appearance for a ridiculous amount is to buy loot crates that contain clothing items Fun right  Wrong These crates then require you to BUY A KEY WITH REAL MONEY EACH KEY COSTS 250 SO YOU PLAY THE GAME TO EARN CREDITS TO GET CRATES TO SPEND MORE REAL MONEY JUST TOP OPEN THE CRATES YOU BOUGHT WITH YOUR IN GAME CURRENSY So I spent 30 on a game that is at BEST mediocre compared to other battle royales and the only way to open my 10 crates is to spend 25 real life dollars Absolutely ridiculous in my opinion After a few chicken dinners and countless game crashesruined games because of peoples play styles  camping in the corners of three story houses not making a single footstep while peaking at the staircase in third person my friends and I have made the switch to Ring of Elysium Ring of Elysium is currently only available in Thailand but you can find videos on how to download it in the States  Where I am Pubg is a disgrace and it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on its own customer base This game has so many issues I guarentee it s not worth buying Get Ring of Elysium or fortnite for free even if the graphics are not as great the games simply run SO much smoother and do not try to rob your wallet even after making 10 times their projected sales
can this game run smooth on gtx 1060 and i5 6500  on fights my fps is 25 30  all on low settings even screen scale 70  and resoliution on 1680x1050  Any help 
this is oe of the badest game ever made at least the badest battleroyal DONT BUY
Goodbye PUBG
game filled with hackers and these cheap LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE es arent doing anything about it
Best Game I Ever Try  y
Devs will NEVER region lock this game The thing is they want the hackers Why sell a normal player 1 copy of the game when you can ban a hacker who will re buy the game multiple times 
Very fun game that s different every playthrough
I dont understand why so many people are hating on this out of no where PUBG is a great game and id recommend it to anyone who likes survival and FPS
I just cant wait for more updates and more development of this gameAwesome game very exciting  Every kill makes me wanna kill more
Would be one of the greatest games ever but very laggy and glitchy just now  With great games comes good and bad players Some too goodCome play
waste of 30 dollars would not buy
I have rarely expierenced anything all the negative reviews complain about
How can a terrible game be so addicting 20hz tickrate terrible controls awful game mechanics frustrating camping centric gameplayYet it s a hilarious high adrenaline ride to that beautiful 1st place Chicken DinnerIf you can handle it s flaws I would highly recommend it just be prepared for frustration
BUY IT Is great LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on h1z1
Fun initailly but recent updates have ruined the loot system and shooting mechanics In addition to selling an incomplete game as a retail title on the xbox one this game has become a parody of itself
I played my two hours and refunded tho it was too big and every game took a huge amount of time let s don t talk about the almost every time u land u get a shity loot and someone with scar or M16 just busting u out I found it not very fun and veryyy long
Dont buy into the hype Servers are worse than a free2play game and developers have no idea what they are doing If I could get a refund I would
This isn t a clever or witty review that plays up the latest trends and memes the gaming community is playing up in this game this is just my experiences and caution against friends buyingI have played this game for over 30 hours now and had some great moments and some awful ones  In the end I cannot recommend a friend purchase this title for a few reasons I wont go on about being banned for being near a streamer as it has not happened to me or anyone I know However I am concerned about the developers actions in some of these questionable bans I wont complain about having games ruined by hackers as I have had a few questionable deaths but the lack of feedback the game gives on deaths makes it impossible for me to be clear if it was a hacker or the result of the jank and erratic server performancelag However I am concerned about the rising reports and videos of the ease of hacking this game I am not complaining about purchasable cosmetics providing better camouflage as the graphics in this game at any distance are poor at best  However I do find it concerning the developer broke a pledge to not sell cosmetics until after full release as there are many rough edges they should be fixing before making that cash grab A significant amount of jank still in the game with movement driving physics server performanceOverall I think this game can be fun to play AT TIMES  when jank and lag and poor optimization do not cause problems with friends and there is potential for a great game here but it is NOT a great game overall or even a good shooter at its core   once the EA jank loses its charm you are left with a game with many issues that have been given a pass by many people due to EA or the novelty of silly physics or the simple steamroll the popular sentiment became for this gameDue to this my biggest disappointment is that the developer has raked in TON of funds and has not fixed any of the above issues despite having the resources to do soIts cool if you like the game this is not an attack on anyone and their gaming preferences just my feelings noted down for any friends  or anyone else who cares to read
Literal garbageUpdate 12218 Even after they banned 100K cheaters i have encountered even more cheaters than before LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game and region lock chinaUpdate 13018 Game is still absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  garbage562018 So let me update the review for this horrible game The new update made the game somehow even worse With recoil being changed from something controllable and predictable for assault rifles to completely random at times Vehicles are just as bad as release absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT WHATSOEVER if anything they got WORSE Stupid cheating chinese everywhere I feel asthough the lag somehow got even worse than before with me hiding behind a building a whole 1 25 seconds before getting shot in the head by a guy i was looking at prior   Yes i timed it you stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE sIf you want to do your self a favor do not buy this game let it die and the developers die with it literallyIf you want to do a bigger favor buy it give it a negative review and never play itLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
from my early access I was disappointed Made 2 rounds felt static and wayyyyy unfinished Lack of textures modeling poor sounds physics etc One of them I killed my self getting out of my very slow moving car after 20 min spent without any encounter The round winner will be rushing equipment during the first minutes then camp and hope that the last stage will be on his ground Rinse repeatOverhyped and overrated are the 2 words that comes to mind I was refunded
i suck so bad
Xbox ports are downright atrocious I cant support these devs for pushing such a broken product Oh and the PC port runs like aids and all they did was make a new map GG Fortnite is way more appealing
Optimization is good so far Hopefully can improve some of the bugs So far so good Hope my best friend Liew Joon Hung can always play with me happily
Geliyor gnlmn efendisi
A lot of glitches consumes too much resources but the biggest minus of this game is tons of cheaters and the company is doing nothing about it
Safe to say LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  BROKE but i still love this game for some reason
Servers are now worse than they were when they released Constantly being shot around cornersEDIT  10 release yet still cant load in to the plane 1010
Goodgame but my laptop only runs it in 3 fps FeelsBadMan
I have more than 80 games and more than 1000h of gamerecord on DOTA2 Now my account has been compromised because of this game and I have a permanent VAC ban from PUBG This game ruins the account that I have been using since 2014
mad game would suggest it to anyone 
Hype train If you aren t one of the millions already suckered out of your 30 just save it and play Fortnite
The game is fun as hell Finally a good battle royal game Only complaint would be the performance The game will still need better optimizationvery recommended if u have lots of friend plays as squad
This game is saturated with an obscene amount of hackers
Great fun Incredible graphics and massive immersive maps The 2nd map has a level of detail that is just astounding BUY THIS GAME ALREADY
I like the game dont get me wrong but they need to optamize and stop seting unmeatable goles and the game basicle needs alot of work and shuld not be released this early
Simulator Death of the fall of
esports ready  10
Could be a great game but    Tons of desync lag   not acceptable for a shooter game type  Chinese everywhere on EU servers   don t speak english high pings and cheat a lot
In my opinion the best Battle Royale game out there many weapons and attachments realistic gunplay different vehicles big and nice maps fast matchmaking decent graphics
I really hate this game but it s fun Casual approved
The only problem I have with the game right now is when i spawn I start to stutter and the textures aren t full loaded and I dont get a good framerate other than that the game is awsome I recommend playing the test server because its better optimized and the game runs smooth I love the game but now the textures dont load fast enough on the bother servers can anybody help me fix this problem
PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS   positive 1 Graphics2 Big map  negative 1 cheaters2 toxic players3 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  players4 bugs5 lagg and crashes on hight end systems    like mine  6 cant connect to the servers7 people getting banned with no reason
If you enjoy Eternal Loading screens Random Crash To Desktops  And the slim chance you do get into a server getting killed by four hackers with zero recoil then this is the game for youFood for thought Devs dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing port a game to console if you cant even stabilize the PC version
This game is full of cmaping LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and hackers i say this so you dont spend 30 euros on the game and play a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Worst game ever Pls take it down and refund all my money and give me back my 4 kids back and the 3 wifes
Decent If the net code was a tab better and the armor system is dumb AF I shot you in the nose but hey I have a helmet on so lets damage that instead I mean game can be fun at times but far from realistic in which is what I was leaning more to but if its your style  its your style
I recomend you buying this if you like battle royale games  DIts really fun and i spent some hours at this game
closing skin trade system  nobody will open crates if you open 50x and get shit 01 dollar garbage still not optimised tho hope better battle royale game will be up soon  after 31 may 9 gb patch they said its more optimised but fps optimised 50 from 60 fps got less fps now lol even connection is laggy as hell thousands of mouse macro aim helper users even hackers around trying to survive like 20 minutes but dying to a hackers or macro users is not fun to experience
Wonderful game
2312eqw656365666654
Don t buy this game as of right now Its full of hackers and the developers are not doing anything about it You WILL meet a hacker 810 games you play btw reporting does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I would very much like a refund
Good definitely to my favorites but needs some optimizations
The game is good Sometimes the delay is so high that it can t be a normal game
good game play so good
Best game and thats why I refunded instantly after playing the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game  
I like how the negative reviews say how bad the game is and forget that it s early access I know you won t believe this but early access games aren t going to be perfect There are always glitches bugs hackers etc So give them a chance they ll fix all the poor optimization and get a good anti cheat then it will be a good game
This game has lots of fun but lack of optimizationeveryday i start the game it crashed at the start updon t know why this happenspreviously they released their  startup  crash repair patchbut after installing that patch the issue occurs more than befoream i the only one who encounter this issue and don t know when the game will leave early access till thwn i will not recommend this game to anyone
This is probably the worst game experience I ve ever had THe entire game is bad The mechanics are bad The concept is bad It s boring You walk around for 20mins doing nothing just finding random weapons lying in the middle of random rooms in uninhabited mini towns while being herded into the middle of a circle by a big blue electric wall that kills you When you finally see another player you engage in a few shots with them and it s game over for either you or them like 5050 chance if you are going to kill them or they kill you and once you die after taking one shot the whole game is over and you have to start again Repeat above over and over There s really no objective or progression or anything It s so boring
There are a lot of people crying about this game It is in early accesss for a reason so you knew what you were getting yourself into Overall I have played many shooters in my life but this game even with the bugs here and there  which is mostly crashing is the best one yet There is alot of skill needed to get those chicken dinners
When I first started playing this i had a lot of conneciton problems and stuff not loading in but now it works fine Good Game
Love the game but honestly this issue with all these hackers need to be delt with Its annoying to have your kd ruined do to people exploiting scripts
Super fun game its still Beta i would say but its a fun experince the shooting has improved the sound textures and aloot of other stuff as well I stayed away from it for along time because of the negative reviews but its super fun and getting better Hardly ever see hackers now not saying i saw alot to begin with probly 17  of games and they arnt invinsible In the end I would say its fun not worth 30 tho
Using hacker for streamer is just like using stims for atheletes It s unforgivable
eh its fun to play with friends
good game just need them to fix some bugs
20th december 10 im looking forward for more bug and glitch  D as i walk pass a stone and im able to stuck in the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stone s aura 
TLDR  It s a fun and simple battle royal that can easily be played with friendsIf you aren t keen on early access game and have zero tolerence for possible  and honestly rare glitches I d say pass But if you enjoy on the spot critical thinking a constantly changing battle and the rewarding feeling of knowing you are in fact the best than this is you re game So here are a few main points that are critical for knowing when thinking of owning this game are The map is big plain and simple Like most sandbox survivors it has scattered homesbuilding a handful of small towns and few large sites guarenteed to attract attention It can get annoying trying to stay in the combat zones at first but to be honest you can easily predict where they will be  hint  they are almost always within a mile of the flight path of the plane There are a small sample of vehicles  cars mortorcycles and boats if you need to get somewhere fast but mostly they just make lots of noiseThe weapon selection is admittedly lacking  a few identical pistols 2 shotguns around 10 assault weapons one sniper a terrible crossbow and a handful of basically useless melee weapons and can sometimes blend together in a grey blur It doesn t take long to discover them While there are attachments for most guns it doesn t really spice up the gameplay because are you really not going to add it anyways  And earning the in game currency  BP  takes an honestly too long commitment Without winning everygame it takes about 7 or 8 games to open the first loot box Then the price doubles and then it doubles again  god help meThe combat is exactly like any other mainstream shooter You can play in 1st or 3rd person you find gear and armor and shoot anyone who you find  It s killed or be killed  Hanzi The beginning of the matches can sometimes be quiet and feel like every other match but near 30 players left it begins to heat up At the final 10 I d say is the most fun part and seeing the words  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  makes it all worth whileAs far a glitchesbuggeneral issues I d have to say most of the complaints are exaggerated If you have optimal internet the suggested hardware and the mindset that this is a constantly updated early access game you will really have next to no issues I ve played on PC and even the recently released XBOX One version and have had literally zero issues In most cases with these beta games people get one lag spike and rush to the negative review button The only issue you may have is if the host of the game themselves leavesdisconnects but that s a salty player and can t be blamed on the game As for the common notion that  Guns are too hard to find and everyone else always gets good stuff  this should just be tuned out That is exactly what a friend of mine said his first game after he made the mistake of parachuting into a live firefight Then 1 hour later we were one of the last teams armed to the teeth and having a great time If you expect to be handed a SCAR L right off the bat go play Battlefield No one in the Hunger Games was armed at the start and everyone else starts empty handedIn conclusion I d say this game is a clean 710High stakes combatA large map with both wide open areas and stressful cityscapesA variety of ways to play loud and mean quiet and patient the hermit who never moves the team of gun toating killers etcEnjoyable solo or with 1 partner or 3Appealing gamestyle  sure it s been done but this is one of the only ones you don t have to gather resourses which is niceNew experiences and constantly learning to adapt and use your surroundings  this games has me always thinking tacticalIt s only in beta and more is sure to come from this promising team Can be frustrating at first if you die immedately  it does happen a lot at first leading to the  this game sucks  mindset Being killed without ever seeing who did it or from where is kind of just a  Well that s it don t let the door hit you on the way out  It can make the player feel as though it was all for nothing The players use any and all exploits possible  Constant reality breaking jumping teleporting into vehicles in a flash using pronecrouch to dodge bullets and the age old camp with you gun aimed at the door and it just makes you regret even trying to engage sometimes
1010 would lag againYou know the game s good when the australian servers are as good as a potato found on the moon and used for sharpening knivesDoesn t make sense I know but neither does the amount of cancer lag and bugs I encounter on the game
IF there were less hackers I would recommend this game
Step 1   Boot up the game and wait an eternity for it to startStep 2   Enter matchmaking and wait an eternity for it to startstep 3   Parachute from the plane and wait an eternity for the buildings to download in from the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  serverstep 4   After it eventually works loot some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for 20 minutesstep 5   Die instantly after seeing somebody and repeatNow you might think  Just get a better computer I m running a GTX 980 16gb RAM and an I5  This LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  should not be happening  The gameplay loop is boring anyway theres no progression other than leaderboards and seeing your skills improve and it does not have enough to justify the 30 pound price point
I just bought this game why keep auto cancel find match  
Chinese famous streamer  55kai  cheated repeatedly but Bulehole did nothing about it Hope this company still have concious
Ok game Needs more content  new map coming Gets boring after awhile Much better with 3 or 4 man squads Buy if you are looking for a good battle royale style game but something better in this genre will come out When it does PubG will die like the rest have But for now its one of the better in its class
fun game especially with friends but i did have a bug where it said failed to initialize steam
Do not get this game it is currently full of hackers the more updates that come out more hackers also do When i first got this game is was really fun was my favourite but now its horrid Do not get itThe new hud is good but nothing else and they decide to what  change the blue zone instead of fixing their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hacker problem i cant find fun in this anymore you should of region locked china because that was the only way to fix this Banning 100K hackers good effort but that is no where near the amount that is in this game you basically removed 5  of hackers in this game Fix it you really need to
Bluehole Chinese Official indulges Chinese famous game streamer  55kai  Lu Benwei with repeated cheating behaviors on Douyu Streaming Platform which makes an extremely immoral example for teenagers and all players and lovers of PUBGWe protest against Cheating and Official s ignoranceWe Need Justice and Fairness
one of the best br s of its time
Game looks like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  yet still runs horribly even on high end PCsWorst part is that even though they made hundreds of millions of  off of it they still wont fix itrip my 30
the gameplay was very unique I m looking forward they ll fix the performance issue Lastly the cheaters Ban their accounts they ruined the entire game given the fact that they paid for it
Great game despite the continuing server issues Previusly had huge problems with cheaters but it seems that this is largely gone I play 3 4 hours a day and rarely comes across a cheater anymore 810
Great game everybody go school
Why my account has been banned from you I did not use the plug in
new update new crash error game i cant open
tvtv
This game sucks after the last update This game is probbably dead soo that means that i dont reccomended  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
doesent work tryed everithing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing worthless game if i buy a game i thought a game of 30 dollars is gonna be good so no its not
a gigantic turd
Realy bad servers which cause desyncrhonisation in game  the lag the game was never balanced at its optimazation always new crushes bugs and issues that keeps on happening 2018 low rewarding hackes are still and issue and last I believe is the only game that with the official release instead of giving you more content they took away weather effects from the map and still after 4 months they are noway to be foundLast there are too many promises of new content etc and still NOTHING
the car glitches are nice
stay away you won t regret it As much good review you ve heard bout this game is just not worth it now
This game is an expensive piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is good but the owner is the worst I ever met A game anchor used the cheating tools Everyone can see it obviously  url https vqqcomxpagep051475q62khtml fromvsogou1 However this company ignores that truth just because he is a very big anchor in China Also the server of the game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is still early access and with all the success we re only halfway there Think about it
This game is fun as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Always updating Theres only 2 main issues  The community bugs and hackers One example is the community is always complaining about how theres microtransactions when its only cosmetic This game is also really buggy but its in early access so its to be expected But do be warned that these bugs are pretty extreme when they do happen ie  car sinks into the floorAnd finally you will find hackers every 20 games or so but you just die and start a new game so its whatever Games only last 30 minutes MAX anyways Other then that I HIGHLY recommend this game but only if you have a good computer because its not that optimized
trash game uninstalled
no matter what the kids who s perants won t let them play mature games sayPUBG is better than fortnite
So the game is good but the hackers are frequent and network lag as of late is ruining the game I have had 3 games in probably 10 that have been dced mid game if you re going to patch LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  every other damn night let people finish their games like Riot does don t force push them out of games 11 people left I had best position and gear and i spend 28 minutes getting no points because your servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  You re a long way from being ready for E sports
could not start after download   some crash   also crash when trying to send back info   and no I did not have anti virus and vpn running   turning them off did not help
not work
Gut game A battle royale that goes for realism instead of trying to make the game suitable for small kidsThe most enoyment i have gotten from 30 1010 would play more  
Best turn based rts game I ve ever played
GudGame
this game is the most over rated game ever
Very good game Would really recommend if you like getting shot from people behind you even though you walked from behind you Also if your teammates die before you it makes it super intense
too much hacker unchecked
Very fun game even more fun with friends One negative thing is the hackers
i loke this gejjm prity gut
Best game created and it will be much better after new map update
moist
Most fun game currently in the market I play with 3 friends and the fun and laughs are guaranteed And the new desert map is much better than the old one so this is only getting better I have only encountered cheaters 2 or 3 times in my 300 hours so that is not an issue as most people say Performance is excellent despite all the complaints Running at locked 1080p60fps with a ryzen 1600X and an HD 7950  11Ghz at custom settings  similar to medium the game looks almost identical to ultra except for shadows
I played this game for a small period of time before refunding it  Before I bought the game I saw alot of stories  even widely known news articles about the devs banning whoever the streamers want them to ban  A streamer gets rekt by another player 1v1  They cry to the devs and the devs permanently ban the player that killed them  Other than that when playing it I just can t understand why someone would say it s fun it takes a good 5 minutes to get to the ground after trying to start a match and when you get there you re instantly killed by another player that already has a gun somehow  I never got very far with it  Waiting to die simulator
Supper Dupper Lagging Game Ever

you know its a great game when it has all of these problems yet i find myself playing it every single chance i get for hours on end It is a multiplayer experience unlike any other
Very good gam
Still dominating fortnite
This game needs to be optimized So LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing laggy
The  Servers are too busy please try again later  boss is overpowered  Having played 50 hours of PUBG thus far I have to say that playing Ring of Elysium on servers located in Thailand feels more responsive than the NA servers for PUBG do  RoE is free I would recommend trying it instead of spending money on this  If you enjoy RoE then you can always buy PUBG in the future
I really apprieciate this game
This is where it all startedTHE FIRST 100 PLAYERS SURVIVE BATTLE ROYALE GAMEPERIOD
Every time i play a match its always a different outcome of how the game ends for me and the gameplay is realistic and adictive
It s a really good game imo and the last Test servers update  With Desert map and complete revamped UI bring my poor Phenom X4 to over 60FPS at 1080p very low almost all the time Also I would love to see a self reviveable knock off state but any kind of healings will take double the amounts of time needed normally  Self reviveable would be really helpful in SoloOne man squad
This game is terrable it has devs that do not take consideration in feed back its true fans give LIke people give feed back and blue hole just takes the memo and then wipes their       with it they re network is boarder line not working at all you network lag about every 30s and i have had games go so well with no lag at all then with my team gets into a fire fight BAMM hit with lag and i sit there either i get shot or my teammates sit there crawling at me screaming to revive them The LEGAL contrat your made to sign at the beginning means nothing to anyone at all saying that the  Battle eye launcher is watching you very keenly to make sure you re not hacking in anyway shape or form and that we have all rights to ban you forever if we catch you doing so  BUUUUUUUT the game files are so open and easly access that you might as well open the game for mods cause that 14 year old is just sitting there laugh on how easy it is to change the game files after watching it from a youtube video Then the Asians that think its so funny to flood the servers and a make it so so laggy for the rest of us to the point you should just die before you hit the ground cause you running up to that M16 and all the sudden some other guy has it and your dead before you realise that he came through the door at moch 50 with his speed hacks And its not like Blue hole hasn t banned 1000 s of accounts due to hackin but there is a thing called money and alot of people have it and they can just buy the game again on an another account and just continue punishment free What they should be doing is blocking IP s for repeated offenders instead of giving them a aquivilant of a slap on the rist People are making 1000 s of dollars off selling hacks for this game and how to diable delete the battle eye launcher Their dev team needs to work more on getting rid of the trash in the game rather that work on a new map to fill with more trash i would not reccoment this game tell these devs decide to get off their money pile and fix their mod of a mod of a game
Cant stop playing
Very well made Recommend
Full of chinese hackers on every server LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off back to your own server you orcs Also fix the the armor system you degenerates
Do you like being pwn3d by h4x0rs Do you like being treat like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  by the developers Do you like boringlack of updates Do you like a company that bans anyone cry baby streamers whinge about Do you want to PAY more for maps that should be included with the game Do you like paying for crates the devs promised wouldn t be in early access Overall highly overrated gameLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  developers
910 can be laggy but its still lots of fun
I love this game I especially love the test server because it gives everyone a sneak peak at new updates an honest 55 for me and my favourite game on steam
The hitboxes are as good as my grades
A game that can be played to joke around with friends or play to win and still have fun With every game having new scenarios you ll always be doing something new unless you love dropping in the same place With a new map and weapons coming in the following months content will definitely not be boring for a long time I don t know why all these other people give it bad reviews but if you get REALLY that salty over video games maybe don t buy this one then But for a game that s 30 and regularly getting new content it s a worthwhile buy for me And if you re looking to win I d say I m below average skill but I ve still won two games in my current play time  please note one was in a duo and the other was in squadDon t forget to read the spec requirements though and have a decent internet provider or else it may well be very unstable for the time being I would say I have a decent rig and internet and I get little lag on minimum It s not a game to be played at Max setting anyway
Is a good game to play especially with firends in a squad Make for some memorable moments and helps since I post game to YouTube
No South African servers makes this game useless to the south african community
Is good game definitley worth it even tho pubg gets a ton of trash they working on it
This game was horrible But the changes in the 10 Update changed so muchThis game became really good and I would recommend it to everyoneOnly think that bothers me are the terrible hitboxes and the awful loot system Keep up the good work
it s a bad game dont buy It s so bug and stucky and after all the game was fine but the new update it s destroyed the game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE     i want to sell this game but i can t guys dont buy this game the update destroyed everything
The game is super fun but not optimized at all The game only uses 50  of the gpu and puts all the pressure on the cpu with up to 90  usage plz fix this
nice game but need bug fix
Its a great game very addicting its very fun with freinds but do keep in mind that you will rage at this game while fun sometimes you will get a death were you have great eqipment but somebodys sneeks behind you and kills you with a pan but that is what will keep you going because your always so close but every now and then you will get that sweet victory where you killed your way to the top these moments are the most satisfying you worked hard played for hours and eventually got that sweet sweet victory i highly reccomennd this game it is a blast to play but pls dont do what i did where i played 8 games got nowhere near the top tn and just rage quit it super fun with freinds and a blast to play
This game defines a whole new world for gaming though its still inearly access I cant imagine how great this game will be when completely done To the creators A job SUPER well done
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in lags and 30 way too much
lamnotMark ChellyS i am gbaeg let s play next time
This game runs like a steaming pile of garbage and it doesn t seem like the devs give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I ve got a GTX 1080 ti and ryzen r7 1700x with plenty of high speed ram run this game on low settings AND I STILL DROP FRAMES AND GET MASSIVE LAG SPIKES CONSTANTLY  I thought this would get better with time but turns out the devs don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  since their game is already successful  This is why preordering games should be illeagal
This is lit 
Most overrated game ever Don t buy if you re looking for a quality product
this is is so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Rubber banding is so fun honestly why don t we all just enjoy struggling to move from 1 space for a ridiculous amount of time Until they sort these awful servers out I won t be spending anymore time on this game
Hmm bad game  
came back to properly review this game after many hours on H1Z1 PUBG Fortnite and Dayz Honestly this is the only one i would recommend out of the all the battle royale games Sure it has flaws and glitches here and there but most games do 1010 feel like home when i come back to PUBG after some dumb 12yos build a fort at the top of the map and snipe me into 25th place
Just got a loot box in game and it asked me to buy a key with real money to open it   trash too many problems to have to deal with greedy tactics like that too peace out off to fortnite i go
i think this is a really good game because of that u are able to fight against other people like a team but also alone if you feel like having a lucky day The downsights about the game is that is not really opimized for games with a budget pc so if you dont want to spend money on a better pc wait untill the game get its optimization and dont buy the game Else go for it its actually really fun but very intensive GG
with the latest update you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up whole thing game keeps crashin all the time i cant get into a game
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game made by a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  company Please have someone who knows how to actually program a game create one like this
Its good I guess I don t know Early access yup
1010 i die
Do not buy this game if you dont have a pc of the year because i have a GTX 1060 3GB with 8 Go of rams and all the time when the game start it takes 30 to 40 sec to load the buildings so I can not take any guns Wait for updates because this game is not optimize
great excepts hackers
best game ive played yet
laglowfps why do i keep playing this piece of garbabe
Despite the hacker infestation and the money grubbing nature of this game each round played is a very fun unique experience where every kill feels well earned  Even a 15 minute game without firing a shot can get your blood pumping  it could look A LOT smoother and perform better but the gameplay currently makes up for this
Hoping they fix the game crashing and a few in game things like the floating rocks you hit the rocks and take damage But this games very fun and addicting
don tclaimyoulike PUBG unless you ve played Minecraft hungergames
It s an alright game Bit of luck bit of skillYou get a bunch of maps to play on and gear unique to certain mapsA classic Battle Royale experience if thats your thing go for it otherwise don t go for itPerformance can vary from patch to patch so keep that in mindIf you want to test out the game for free and see if you like it you can try the mobile version of the game

564 hours on record Game full of hackers worse than any time i ve ever played CS GOWhen is Bluehole going to start requiring Hardware Identification to ensure bans are enforced on physical components of the computer Register your motherboard digitally or graphics card if you ve been banned you can t login to the game Bluehole not happy with your 46B valuation  Do what i said above and setup another company in which you can check potential purchases against your database this will mean hackers will have no resale value and have to buy hardware again if they want to continue hacking this will offset your losses in revenue from the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  weak anti cheat you have in order to generate falsified purchase figures and inflated revenue
I like that game a lot
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fukin game with tournaments with prices   crashes every few games   in 10 hours i have 5 crashes aprox Gay game also snipes are gud   you should buy this game
this game would be amazing if 1 the servers werent client sided 2 rng didnt determin who won 3 OPTIMIZATION
There are a lot of reviews giving this game quite a few of negatives and honestly a couple are deserved There is a major problem with hackers and cheaters ruining games and the loot boxes aren t that fruitful usually Prior to the vaulting update mobility can be challenged by a simple fence reaching up to your kneesWith those out of the way I can honestly say this game is 100  a fantastic choice for anyone looking for great team based game play that has a focus not just on run and gun quake style killing but really making tactical choices That is the key that separates this game so distinctly from other Battle Royal style games like FN More on FN later The weapon attachments vehicle choices movement  crawl for safety rush to the zone or loot more and risk taking damage  and distinct style of each gun really lets you set up for certain styles of game play I m the mid low range guy in our group that prefers shorter range combat like shotguns for instance The que in this game is nonexistent It s amazing how fast you ll get pulled into a game full team or solo It almost trivializes death   Oh I got so far only to get plucked by a lucky shot Ah well   instant reque  It goes a lot to reduce frustration when you can just jump from one game to another while at the same time keeping the game intense when scrapping for gear or getting to that final circle As far as Fortnite goes I hear the two games compared quite a bit and every time always have to bring up the fact that game modes do not mean game styles FN completely lacks the tactical edge and accuracy of PUBG  your guns don t have nearly the level of customization you have to deal with quality of loot and your accuracy with most guns is fairly poor Use of cover is discouraged in a lot of places because most all cover is  destructible  You can build cover and walkways and such in that game adding a very interesting aspect that PUBG lacks but doesn t do much to change how the game is played  in a much more run and gun fashion Overall I would suggest this game to people who are looking for quick intense games that don t require a permanent investment You won t find any levels bonuses or any gimmicks like that here Team play gives so much more of a fun experience as wellHope this review helped
It made me waste 200hours of my life on it when I could have went and prepared for my SAT
simply not complete enough to be a product
Worth every dollar

This game is extremely fun After hours of playing this game just gets better and better After a while you start loving this game Sometimes it gets glitchy but I blame that due to the fact that it is still in the Early Access stage When the full release comes this game will be amazing I guarantee it
this game will legit give you aids
Unoptimised poor hacker control boundless amount of glitches The only satisfying thing about PUBG is landing a multikill making a long ranged kill and winningBut then again developers should improvises daily to continue making the game worth if not it s starting to die off
It s really fun and entertaining
waiting for next update to fix optimization

Fun game to play I havent enjoyed a FPS this much since Day of Defeat Before PUBG I played WoW and Overwatch There are a bunch of glitches bugs and server issues still but it doesnt ruin the game for me Those issues actually are part of the charm in some ways because when you die you can chalk it up to that instead of user error Sometimes I hate this game but still love it Landing in a hot zone and searching 3 4 houses to no avail for a weapon and then get blasted by some noob sucks but sometimes the tables turn and it feels so good While the loot box system in this game is purely cosmetic it purely sucks I hope they change it up During gamescon I bought 60 worth of the special event loot crates and got 6 pairs of identical common pants feelsbadman I dont mind buying crates and lootboxes I feel like it helps support the game and future content but I wont be buying anymore of their crappy crates until they change that I ve seen some cheaters but every game has them All in all great game Well worth the money spentFun Factor   10
chicken dinner 
piece of shiiiiiiiiiit
No Linux support
Hottest game of 2017And this broken and laggy clusterLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is all it has to offerThis is a prime example of what happens when AAA titles start following mobile trends and turn their games into overpriced dlc and microstransaction simulators People lower their standards to a degree that this game becomes acceptable which is just wrong click this link I have reached the maximum lettersThis is where I start talking about the game in depth if you want a quick summary it s at the end The Community It is very clear that the individuals playing this game aren t very smart and they can only look at what s in front of themMost of the people here are very obsessed with this game defending it like it s their own childSorry to break it to you fanboys but a game isn t immune to criticism just because it s in  Early Access Now for every bug and glitch you ll encounter your EA excuse won t help anymoreNot to mention this game isn t worth the praise it s getting by these brainless idiotsThe game didn t improve much since first Alpha test and Full Release  the vehicles and sound are the only exceptionAnd i m sure even here they ll comment about how i have X hrs in the last two weeks and how am I not satisfied if I played for X hrs on record The Concept and Gameplay The core gameplay is good and it s very addicting I enjoy my time playing this game with friends when everything is going in my way but then RNG kicks in to ruin all your funIt is very clear that the devs didn t know how to execute this idea properlyFor a game that requires a lot of skill it s heavily based on RNGEverything from RNG loot  Sometimes you walk into a house and leave fully geared other times you come out with nothing and sometimes you only find ammo without guns what s up with that  to the Blue Circles  Instead of making everyone go to a zone where nobody is in one lucky LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er gets to camp and shoot the others running to the zone and even then that s not the worst idea they implementedMeet the Reward SystemOh wait did I say reward  That s for people who reach Chicken Dinners every god damn game because if you don t make it to least TOP10  SOLO TOP5  DUO TOP3  SQUADS you basically wasted your time gathering loot for other people The problem is that you don t feel awarded at all sure you get your BP that s worth nothing but what now  You re going to buy your useless crate and get another LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  shirt  Yeah I ll pass on that The Optimisation Before we start if you played this game already I d like to ask you to go and see the  Minimum Requirements  for yourself Comment down below if you truly believe that that is the case and the game would run even on 40 fpsEven tho this game looks like it s from 2014 modern GPUs and CPUs still struggle to run it What s up with that I can swear I spent the first 20 hours of the game just trying to tweak this game and settled for 1024x768 4 3 Lowest Settings and 4 Launch Options just so that I could get a steady  50 60 fps without dipping into low 40s 30sEDIT  Adding this here as suggested by iPlayerThe game uses the CPU heavily which is a bad choice since GPUs are way superior and more advanced at the moment  For instance I have a i5 4570 and a GTX 780ti 8GB of RAM and the game is on SSD That gets me  50 fps  My friend on the other hand has i5 3570 GTX 1060ti  The 6GB model because a lot of people seem to forget this a review about the game and not a GPU 20GB of RAM and the game is on HDD That gets him almost a few fps more than me but still no stable 60fps  If you consider buying this game expecting a stable 60fps you should invest in a i5 6400 or better  Hope this helpsThis game doesn t have and probably won t ever have any optimisation unless they start putting time and resources into it but they won t Why  Because it requires a lot of funds Would you honestly expect a company that added paid crates after they said they wouldn t to fund a project that wasn t necessary in the first place even after grabbing 60 Millions from the game sales alone  Didn t think soLet s not forget about the servers as wellI laugh at myself for complaining about CS GO s 64 steady ticks when we got this garbage over here that has different tick rates depending on which server you join Not only that but it s not even stable it can range anywhere from  35 to even low 28 which is just unacceptable for today s competitive gaming resulting in almost half of your shots  hits not registeringHere s a video so you can visualise just how bad it really is https wwwyoutubecomwatch vevM0kXHTgvEhttps wwwyoutubecomwatch v1KWw8I8dp6MPut this into your Launch Options if you re struggling to get fps even with the lowest settings maxMemXXXX mallocsystem USEALLAVAILABLECORES sm4Don t forget to change   maxMemXXXX  to your desired RAM amount in MB The Sound They drastically improved sound in the 10 patch so i ll give them some applause for thatBut what they didn t do is fix the Surround Sound It will still be as bad as it is nowIt seems that if the sound is coming from below 30 to any side from your point of view it doesn t change and still sounds the same as it would be directly in front of youAnother problem I have with it that there s no way to tell if sound is coming from the front or the back which is a big drawback at least for meEverything combined it makes it very hard to pin point a person or footsteps there s no way to tell if somebody is in a second or third floor not to mention first floor footsteps are for some reason more silent than the ones above or below The Devs I will avoid talking about the drama between Fortnite and BlueHole since it s irrelevant to this gameThey are a jokeNot only do they go back on their promises they also probably won t even finish the game if it loses the popularityThere s no communication between the community and the devsThey re straight out avoiding the complaints about cheaters even tho they can clearly see it in every discussion pageAnd now they re thinking of releasing this game for consolesThey have officially released the game on Xbox One and Xbox One XThis video will show you all you need to know https wwwyoutubecomwatch vMdGBwrJ6rtIThis game is still in EA for god s sake there shouldn t be any talk about console portsFix and release your game first then we can discuss if this game even needs one in the first placeI also do not like how they re always in streamers  asses Banning innocent people because of  Stream Snipping  like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off I know they re the only reason your game is alive but you could ask them to make a delay or stream on their own risk no  Why do we have to suffer when you re the ones who are biased Summary also a tl dr to some degreeThis game isn t good and it doesn t deserve the attentionIt s messy and filled with bugs and crashes The problems range from RNG unfairness to the core gameplay itselfThe devs don t seem to listen to people but the community doesn t care making it an endless cycleStay away if you have a bad rig there s other games you can play that don t require a NASA computerIf I were to get a refund right now I d take it and I would never look back unless they change their waysThat s all folks

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing PUBGpeople in the water are not killed
Game is fun and has a great concept behind it It will be hard to find many people that disagree with that That said the game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed almost unplayable and i say this because in a shooter you require bullets to always hit their target and register Not hit blood splatter and person take no damage  Ive emptied full clips and nothing also hit a people in the head withwithout helmets multiple times and nothing It has many performance issues which render it almost unplayable the game suffers major flaws   bullets not registering  constant drop outs  desync  glitches and moreI played it with the hope that the devs would eventually fix the issues that the game has It has been quite a long time now I keep seeing more and more content added yet none of the major bug fixes You can read this and think that there are some people saying it s fine and performance isn t an issue From my understanding these people are little fan boys that need to pull their head out of their LOVE LOVE LOVE  Yes the devs post they have fixed bugs but with the money they have made any decent dev team who actually cared would have completely overhauled the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  code they used and developed a game worthy of the concept they have come up with If you want to spend your money on a game that is far from finished and lets be honest will probably never be finished go ahead But if you re having doubts then by all means go and buy something else that is proven to be good This game still needs huge amounts of work but that goes with any game in early development The reason Im giving this a negative review is because the devs continue to put hours of work into adding useless content to try and suck in more innocent people rather than actually fix what is wrong with the game Devs should not betray their supporters they need to show appreciation by eliminating issues that cause bad gameplay rather than continually add content to a game which already has more than enough content for an early release If the game runs there are a variety of items and in this case one working game mode that should suffice for testing purposes and devs should focus on making the game more playablereliable Obviously this wasnt the case with battlegrounds What makes this even worse is there is a bunch of previously mentioned fan boys defending the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game and its screwed up coding They are saying things like Its expect of a game in early access or Devs are busy working on it or The game works fine for me LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE S the game doesnt run fine for anyone Go watch live streamers and you will see at least one glitch every game Stop defending a company that is robbing its supportersTL DR in current state put simply the game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed Spend your money on something else In the future this game might have all of its glitches fixed but I highly doubt it based on how the devs want to spend resources
Full of Cheaters if you want to waste hours deliver weapons to cheaters this is the one
I was really hoping that as this game matured that it would begin to feel more polished and cleaned up  It has only gotten worse  This game looks and feels like its 10 years  It is not inutitive  It just feels wonky  The first 200 hrs were fun of my experience then I realized this team was not going to deliver  I do not believe they are capable  PUBG is the promising rookie that just doesn t ever live up to the hype  It passes for a good time with the fellas but chalked up to its peers I d give it a C
It didnt even launch for me
With the amount of money this game has generated they should at least take the hackers off the leader board that have 250 KD ratios They need to get rid of the cheating They also need to fix the OC servers lag issues FPSoptimisation issues bugs glitches the list is ENDLESS I cannot believe they are releasing this game on XBOX What a joke All to make a quick buck DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
Your game optimazion is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  fix it or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  YOU GET CANCER LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING STUPID DEVELOPER TEAMyour game have more problems than H1Z1 you stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing optimazion im running 90x gtx 1090Ti and 900gb ram and still getting 21fps
The game is almost ruined by the Cheaters The reason why the cheater are everywhere is because the BLUEHOLE Studio doing nothing to control these and even allow some cheaters to stream online For example the well know LOL player White who has over several millions fans played PUBG with scripts for a long time There are a lot of video evidence online can show that he was cheating however the BLUTHOLE never think about ban his account I would not recommdate this game to any other people since the experience will be destoried by the cheaters
It feels that with every update they make for this game it gets worse and worse It would be nice if the F ckhead devs would do something to optimize this trash It s a good game with good potential but it keeps getting ruined with every update that comes out

My number is sealed a few months have no play to play a few more to be sealed eat two chicken to seal your company true garbage does not check to confuse the number There are fewer than 10 people killed the game query is not open what do you do with PUBG employees  Can you check it 
Concept of the game is great but the performance is not Laggy servers looting can get laggy at times I wouldn t recommend the game until its all fixed The test server shows some of the updates but still not update in the actual game
There are more Chinese speaking players on NA than there are English speaking players  Don t bother unless you have three friends to play with
Tons of hours played loved the game right up untill everyone from asia started playing in NA servers Also there are tons of hackers Thanks blue hole for giving me a bloody hole  _ 
if you are a cheater then this game is for youotherwise you are just cannon fodder  for the cheaters
Honestly one of my favorite games right now There are some bugs and hackers that can make the game somewhat unejoyable But being that those two things are rare the game is fun and competitve I view this as a musthave game
Game is greta and addicting
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game clone of h1z1
This game has way too many issues another map full of bugs in a glitchy game that needs ALOT of other work done first is just adding fuel to the fire on this pile of garbageI like to play super high so wasting my time on this piece of junk with friends doesn t feel so bad
this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is a little LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   THIS SHEAT CRASH  FOR ALL OVER A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING MONTH  I  can t open it and i can play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i pay  I TRY EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT OPEN BUT NOTHING HAPPENS  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS CRAP
My computer is very well built and more powerful than it should be just to run this game but for some reason the building DO NOT load in for me till after about a minute of hitting the ground ive do ne all the th8ings people have said to fix that issue and still nothing This game is my favorite game i have ever played its different every single time you get on great game other that the lag and the getting kicked and the textures not loading in
Good potential but way too badly optimized It s really not acceptable to charge 30 euro for  an  early access  game I remember a time when early access used to be free Now they charge us full price for testing their product It s a buggy and laggy mess I ran it on 60 FPS on medium settings but still then it had lag spikes here and there Might change this review in the future but for now i really can t recommend it
This game is full has tons of bugs and needs a lot of improvement from it s actual state but you can t deny it s extremely fun
This game is fun under the following conditions  Solo play or team play with friends   The NORTH AMERICAN servers are filled with people speaking mandarin  These individuals can t be reported for playing on the wrong server in a TEAM BASED gamemode  They also kinda suck from personal experience
hello i have proplms i cant play
love this game cannot wait for vaulting and the compass tweaks but other than that this game is well worth the 37 canadian to buy
Nope game got released and there still bugs like there were in earlly accese I thought they would fix it and nope still like early accese Don t bother buy something else instadEdit  still terrible performance is still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  many cheaters lags and really huge bugs and glitchs 1 year of early accese really  1 year  That s nothing it like they did nothing only 2 maps that s it  For then  Bluehole the game may be finished but for me and i m sure for many players it s still have the feeling that it s in early accese
Update Queued    255 MBAnd this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  appears like 5 times a day lol
Good game and very fun to play with friends

Could you do someting to fix the lag of server  Not Test ServerI don t want to play this game which  bad server  Not Test ServerJust do someting please
A chinese anchor named white obviously used plug in  and everybody knows it in chinaWhy won t you do something     
it be great if the game flowed nice for a change how hard is your job 
Best game ever i have already played this game over 200hrs So far the best game but it needs some rework with optimization with 960gtx
Amazing game I personally can t get enough of it Cs Go and PUBG are my favourite games by far I can t tell which one I like more but I will not get bored of this game I would recommend playing this game on a Pc that would let you run at a high FPS as this is an important factor to winning PvP battles Would highly recommend
Such an intense gamem to play with your friends
Very coolVery nice
Release date December of 2017     Are you kidding me    You can t call this a full game with this insanely huge amount of bugs and hackers ruining about 40  of the games I do enjoy this game but the fact that its supposed to be near release is sad This is nowhere near a finished product
blem 
Yes the game is amazing and ive had hours of joy with it But Bluehole really needs to step up the speed at which they release optimization updates and i am looking forward to the new map update which will breathe some much needed life into this game Overall would recommend
I highly recommend this game if you are into fast pace shooter games it is fun both with friends and without I also recommend to download this game to an SSD if possible to reduce load times and crashes
This game offers you hope in the beginning allowing you to explore a rich environment and amass an impressive array of weaponry and gear 20 minutes later it will proceed to ram you up the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with a 50 cal sniper round you never saw coming And you ll only want to do it again and again and again
JUST DO IT EDIT  NVM DONT DO ITJust fix the servers bro
meh
az sum gosho
need more optimization
It is a very good game in which right now i have 500 hours and i still want to play more Beside the lag that hopefully soon will be fixed it is amasing
One of the best shooters in recent years
My friend bought me this game for helping him fix his laptop all so we could play together so far I ve sunk 233 hours into this game and it easily is one of my favorite amogst the Battle Royales    there are a few minor issues I have but the gameplay is pretty solid which makes for a different enjoyable experience everytime I play whether it alone or with friends
witnessed a guy get run over by a buggy just to have that buggy destroyed by a falling bomb 1010
55
Aweasome
Very addictive game but really need to have a better control for cheaters and the dev needs more time optimizing the game
Just to get my badge xD
gameplay is stale boring and RNG based Just my humble opinion tho everyone likes a different style of gameAs for the game itself  poorly optimised for even high end rigs loooots of bugs  poor servers with low tickrate    no regs all over the placeGame wants to make up for these issues by telling you  it s just beta phase we re still developing  imo its quite obvious that this game wont make it out of the  beta  phase before its pretty much dying off if at all Same story as with Rust
The best  Battle Royale  game
Gd
Good game way better than i expected
Very noice
yeah just don t I took 6 hours setting up my network forwarding ports updating drivers to find out the game runs like mascara on a emo kid running away from a beating on a warm summers evening with no breeze and of course because the games run for so long and it took me so long to realise it was the game that was LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  not my setup  be aware if game is on it s timer ticks it is NOT gameplay time you see I get no refund waste of hard earned money
Plese fix gamm yes
Really Really good  D
Frag or Surviveeither way its an amazing game
the probably most addicting and jump scare game of all time
oknobody ever expects to be like me but here i am still addicted 200ish hours in210  and counting hours in and this game still feels like the first 10 It just has the toned down h1 vibe that i used to always wish for  Dthis game is a reimagined masterpiece of h1z1 they built the game around the idea of battle royale where as you know h1z1 was built with survival aspects in mind  z1 Much better pace and all around movement feels more human  dont worry vaulting will complete it Although it has a long way to go the sky is the limit here
SICKEST GAME OUT
good game which caues depression and anxiety when ever you died by the redzone kar98Gorza would die again 
it good to play with your friendbut watch out for china JK
Absolute CHAOS best game very satisfying to win
You and 99 cheaters Good luck
Most exited ever I play
eSports ready
For anyone who finds dayz pvp enjoyable this game can bring you those butt clech moments
Hellowhy is there 3 updates every single day this is getting annoying
This is a very nice game  D
Lots of cheating Can be a very slow paced gameDevelopers seem to keep bringing out big updates but not much changes with the bugs they just add new clothing and reward cratesWhen the game fisrt came out the crate you got was not locked now more and more of the crates come with padlocks that cost 250 to buy a key that opensDevelopers seem more interested in raking in money than optimizing the game
Dont play
Cool game and good graphics
A review for this game is meaningless because who doesn t know about this game Even if you haven t played it you have seen someone else play it and probably already know if you would enjoy this game or not The game is pretty much everything it advertises to be Its an enjoyable battle royalelast man standing game that throws 100 players onto an island  and soon a desert to fight it out PUBG is a very fun game that has held my interest for about 250 hours I would say im pretty bored with it now but I find myself coming back to it everynow and again with a friend or squad which is the most enjoyable aspect of this game  teamplayIf you are interested in playing this game I would say go for it but do it quickly The devs are pushing the esports scene for this game way too hard for what it is The best part of a battle royale style game is the randomness and unfairness of each game Somegames you find amazing stuff some games you dont Flight path airdrops bomb zones area circles vehicle spawns loot quality   quantity are all random and is the main reason these games don t get repetitive quickly Pushing esports would lead to these aspect being somewhat balanced essentially killing the game At its current state though its a really enjoyable game and I hope the devs make the right decisions going forward 710
I have had this game for about 3 months already and I have seen no updates to fix the texture melting and constant crashing People keep saying it is because I don t have an SSD but when I got one I get the same problems from when I didn t have one I would not recommend this game save yourself 30 dollars
Great game to play especially with friends
AN AMAZING GAME
Vale todo su peso en oro
So much lag and rubber banding that even hitting a player is straight up RNG even if you aim straight at them Right now the servers are running at 17 tick rate Yes SEVENTEEN tickrate look it up I will never recommend this game to anyone until they upgrade their garbage servers
This game just keeps on getting better and better
It s a solid game that is well worth if you like the idea behind the battle royale fps Yes hackers are a thing the game it glitchy as hell and sometimes a bike will randomly stop and you won t However I have had more fun on this game than most other recent games and it should really be added to your collection
Found pan Thought I could make some eggs Didn t have eggs Player shot pan Pan now has dent Player kissed pan Player dead 1010 would pan again
Good game still lot of things to patch servers are too laggy  waiting for the release
Nothing like Chicken Dinner 4 times in a row  D
GOOD GAME THE BEST GAME EVER
In all honesty the reviews dont do this game justice yeah there is a lag problem and yeah its poorly optimized but I havent had this much fun in a game in a long time even rounds where you immediately drop into a gunfight or drop next to someone and make a mad dash for a gun while he grabs the ammo for it and you have to brawl it out to determine who lives and who dies is so much fun Its early access so it has all the problems with that and the crates are LOVE LOVE LOVE  ive gotten the same pair of blue jeans 4 times in a row and those crates are not cheap all in all this game could be great but the devs have some work ahead of them if they want this to keep going
You already know you want it just buy it for the 30 bucks and make money off the market
BROKEN lots of cheaters
Very Fun game playing with friends But Cheaters breaks balance sometime And game performance on lower end PC is bad
Game has a very well executed concept but has a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of tech issuesPass this one until it gets fixed
810 if you play alone or with random teams   sometimes 1010 with funny randoms1210 with friends
Wait this game isnt out of early access 
I love this game Just the constant battle and constant fighting is amazingI LOVE IT
Bon petit jeu avec quelques bugs fatiguants
Garbage game go in is the fairy fight every time the landing is not a few minutes to be killed and reopened today the line is actually sealed the real game experience is extremely poor
This game runs like crap feels like crap and looks like crap I don t know why everybody plays this garbage but holy ballsack please make some other game popular

     UPDATE AMD USERS AVOID I Have ryzen 1400 with rx580 and its at the point where i cant even load into the game anymore with my friends     I wasnt going to review this game becuase duh everyone knows its good especially with friends but now
its got potential but it sucks right now all you do is wait and run from the zone sometimes you might find some guns dont count on it tho
This game is like McDonald s great but bad for your health All in all I d recommend it on top of all for people which have lots of friends to play people who like to get serious and  competitive  so to speak which are alright playing alone but if you re just wanting to play from time to time consider it only if your budget easily alowes it
pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server s
Most fun you can have before getting sniped in the back

Bloated engine with very bad server optimizationFeatures that works on paper but are a pain while playingQOL and fixes are long overdueAfter a few rounds it gets boring and there is no competitive scene to continue watching
                 
Player Unknown s Battlegrounds a perfect game yet room for improvement I would recommend this if they fix some things I understand the developer s struggle They developed this huge game and it is not a full game Read what it says  IT IS EARLY ACCESS  so therefore it is not a fullgame it is not completed So therefore it is pretty buggy I could see it being better in the future
Playing this just because of friends after 302 hrs of playing optimization still like a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dont tell me the early access LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t they should have put this as a priority if they want this game to be an   okay   game bought this game for 30 euros definitely not worth it 410
Very badly made Would not rccomend in its current state
the refusal to region lock has caused the servers to become so lagged an desynced to the point its nearly unplayable
Amazing game with great potential I would buy this game if you are able to just make sure your PC can run it or make sure you can handle it yourself

I really love this game I cannot wait for the official version
I m not going to tell you this game is good As is it is honestly pretty bad However from what I have seen and heard about the 10 release version that will be released in December gives me hope that the game will be fantastic From gameplay looting looks 1000x smoother ballistics is improved driving is not so spastic and it lags so much less due to optimization The addition of a new map which is set to release with 10 will give the game a fresh feel as it grows New guns and vehicles are also something I look forward to with the 10 release Thus I recommend this game and feel like it deserves a 8510 because of how bad it is right now but how amazing the official release looks Buy it now in case the price raises following the official release
Awesome game Addicted me in a way that only cs had managed to do before

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game fix vehicle hit boxes LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is an amazing game with great potential sure it has quite a few glitches and that who ads conterversy was a turn off but other than that it is one of the games that i can actually play for fun and not get too competitive
The 100th game is just as nerve racking and adrenaline inducing as the 1st Very excited to see where this goes in the future
Wonderful yet poorly optimized
addicting cancer  3
This LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game XD
Even though it s still in early access it s a great game The developers actively work on it with a big update coming soon I would recommend it if you like these types of games and have a decent PC to run it on as the performance isn t amazing
this game is just awesome

I hate this game but I love this game This is a game that will make you frustrated beyond belief but you will still hit that ready button for another game right after Highly recommend if you have no social life or want to game with friends and all be mad but laugh
Runs very unoptimized but lovely to play with friends and has good potential

This game have potential and i have lots of fun playing itI wish developer can optimise this game for low end pc and increase the tick rate to acceptable level

Garbage Opimization and only getting worse When I first started playing it was fun for a while but now its just which side of the map are the AWM shots coming from or why does it feel like im playing on a potato while on this game
Overall great game It definitely has its ups and downs but if you love a good fire fight this is your game
Really neat game Some ups and downs but the devs really are trying to make the game as good as possible
Listen this game is ok As long as you can tollerate being slaughterd from long distance by a Mini14
Well This game highly promotes hiding camping shooting accurately from miles away like it s nothingIt s a campfest Huge optimization problems never getting stable fps laggy servers teleporting players  movement I don t know how this game got so big
a game if you want anxiety or huge amounts of fun
welcome to the new minecraft
I love this game It s DayZ with lots of improvements and sped up
optimization is kinda LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  But still fun
This game is really fun and addicting and is never boring due to its constant action
Grenade deflected to the window   
this is a very good game whether your playing in a squad a duo or just by yourself it gives the gamer good gameplay good suspense  especially when you make it to top 10 and definitly worth the hours and hours of game time
Solid game
Released 10 same issues as Early Access rubber banding almost all the time game breaking issues like getting stuck in the lobby and many others
Fun if there wasnt so many bugs
Good game but has residentsleeper gameplay 60  of the time
i got 2 wins than tked my friend he repoted me than i got banned 4hrs latter
Just fix the inconsistent frames and hacking problem it ll be great again
vedy nice
Great game for a game that s still in Early Access Optimization of the game is a must need for this game besides that it runs great BanTheHackers PLEASE
Stop forcing me to play third person solo
Very cool Very nice
its pretty cool when you find good stuff and get sniped from who knows where
Very fun and thriling until you get killed by random bug or glitch Fps is terible idk how this can be competetiveGets boring after while Only fun in this game is driving arround with friends and pretending to play NFS unerground
Broken as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but also fun as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 57
Really fun game to play with friends require a peculiar set of skills 910 only thing about this game it needs to get optimal since sometimes it crashes or get stuck not only for me but for other people as well
I purchased this game on early access and already feel like i got my money s worth It is very difficult to win solo but when you do its the greatest I would wait for a sale and pic it up for sure
One Of The Best Multiplayer Games I Have Ever Played
Best Game Ever 1010Stutters like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Still playable sometimesCrash just when you re in that top 10 list and when you re about to winFIX IT BLUELOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE

Hella early access many changes will take place very slowly pubg is pretty glitchy and poorly optimize but it is a lot of fun  probably only with a squad

I would rather buy winrar but still good game
This Game is an absolutly great game It consists of an emence amount of total LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t and a substantial amount of retardation The game had potential but it decided to eat its own LOVE LOVE LOVE  and suck its self off When you just about the wina  game Network lag detected Your side is find but the stupid servers are horrible Furthermore The amounmt of Hackers and misuse of terms and conditions make the game feel very frustrating I would highly recommend you dont play this game as its not worth the investment of time and money to wait for the problems to be fixed or patched Trust me if you like getting aggrovated this is the game for you
auto ban cheatasss plis
Aside from server lag FPS lag and pure LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t when shooting other players it s a fun game
I d like to say that PUBG is a very good game if you have a decent processor and Graphics card and it runs pretty smooth but you ll have the choppy frames in Yasnaya Polyana and other big areas but as the game progresses through trial and error via the test servers the frames are good same with loading but the servers are laggy alot of the times but you get used to it I would recommend this game to all whho like fun and the best game on steam but if you re gonna wait for 1O release I could nt blame you Cya all on the Battlegrounds
Good ganme   
Still needs work but the developers are really going at it and you can see their hard work paying off on a game that I ve come to have a love hate reatlionship withOverall a must try
Bu review badge iin yazlmtr
Although the servers are usually LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  it still provides exhilarating experiences
Its alright
Awesome game to be played This game beats all game innovations
This game is the most played game of 2k17 and it LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing sucks  the game runs LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but the gun play is nice But hey most importantly this game is one massive meme every LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  meme was made while in the  wait while the game starts  segment and how could i forget the streamers gettting streamsniped by 20 or so 12yr olds while playing bass boosted  im sorry  DANK BOOSTED  songs and ytp memes anyway i give Donkeykong country a 45   IGN
If you want some chickenThis is your gameJust watch out for the Chinese
Impossible frustration with the unoptimized nature of this game
11 pans of 10 pans
Too much overrated
I love this game with a passion Although those tiny things with desync lag and a couple of bugs may get in the way this game will soon be developed towards perfection This is one of the only games that I play that actually care about the cheaters If you are planning to buy this go ahead just dont get angry at the fact that things work against you cause it will happen a lot Keep playing the game and maybe you will end up with some chicken dinners
Noticed now that there are 2 maps i only get the dessert one and when i exit the match twice i have to restart the game before i can get into another match
very knice
Fantastic game to play would definitely recommend buying this game because its fun to play on your own and even better with friends
I ts not as bad as people say They just like to complain
The game needs optimization badly
its an amazing game GET IT
Best Game For Battle Royal XD
Atlast something different and good unlike all fps shooter games
This game gives a sense of adventure and thrill that none other canEvery round is like a different kind of movie  Action adventure even romance and comedy lol but is very tense and enjoyable Go make your own movie with your friendsIT IS UNOPTIMISED AND HAS MANY BUGSSTILL FUN  3
The developers have created a great game in concept They lack the ability to follow through with an optimized game that can actually run on mid level gaming computers Lag  be is FPS or server related is a common complaint and it has yet to be addressed effectively The developers have had plent of time to work on the common issue s and at least attempt to fix them It seems that the game dev s are not focused on these issue s I m running a GTX 1060 FTW 6Gb GPU and the game is unplayable at all graphics settings
This game is super lit AF fam and it should win the award bc its just amazing
Poorly optimized terrible servers lots of lag hackers everywhere Come on devs you ve got millions and millions of dollars hire better engineers to fix the servers and patch the game up so that hackers don t ruin the game for usSucks when you and your squad do well at the beginning get fairly kitted out while noticing there s a player killing everyone else in the server very quickly with a Kar98k to then have that same player kill you and your whole squad in less than a minute whom turns out was hacking the whole time hence why he was able to obliterate so many players in a very short timespan with a Kar98k This is a common ocurrence not necesarily with a Kar98k but when it happens with certain guns it s a lot easier to notice Like the time my squad and I got wiped by a single player with a crossbow who headshotted all of us in less than a minute and then ran at super speeds by our bodies
BEST GAME BUT THAT OPTIMALIZATION SUCKS BUT I LOVE IT BEST GAME
Great game with a few issues Would recommend for anyone whose computer meets recomended specs
This game is amazing if you can play with friends
A MEI ZING Game
Pan Best armour1010 would pan again
Supert spill azza
Frame drops   CheckLag spikes   CheckBlatant hackers   CheckBugs   CheckBut ey we got vaulting yaaaaaaayyyyStill fun to mess around with have a squad of friends argue about loot sharing and ammo Only to be killed by some random flying full auto firing never reloading snap onto your head instantly mothertruckerE Sports ready amiright 
This game is fantastic i love playing and ofc i get mad at times but i always wonna come back and play it
Still got a long way to go yet its already so fun to play with friends gonna get that chicken ding ding bye
Fun Game too much De Sync It Can Get to the point to where you just get behind a wall and get shot by a person on the other side of said wall  RegionPing needs so badly to be implemented when running around in NA lobbies all you hear is Any Language besides those native to NA I feel atleast region lock Solos because they cant play with friends in solos and if they are then ban them I would reccomend this game I just feel instead of adding so much new content the devs need to fix the current issues at hand and hey maybe they will in the near future
Seems to be incredibly rushed a lot of beginner level errors are still somehow present   Terrible frames  Bad tick rate  No anti cheat to speak of  Number of bugs and glitches  Every patch breaks something or adds something noone asked forNope
this useless program was taking up storage on my computer
Very fun gameStill a lot need to fixLike the fps is very low really need optimizing
BUG G
alto juegito
Just don t expect too much
Decent game bit boring now tho
Even though this game isn t quite ready for to be published as full game I still rate this game 355 since it gets updates and fixes semi regularly In my opinion price is bit too high for this type of game I would gladly pay around 20 for this game If you don t want to learn this game and be frustrated about not hitting enemy don t buy this game as fun as it is
i dont think it deserves all the praise it got but it is by no means a bad game
gud gud gud
Wow  
full of bug of the stupid game
good game needs better optimazation still good game
Basically lord of the flies on some island in the Black Sea Hooray
kind of sucks but it s ok
 
Love this game could nt ask for much better
The overall concept of the game is great and if they had fixed everything this woule be game of the year no doubt The problem is the poor optimization resulting in lag disconnects and bad frame rates on top of the there is almost a cheater is every round and it makes the player feel like they were cheated when they were doing well A system similar to Valve s VAC ban system is needed that scans the players PC for any cheats The method that is used as of this review is simply not getting the cheaters banned and there is no feed back to whether or not your report actually got the player banned If these problems were fixed I d highly reccommed this game as for know I think I ll play Fortnite with the majority of the other players are going
 HackerS MakeS EverythinG WorsE  
I love this game It teaches me that real life doesn t make me as sad as I thought it did
best unoptimized and painful game i have ever played still good and fun tho

Well it is definetely entertaining

Impossible to play without optical fiberDo something with your netcode pls this is really really annoying i have so much lag issues with your game that I don t have with other ones  Fortnite for example So pls fix that your game is a diamond and I can t stand being unable to play it because of all the lags or LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ts that happens in itBy the way I have a usual ping of around 40 with any Europen servers so the problems doesn t come from me
Really fun but why you guys remove weather  It make the game suck and make some training course
FIX THIS BROKEN PIECE OF SHIT ASAPI put only 30 hours on this game but man that this game suckLagging game crush  servers are just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  crap i know that someone will say ohhhhh i have 2000 hours and the game is awesome i say to that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE T  ive died like 99  of the time fom shots that are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE T  i remember one time i shot a guy 40 bullets all head and chest tru a windows  he comes to me like uuuuu im the boss and kills me with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing UMP headshot from 50mtrs instant  he wasnt even cheating he was LEGIT but the game just decided he was betterHow IN THE WORLD WAS THIS GAME WARDED  Game of the year  is beyond meAnd cheatersohhhhhhhhhhhh  i used to belive CSGO had cheaters with over 2000 hrs in in but man this game with 30 hours ive found more cheaters than CS GO in over 2000In summary dont buy this if you have a slow heart cuz getting mad every match will kill you for sure

Playerunknown s battlegrounds is a breathtaking experience filled with tense moments of split second decisions that make you cry out in joy or break you down like the degenerate you areOver all i have enjoyed this game very much and will therefore say i recommend this game unfortunatly there are drawbacks to this gamepros great gameplaygood graphicsimmersion is amazingselling the crates i got from this game i have bought 2 other games Basically the game sells itselfconsCheatersLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  16tick serversrendering may be a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Pretty good game I m doing this for a badge
AMAZING KAPPA KAPPA
It s very unfinished unpolished and runs like absolute crap on a 1080Ti
Better than expected
WAOW BELY GUD GEM
Love the new updates devs are working hard on this game  Enjoying every moment of it
nice game too laggy
Absolutely terrible
Best Game eva
In my opinion the best BR out there BUT    The optimasation is ABSOLUTE SH T I mean like ABSOLUTE SH T  I m running on an i7 6700k with a gtx970 and i m still dropping down to 24fps at certain periods of the game  The worst bug I m getting is a simple network bug where my tickrate drops down to 01 or something similar and it is not even possible to sprint as the game just pushes you back as if you were slow walking almost impossible to even pick up a weapon in that state  You can bug in staircases walls cars pretty much everything  rare but still happens and essentially leaves u for dead cause there is no way to escape it  The genuine tickrate on all servers is very very poor You tend to get shot after you are behind a wall just because that extra half second the server didn t ping back your player got hit although on your screen you were behind already  Lower spec PCs will have a hard time even loading textures at the start which completely ruins all early game for a lot of peopleThe adrenaline out of this game is pure gold  when this piece of junk worksFirst BR that is extremely competitiveThe reward for winning is quite comparable to the Dark Souls franchise for those of you who played it you know how good that feels  DAll in all if the case was that I wouldn t anticipate another update from the current beta I d say screw this piece of garbage its not worth your money but since a legit version is actually coming out soon go for it might aswell get some training in before the real game is released
Fun but little buggy Play with your friends
Action packed battle royale game Easy to learn Drop into some high risk areas and kick some LOVE LOVE LOVE  However Just remember China Number One
I like the survival horror aspect of this game more than the Battle Royale itself
this game made me lots of money
Anger
Great game to play with friends just dont play if your starving Good luck getting the chicken dinner
Its funny how a free battle royale game like fortnite has 10x better netcode and is way smoother than a 30 one Just play fortnite
I loved this game when it first came out I was new to the  King of the Hill  style games and it became a lot of fun to play with friends Later into the life and this game is beginning to feel stale We ve been putting up with bugs and hackers now for sometime whilst it appears the developers are more interested in expanding to consolesI d recommend trying it but maybe later when they ve ironed out all of the current issues Please address the hackers
Still cant get enought of this game

goodgame 
Good game to play with some mates
I loved this game at first Who doesn t love battle royale games  Arma 3 then h1z1 and then this gem came along However this gem turned out to be a fake diamond The devs do not really give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  they say they do but their actions are too slow They say the game is incomplete but they knew they gave us a deadline for version 10 so they just threw some piece of better running LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for us But now I could live with that because the majority of devs just do not care What has pushed me over the edge was the hackers who ruin this game and I am not just trying to explain away loses I just got done playing a game where we got killed by a really suspicous Asian player Turns out after watching the replay that there was not just one squad hacking but there was a total of FOUR squads with at least one person hacking for a total of seven hackers This is not the only game as well I am uninstalling this garbage until they fix the hacker issue but I doubt they will fix it in any meaningful way
Best battle royale so far Ever heard of H1Z1  Well this is better Though if you don t have a good rig I wouldn t recommend buying this game  The optimization is not there yet
Best online game i have ever played
PLIS MI
very fun game me rate 1012
Excellent battle royal game  best with friends  New content still rolling it  Looking forward to playing this on xbox as well
Hackers on every server region and nothing is being done about it  Every hacker is using bullet speedfire rate hacks which blows my mind that they aren t instantly banned for doing so  If you see a xioa guang yang or qq9123845713 you know it s just going to be another game ruined  I would say that 910 games have hackers in them great game
This game can literally ruin fun when you land half the map away from a the circle and the red zone is right on top of you But the rush you get when you win a game is worth it 100  the built up adrenaline from every gunfight and intense looting will hook you on this game for hours
This game is as goofy as it is intense
Very fun game There are many different ways to play giving you a new experience every time you play Playing with friends is even more fun It can be rough sometimes if you dont have any experience with games like this but the learning curve isnt very steep Even if you arent that good minor skirmishes at the begin of the game or finding a house with someone in it can be thrilling The only downside is that the game is pretty difficult to run If you can run it definitely worth the price
I liked this game a lot It took me a long time to get over it I played for months straight on end I just hope they fix some of the things come release time one hunnid
This game is really good when played with friends definetly worth the 30 dollars
If you dont have a good Pc dont bother buy this game but if you have a good one and you enjoye this kind of game then PUBG is for you 
After 1 hour of playing all I can say is Wait Wait until the final version is outDo not buy the game right now Awful experience in every aspect  graphical optimization audio and it has nothing to do with my setup  100 25mpbs bandwith nice pcNot worth it Great idea Needs A LOT OF WORK
You will enjoy this game if you dont mind waiting every time you die
This game shows you a good time then rips it away from you with a kar98
The updates only make the game run worse for some reason not to mention the constant crashes and how overhyped the game is Unplayable right now
You re gonna die A lot But thats just how it is when only 1 or 2 out of 100 can win Its a spicy game but hard Good stuff
GREAT Game
Shoot Drug Drink and Chicken Dinner
fix ur LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  before you implement climbing
Fun competitive enjoyable  313 hours so far will play more Scroll up and buy
Time to Ban those hackers  4 hackers in 4 Game i think the anti cheat is broken at the time please fix otherwise lose your player so for now ill give 310 sorry  rager can gtfo
A great game fun to play with friends
Just don t play this game is a trash game for COD players that prefer to camp all over the flipping place
its just not good
Great game tons of fun Wish controller support was better
10 out of 10 would rate again
Mate if you re going to run around with 99 other strangers in underwear this would be it
i can t play this game for some reason it says connection timeout also this game runs badly and is glitchy 010
esports ready isnt giving this gem enough credit
Terrible lootHard to find cars if you are not in the middle of the mapCan barely have 60fpsBugs that are ruining the gameplayRandom disconnectsServers are bad
Best last man standing type of game so far
Game is hillarious when u press F while driving
This game is better than h1z1Thats all you need to know
this game pretty good i guess
iiz good
Region lock China or fix your game This is ridic I haven t played in two weeks and when I get back to it I ve been hacked 5 times in 2 days Are you kidding me  I absolutely love this game but it s being completely ruined by hackers I can deal with having people on your team that don t speak english and therefore can t communicate with the squad I can deal with a huge surge of chinese players and the lag they bring with themThis is all fine What isn t fine is BLATANT hacking in every other game where all the dudes can fly speed run see through smoke and auto aim my head through objects
Getting better still is in need of a lot of improvement
the best battle royale game
Amazing Game people buy it
excellent game
top game in the world
Looking for a good and decent game to play PUBG is one title you ll want to play Though honestly I d say mute other players that aren t your friends because main lobby is full of trolls and people screaming Other than that it s a good game
It is a very good and fun game but it can go very frustrating some timesPro     fun          MP          Good graphics          full dev supportCon   can be frustrating          Not the best optimization yet
Nothing more thrilling in gaming right now than being among the last 5 of a PUBG match Incredible if you re willing to put up with some level of jank
I m really enjoying the landspace in this game havn t had any problems yet
Great game if you re Chinese and have hacks
It s pretty fun  
Love it absolutely love it
I ve been speding 10 mins in game looting then a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing PAN HELM LVL 4 HELM LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed my life1010 mom simulator
Best game even though it s in eaarly acces Do everything as u like anythiing that can make u win So challenging
game is good just lot of bugs around but what can we do its still in early access
very exiting action filled strategy game with friends or without only thing is that the game crashes alot and i get bad fps for having a 1050 ti but they will patch it soon so if they fix that the game will be 55i recomend you buy it before they patch it or it might go up maybe 5 10 becuase also it a very popular game
PC 
nice game just a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  place to meet a chinese
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1010 would recommend this for autistic children i guess i am one
Every game I get into has a guy who bought a lifetime membership on aim warenet 40  of the matches I have played have cheaters
Very fun but also very frustrating
If you have salt in your veins and enjoy causing pain to others this is for you Cheers
 Ok guys I m going to push now    Eskomo has died

amazing battle royale game
Fantastic gameplay for those looking for a good time or to win Low skill floor to get in High skill ceiling to win WOULD RECOMMEND but bare with the early access stuff until end of 2017 7 guiness world records almost 3 million concurrent players 50 percent chinese based on steamp spy at the moment 3rd person and 1st person solo duo  and squads Game mechanics will be amazing at 10 release but if you have a low end pc don t play untl 10 version is out
_
if you like alternative shooting games you should check it out

pretty good just fix the server problems and optimization
Muito bom  um jogo que te prende jogando No tive muito tempo para joga lo porm sempre que posso tento joga loRecomendo muito
Super intense and really fun Just don t be a salty little bish and you ll have a great time
This game is sooooo fun that some times i want to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  my keyboard but its still super fun i will tell u this if u never tryed it buy it its worth the 30e
abandon all hope pray for the smallest luck
maybe the new update sh  but the game really fun
Awesome game and very fun playing with friends or aloneThe only problem is that it s laggy and some times the buildings dont load fullyI hope it gets fixed soon
One of the best games this year Just needs to be optimized the performance is pretty bad
Yey wadu hek 
I m hookedwhat can I say
Yes there may be a lot of bugs and glitches but it does not change the fact that it is a well made battle royale game that has caught millions of people s attention The combat is intense skills tactics they are all qualities you need for this game These are the aspects gamers look for in a game I believe this game can go far in the future with all the new upcoming updates Its just a matter of waiting  D
In planeDrop downGet a helmetGet killed with a headshotQuitUnInstallBest game ever
Game is greatSomething different to the normal first person shooters out thereJust a few tweaks and will be awesome
Im shocked with this gameplay it s like your in the hunger games It s amazing  Highly recommended
Great game that shows you how terrible you are at videogames
my favoritt game yas yas
Hackersfix it
Does not offer what was expected even after a year of developing
I have played almost 90 to 100 hours and today I m sick and tired of this game Everytime I shoot at enemies they turn around and headshot me The lag is also horrible AGAIN It s unplayable and no fun It s such a shame because this game could have been so much fun Please implement a working anti cheat system and regiolock servers so the Chinese hackers can t access my European gameservers I m done with this game for now unless in a few months the hackerproblem is solved and lagnetcode as well Maybe I ll be back again then
love it so match
If you haven t been to China yet this is the game for you
one of the most selfish dev team ive ever seen game never goes on sale not even once blackfriday no sale  so selfish you should be ashamed of yourselves your not that good get a grip and start giving back to your community your selfish  punks and fix your loading elements in your game u still aint fixed that loading times thats why most of us stay away from your bad loading time hot mess
I have 420 Hours on this game now and im still gonna play this game because it will get more new stuff and its about to get lit after it is completly out and for 30 Euro its nothing because you can claim free chests by playing this game and you can sell them for 40 50 Cents so you can get your money easy back  
All i can say is Ocean man take me by the hand lead me to the land that you understand Ocean man the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip Ocean man the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand Soaking up the thirst of the landOcean man can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman Ocean man the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man Ocean man the sequence of a life form braised in the sandSoaking up the thirst of the landOcean man ocean man Ocean manOcean man take me by the hand lead me to the land that you understand Ocean man the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip Ocean man the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand Soaking up the thirst of the landOcean man can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman Ocean man the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man Ocean man the sequence of a life form braised in the sandSoaking up the thirst of the landOcean man 
With each update the game seems to bring more bugs and hacks than improvements
It is the first kind of survival game that i have ever played  3
Eventhough there are still many bugs i really love this game Looking forward to the new maps and official release
the crme de la crme  buying what r you waiting for   D
Alotta fun with friends
ignore me pls
Camp in a bush all day just so I can get to top 10 and have enough money for my weekly case and end up regretting of opening it1110
It s fun sometimes It s frustrating sometimes Idk You either love it or hate it We ll just have to wait and see for 10 release Hope they fix random game crashes and errors without error  ErrorName  blank 
Live Loot Die Repeat
Winner of the Annual Biggest Hype Awards Tried it for two hours discussed it with friends watched  gameplays  and still have no clue why is this game so popular I can t deny it may be fun to watch online   once twice Hovewer gameplay is     ing dull What s my thing  It s basically Running Simulator 2017 since you spend 80   of the game transporting your LOVE LOVE LOVE  to designated location on a map so badly designed it makes Commonwealth from Fallout 4 look like an abundant oasis of good designer choices Moreover the game is partly based on luck and randomised spawn Your gamer skill kicks in after some time when you have proper equip and the gameplay area is small enough to actually meet other players Hovewer initial phase of the game  first ten minutes sometimes longer is pure boredom Yep you can drop your LOVE LOVE LOVE  at the military base with kickass action from the very beginning Yet you are most likely to be killed by someone who found a good weapon faster than you The  yaaay house what will I find inside     excitement runs out quickly and you find yourself to be running around huge empty map thinking  am I seriously wasting my time on this hiking sim   From time to time you meet someone   just to avoid them Thrill danger  Safety first Unpolished social dimension Unstable No killcam  therefore no learning from your mistakes   I fell twice without a clue what the      happened Guess it doesn t matter since the game makes money However technical issues and hackers are not the worst The main flaw of this game is it s boring
I am enjoying this game every day Sometimes there are error when I playBut It is really nice gmae
Fortnut   Thisi know this is immature but really these guys filed a suit against epic  LUL
its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  made by chinese lol
It s really bad
AwesomePUBG is the game that I got into in the shortest time Just play it
Amazingly fun even better with friends It stressful at the beggining but then you get used to it and its a pleasure to play
Very good game and none stop fun with this gmae great with friends too
It s a pretty good gamestill has a lot to do but overall it s very good
This Game Was Better Than I Expected The Game Is Smoth And It Needs Some Patches To Become A Perfect One
this game punishes you if you dont have a 3000 pc
No1 Game
You can t play this game at holidayDon t make your rating score highHigh level of rating is not the human s worldYou have to fight against the Bots lolGood Graphic  huh XD
If optimization wasn t a problem then it s my game of the year
this games not gaydont worry
 Watch out for the nuttsacks on the bridge   Bestie
Great game loved everything in it besides my teammates Cheaper than a triple AAA title less bugs and ive made all my money back on the steam market through cases Would play over H1Z1 and dorknite any day
i really really good game that s all enjoy it
worth getting into for early access content definitely worth it after 10 release no matter the cost
wtf is going on with this game these days  i get 3 crashes or so in a day   
Lol this game have a cool gameplay but at the begining is little hardAfter 34 matches you can play well
kinda buggy
E sportsready
great but bikesdeath and building some times load slowly
Git gud scrubs
love to play with all the hackers best game 1010
Killer Killer Chicken Dinner  
best horror game of 2017
Never before have I played a multiplayer game this long that only has one map to offer This is the type of game you play with friends and almost every match will play out in different ways This really keeps it fresh It s a powerful thing when the game has so many faults The lack of variety jank no shortage of cheaters ridiculous loot box systems all would be the death knell of most games However PUBG manage to keep everyone playing That s a special game
It might be an early access game and it has a lot of bugs But if you have some friends to play with this game is awesome 1010
Update  Had a game in a duo where we could have won   only 8 left  Hacker comes out 1 shots everyone left alive with an S12K  Game is still trashUpdate  2 months later Game is still garbage  Graphics from 10 years ago runs like from 20 years agoDon t support this company   They re busy trying to put this game on XBox when it still runs like trash on PC   So I like the idea of this game a lot I like how much better it is than the Day Z sh t I tried a long time ago  There s still many infuriating things about this game that make me want to say to not waste your time1 LAG  Oh my god is this game laggy  At the beginning you can barely pick up any loot  It s random if you re going to hit anyone  Throughout the game it seems like everything will just miss when my shots are right on2 Players   I m not terrible at FPS but I can t kill anyone for sh t in this game  I swear it s lag as CSGO is fine and I don t really have too much of a problem and I feel fairly average  The amount of random headshots is too damn high3 Hackers   there s so many  I try reporting who knows if it does anything4 LAG  Again this is so infuriating  5 FPS   this game is so demanding  I can play all other games on high settings with   75fps on the highest settings with my GTX970  This game especially lately I sometimes get 40 sometimes 75  I have the settings on mostly mediumPeople might be better off spending their time doing something else I usually wonder why did I waste a couple hours playing this game
Great game in my opnion
Good game but so many cheaters
Its a great all round game
I have never ever had my heart get to 160 bpm while sitting down before getting to my first game of PlunkBat with the blinking   2 Players  in the top right corner That was so intense I had to take a 15 min break to breathe before I could play again
Play the game Drop somewhere crowded Get a gun Die because you re bad at the game Repeat the cycle
Pretty good
best multiplayer game of the year
if you like playing games at about 8fps then this is the game for you 010
terrible game badly optimized awful hitreg guns are like bullet sponge dreams cant actually get a good game without vietnamese people invading it yeah sums everything about this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game up so enjoy the game for the next week of lifespan it has when fortnite LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all over it with new updates gg no re
This is game is pretty good i guess I enjoy all the shooting and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but it s too slow
Muy bien
Game crashes no matter how good your pc is dont buy trust me 
Really a good game  D
pan is god
The short game play time is the key of the successIt s gonna be worth playing as long as the loyal fan base exists
It is a pretty good game considering it is still in early access It still has to be optimized though I have a great computer but still don t get very good fps
This game is pretty good without hackers
I think that what makes this game great is that it has tight rules It makes it interesting to play and very rewarding to win it   chickendinner  It has bugs but it overall is pretty stable game I have known dinal release games which are not as stable as this specially in multiplayer  this only has multiplayer
hunters gay and plays this so obviously its good
Play for hours and play with noobs smh
It s cool buy it like right now you re missing out
When I first played this game I didn t like it Was it buggy  A little but it is early access Was it too complex  Nope the idea is simple What was it that I didn t like about it then  I sucked at it Plain and simple I couldn t be a run and gun spray and pray gun wielding maniac It took all of my experience in FPS and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  all over it and screamed at me  You are a noob  I was affronted and left it in my library like an old book that didn t captivate me in the first few chaptersSome time later I came back to it and boys and girls was I glad I did I came at it from a more mature approach This game was about strategy and survival About thinking and out thinking 99 other players Now admittedly I don t play solo It doesn t do it for me but I love duos and squad play is a good bit of fun too It challenges me stresses me frustrates me and urges me to do better And when you taste the sweet sweet victory and experience your first chicken dinner it makes all the hours worth it Highly recommend this game for people who like a challenge and can accept that they won t win every single game
Very immersive and detailed world with eight kilometers for a giant battle royal with a maximum amount of people of 100
During Firday evenings or on a weekend keeps constantly telling me  Servers are too busy try again later  What am I paid for 
Join a lobby to engage in a suspensful war about china being number 1 before entering a plane to drop into a map with 99 other players and fight to the death for a chicken dinner
as of writing this i havent even got my first solo win but all the same i still love it there is a luck part to the game when trying to find loot and some rounds it just feels like the game hates me but others it feel amazing this game is my one of the best shooters i know and if you havent got it yet well see you on the Battlegrounds  if that wasnt clear i am telling you not to wait any longer and just click that Add to Cart button you will not regret it  D
I am just writing this review to get my award   Game is sometimes fun
5 10 fps
After 379 hours of playing this game I m writing my first Steam review ever It is because I want to tell people that I don t recommend this gameat all The only good thing about this game is the principle of it the Battle Royale It s so much fun to be placed on an Island with 99 other players and fight over the first place It s so intense and no other game I have played  and I played a LOT has ever offered me this experience But that s it PUBG looks bad it sounds bad  with a few exceptions and it plays as bad as no other game in my 20 years history of gaming The real problem is the servers which makes this game next to unplayable They said they would improve the servers but they did nothing It didn t change ONE BIT since May 2017 and being close to release of version 10 it s save to say that there will not be any improvements I can t even begin to describe the tons of times I died because of lag desync and co Sometimes you don t even know how you got killed at first until your mate tells you what happened because he observed itand you can t believe it because you experienced it totally differentBy the time a bigger developer creates one of those Battle Royale games with working servers this game is gonna die faster than you can say  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  By the state of this game it would be plain stupid to buy it Yes I bought it toocall my naiv because I believed in Bluehole because they had soooooo many sales and thus  But now I have to admit that I was wrong and I just want to warn people that think that  maybe they should give it a try  Don t Watch streams and wait Until these server issues remain don t buy this piece of code LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t
This is easily the best battle royale game on Steam Hands down
Don t let Tencent buy you will let many people in China do not play this game
1010 I died
Great game So much fun
The developers are literally focusing on adding other maps and just added the new  fog mode  instead of focusing on optimalizing their gameok
The game is fun but you can get cancer really easily from it XD
I m only eating ckicken
Good Game for Early Access needs vaulting fix the gas so you can t see through it to stop kills from outside to inside play zone and reverse
100
feels more like a beta than a 30 game
The royal rumble
You jump out of a plane and get shot before you get a chance to land or defend yourself BRILLIANT Awsome game
Should be renamed to running simulator 2017 or looting simulator 2017 But still pretty good
5
sick sick
Have over 1000 hours in this game Probably my favorite game of all time
still better than h1z1
fun lol
Pogchamp
Best 2017 realeased game 
Being in the circle is half the battle
When a game that is in its Alpha Stage of development has four times more players than the second most played game  which FYI is free to play at any given time you know its going to be a good game
quality meme
EDIT  NEVERMIND THERES A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  TON OF CHEATERS NO LOL GOOD LUCK GETTING A CHICKEN DINNER M8Great game currently being review bombed due to hackers which I dont think is fair because you rarely do see hackers and the game is still really fun when there arent hackers as for optimization I wouldnt get this game on a laptop or any other machine without a GPU an you probably want a GTX 770Getting around 100fps on 980tiRyzen 1600 tho so Its not too badOverall 910 gameplay 610 Gfx 1010 replayability
Overall this game is a ton of fun to play with friends You can try extremely hard or just play casually and it is still enjoyable both ways People seem to get annoyed at the down time in the game that comes with the looting but this is mostly just a problem for Competitive Tournaments I played DAYZ a lot and it feels good to loot up and then actually be able to fight someone Updates for this game also happen quite often and it is obvious they are working hard on it I definitely recommend this game if you enjoy playing H1Z1 DayZ or any online shooter game
Nice work
The only thing I learned from this is CHINA NUMBER 1
this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    fix my rendering issues
E sports rdy your Graphics Card isn t
Love it  
best game i ever seen
 Be looting crate Nobody around feelsgoodmanjpg hear car No problem I m behind the crate Car hits crate 81001010 would play again
just Amazing it is hard but worth it
Wadu Heck 
ily
only da best memery allowed
not happy with the game I would like to back my money back
It might not be the best optimized game but after many patches you can get decent fps with an average PC  60fps The biggest issue with this game is server speed   capacity Miramar map looks nice but its too big Clothing spawns just got removed but trash items like quickdraw magz pistolshotgun attachments are still in the game This game shouldnt be a looting stimulator Flashbangs are still useless
Game of the Year 2017
Fun to play intense moment when your the last man in a squad and get a chicken dinner Some parts of this game iis flawed buy much else makes up for them love the realism too Can t wait to see what updates come next
Too focused on new guns and other things that don t really matter The game is still a buggy mess and patches don t offer much in enhancing the playability of the game  3Post cont March 7 2018eSports Ready All bugs are now features Good luck even getting into a game on your first try Have we mentioned we still have not increased our server capicity but you will never notice because people stopped playing our game  Also Please agree to our EULA that states that we aren t responsible if our shoddy coding manages to fry your computer or damage some other piece of hardware within it
ESports ready
How can movement and shooting done poorly in FPSThx devs
PubG is really fun to play with some friends and it s a game that anyone can grasp and excel in due to the multiple ways of playing It takes some time initially to learn and understand but it can be very rewarding when you finally get that Chicken Dinner
Best Survival Shooter yet  Developers do not dissapoint and work on the Game
A game where you can fly through the big range of the emotion rainbow
With 1400 I can tell ya this game is legendary and is only going to get better The updates for V10 looks very promising and will definitely add a different style of playing The devs do take issues head on when they arise and try their best to resolve it in the fastest way possible To enjoy the game and be able to play as long as I do I would get friends on as well as getting into discord server and have fun with others 1010You ll read in the reviews about hackers I haven t seen any or was to oblivious to notice any However don t let that stop you from getting this game and support the devs to continue with this fine piece of art
Nicely doneNicely doneee
Toxic but k
Great game Does have some glitches but still worth playing
Literally unplayeble for the first 5 mins of the game
One of my best gamesRecommended for everyoneWeapons realistic Game design is awesome
kova peli
Spent many hours playing this game Definitely one that haunts me even in my sleep For all you players who own this game you guys know what I m talking about The adrenaline pumping moments when you finally make a kill find awesome loot survive for a considerable amount of time whereby you can smell the fragrance of the chicken dinner  only to be killed by a bulletvehiclepan from out of nowhere    Definitely get this game
very good game died from an m249 cheater on top of a mountain 1010 would kys again
Better than DayZ
A quite expensive game for Early Access however it s worth it in my opinion
The best fkin game everrrrr i see a very big community and a big platform for this game in the future if the company doesn t give up can be better than even dota in terms of having unique players
This game can be frustrating even infuriating when it comes to the sheer luck some people can haveWether it s loot  you finding a machete VS their M4 Skill   When you carefully take the aim to predict their movement then they suddently changes directions whne you take the shot to follow up with a 180 degress back breaker with a quick pop to your domeThe circle litterally being place as far away from you as humanly possible and much moreBut in the end the feeling when you finally have everything sorted and you get that chicken dinner there is no feeling like itWell except when you and an enemy somehow downs eachother at the same time and you are left in a meme ish orgy for the next minute or so until someone s teammate bursts through the door and kills both of you out of trigger happiness that is pretty funny too
Got shot in the head while looting 1210
DropGet a Vest a Helm an AK a First Aid KitFully equippedGood feelingGet killed by a PanRageRepeat1010 would die again
Today after a few weeks I again played and I noticed that the end is not  network lag and it is more fun to play
Keeping the optimizationhitreg and desync issues aside PUBG is super fun to play with friends Highly Recommended
Play with your friends Much more laughter you can get if you play with friends Great to pass time with but stressful if you meet hackers in game
Game mechanics are greattextures are goodAnd the game itself is fantasticeven if u r playing with friends or solo1110
GuT GaMe Is NiCe U gEt VeRy MaD bUt Is Oke h oke 
the ultimate in early access games
Awesome game but its still full of bugs
nice game pretty overpriced imo
Potato PC can t runUse Microwave instead 910
Even for early access this game is pretty well polished and just plain fun to play  No 2 rounds are the same and no single strategy works every time  Chicken never tasted so good
Great Battle Royal game  You can play this game how you want Slowly hiding in busheshouses or aggressive land at the school and go balls out  You also can play slow early game and find a car and go super aggroAlthough i recommend this product i do have to say its still early access and they have lots of work to do before its completely ready  The Devs do update quite a bit and i have high hopes they wont fall into the h1z1 1000 year Early Access Game
I personally love this gameI recomment to those who like survival games
buggy broken stupid but worth it
This game is one of many Battle Royale games that actually has sense to it even though it may not sometimes but i still think it s much better than H1Z1
This game is like a pr0n videoYou find the perfect teammates but then if the match is over u don t ever get to play with them againLike u find a really good video and then u cannot find it ever back again6910 Would get an erection again
Extremely well made game itself but poorly optimised for mid low range pc setupsRegion lock China please   _   every 3rd player is chinese and the language is not native to most of us n they be like  Chiinaah Numbaa Won  xD  Please try to fix this and try to introduce more maps  and new weapons every 2nd update or so
One has to take PHD in CSGO to play this game with hackers or else do the same
is fun and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game simultaneously but makes me want to kill myself
Still early access wow
This game is one of if not the best battle royale game with decent graphics good weapons andgood game physics
very nicei like to play this with my friend
Game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and you always die to your team m8 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE inng boosted banobos
extremely well made game BTW
Really enjoying this game so far and the updates for full release are going to be insane Definetly pick this up if you want something to play that has no concequences if you leave
Pros  Great gameplay Constant action Great to mess around withCons  Beta game minor and major bugs some annoyancesall in all a game that is in development and a lot can still change 710
Better than i expected  D
_
Needs to have more people in every game
fUN
this game is another hunger games game that in my opinion is better then Fortnite i would save up yo buy it
best battle royal in centuries
fun game with shity optimisation i recommend for those who have pretty beafy pc s
The best battle royale game ever
I shoot my guns in residential areas
Launch GameLand PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE iDie to RedzoneWould drop again 1010
One of the most captivating games of all times I m glad to be apart of the game that changed gaming history
hahaha no just no
Somewhat meh somewhat nice
I have been LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed because of  this games optimization and servers After this new update the bags and problems became even more game sucks even after early access Of course they fixed some problems but there is a lot of thing to do to make this game playable So the problem is that you can t play with normal graphics even with good PC
really good game for practising your driving skill
This game is fun and nice looking however it s very random and requires goot specs on your system to run it
Very many nice game
nice nice
Just can t get enough of this game 1010 and devs always pushing futher
The updates are ineresting
Test server is better than the main game I recomend both though
Very nice  D
run little boy run
im happy to have this game and more happy if you survive from 90 or more people who play with you in the same time LOL
very gut game  lot of choises  65
Very good gameFun to play with friends
Too much cheating go into the hall and hear people playing information about cheating In addition the server is difficult to connect in often broken bugs in the program often app crashbug
Optimization must be more developted Today is 2442018 and for today optimization is literally LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Its gotten alot better with recent updates Still a go to game regardless of the negative feedback from ninja fans
I didn t have a gf when I started playing this in beta and I still don t
so many hack and cheat
Good game worth the money
Not worth the timeOh wait A Kar98
For how successful this game is  its LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing stupid how the format of the game works Firstly when i entered a lobby there were ads playing in the background I cant believe they put ads in a full price game thats not even finished yet Also you need a pre good pc if u want to play Graphics looks like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  unless its highultra
Definitely Worth the 30
It s fun but don t play with the low speed internet
Very good game I think that it is good how they took an armar approach 1010 IGN
pre good i gessss but im addicted
Cool LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ever
Neat game getting them dinners is always a fun time
Broken but still worth to play with squad
I recommend this product  to complete the thing with the nomination cards with Steam and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a couple of reasons   I never LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  myself so much in a game than in PUBG solo when thunder strikes or when a player sneaks up on me in the mist and spreads his shotgun in my face  I never laughed so much than when playing with friends arguing that  YES IT S SAFE TO GO THERE  while driving hitting a small bump go full tumble in air 720 nose grab land the perfect landing go in a nice drift and get shot point blank range by another group who was just waiting there and probably went all  THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  WAS THAT   before going full auto in our faces  but that s ok because in that other game we got the last of our team going with a grenade in hand rushing the remaining guys of the team that destroyed us 30 seconds ago THAT ONE WAS SATISFYING   http steamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetails id1164038284 Yeah it s good fun
lovely game  D worth to try tbh
Good game to put in a few hours
This game would be good without all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bugs
Buggy but still pretty goodFix it bruh
VERY NOICE GAME 
Good Game hard on hackers
A very good survival game It s skill and luck based so even if u play it rarly u can make it in the top 10 I would say give it a try It s worth it
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE in bugs smh

Need Optimization for mid end pc
Sometimes I don t know what s more disappointing this game s development or finding a bike and then realising it s a 3 seater
How you even supposed to play the game when the buildings won t load 1010 would not render buildings again
this game so good 
B E S T       G A M E         E V E R
too many cheaters and bugs pls fix this
This game simply the best Very pleased about efforts of developers to add new features
In the words of Jerry Smith   Huh I like it 
It s freaking amazing
kkkkoihj
though unoptimised this game is fun to play
So addictive the best game so far I wish i had better pc
Hackers every 2 games
Probably the best bang for buck game I have bought in a while and with the loot crates it is more rewarding and hek even allowed me to sell enough items to buy  the game for a friend too
Oh very nice
too good game
Best game 2k17
We E Sports ready boys But for real this game is addicting as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I love dropping in and battling for my life with a pistol or straight up using my fists I can t wait to see what the developers push in every patch and can t wait for the future
OMG  this is a kind of game which you should definitely play before you diesavage level game strategy  the game literally controls your heartbeat
Fun Game 1010 ESports Ready
good game ever  
POOPY DICKY
Love the Game But hate is just as much as it is frustrating sometimes
1000  better than h1 and fortshit i have not dealt with hackers yet and i ve got 350 hours of course there will be problems with optimization and sure some hackers not saying they don t exist cause i can easily look on the leaderboard but they are not prevalent in the game just because you got outgunned or outplayed doesn t mean that person is hacking own up and take a death you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE esi guess this isn t a review of the game but more of a rebuttal to the idiots who claim this game is filled with hackers it s just simply not the caseas for the game if you are interested in a battle royale type of game this is the one to get there s a learning curve which should be expected
Good game but I m only writing this review for the steam badge
Muito Bom Pikaaa
A challenging game that is mostly very fun and entertaining to play If you want to play duo or squad I suggest you to crab some friends with you There are as many salty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s playing this game as in any other online game You might feel uncomfortable But with friends GGPROS  Interesting gameplay  tactics shooting teamwork  A sort of realistic weapon handling when comparing with generic shooters  eg COD BF  Chicken dinner tastes very good  sense of accomplishment when winning  Regular updates are improving this game all the timeCONS  No modding  Custom matches are only for PUBG partners  Success based too heavily on luck  Bad optimization  Awful tickrate when compared to most nowadays games  Lack of other gamemodes than BR on public servers
Looking for a game that you will love and hate but still want to keep playing  Then this is  your game
bad servers good game
SeemsGood
This game will waste a lot of your life and your sanity    You will equally love and hate this game  You will want to set aside a lot of free time you will need itThis game needs map selection the new map is garbage
Mute chat and it s a good game
waw
please stop updating  i really love the game but when i open to play the game it  the first thing is see is updating  stop updating daily   hope you understand  
first battle royal game ever whick i liked most
It s fun Get some friends and play it
Pretty good as of now just needs more optimization for better fps and an upgrade to the servers and it will be one of the best fps games out
dfadaswfasdfsafsadqgaf
Frustrating and awesomeand frustrating
koreans are god at this game somehow
cant dislike as the game is still in beta
This game is great actually but still needs some fixings Anything else is working perfectly I think
 APOLOGIZE MOST  AWARD
Useless talk we can eat chiken dinner that is all
ooppss
buggy but pretty fun
HANDS DOWN MY FAV GAME ON PC
I hate you I love you
It s fun
THIS GAME IS SUPER AWESOME I LOVE THIS GAME
jh
I like trains
Ignore the haters of this game You play H1Z1  Just add more money man just a little and play the daddy s version of H1Z1
Awesome game and it is most enjoyable when you play it with your friends
I love dying by hitting a bump the size of my thumb on a stunt bike and then flying 300 meters on my head1010
Games breaks sometimes but enjoyable all the same
Really really fun with friends easy to win if yall are good at fps games and aren t stupid 910 i think it would be a 1010without microtranactions Dont play solos there really boring and there are a bunch of cheaters and teamers
This is one of the best shooters I have ever played By far better than the new Call Of Duty
Like open world scavenging and pvp as much as I do  Then you came to the right place
Version 10 is very good
Just need more improvement  D
I never get chicken dinner but this game is Awesome 
ive had this game since it came out i prefer far more than h1z1 unfortunatly there has been a huge increase in hackers and i mean huge the issue is they dont even hide it ether each game youll see people speed hacking around usually screaming some obsurdity over public chat Normally theres always some but its gotten to the point where  the game is unplayable before you buy it go watch a streamer and youll see them ether hacking themselves or getting killed
worth a money u pay
Waduhek    
too many china men and people calling me the N word overwall goodgame
I have 85 games in my library rookie numbers I know but after I ve bought this game I can t play anything else
best  non game of the year
best thing ever
Solid game that has some major issues at the moment Whenif they get fixed it would be a 100  recommend RIght now it s a cautionary recommend
addicted to play
This game makes me cry myself to sleep It s good but jeez lol
200 hours in and I m still trash but you know what I love this game  I ve been lucky enough to have only fallen pray to  hackers  a couple times  Actually killed a couple speed hackers in duo s pretty funny  Game crashes at least a couple times a week fluctuates between 90 144fps  It s a demanding game a hot mess the crazy girlfriend  It s like an exclusive club in that regard like a 90 s supercar  Big bucks to get into unreliable as hell but boy sure is funI ve got some wins quite a few top 10s and a pile of losses  Casual hardcore whatever play how you want  It ll be a rush everytime Worth itPS   I ve also purchased and racked up hours and wins on xbone and if I could go back I would refund the xbone version absolute garbage  As a last resort if you can t get this on PC play the MOBILE version of the game  Yea I said it

Mom s spaghetti
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Management  every time i play so many laggs Doesnt worth is money
PUBG is one of these games where it s nothing unusual when you have   100h
Solid game i would say sometimes movement seems sluggish but not a whole lot to complain about would love to see a practice range where you could test weapons out
O jogo ainda no est bem otimizado seu tempo de renderizao  longo e isso atrapalha muito a jogabilidade mas depois de uma ou duas partidas j carrega bem melhor
Best game I got this Year

BAD GAME
Why the hell cant I get into a game with english speaking people 
This game have a big problem every upate is just BUG fixing so that means is BROKENThere s no way that a game is just trying to be fix for a year LOLTry other BattleRoyale some of them have NEW content every week NOT PUBG
PUBG  Fortnite
Would definitely recommend awesome game and lots fun even if youre coming in to the game solo or with your friendsCons  Not very well optimised occasional hackers
One of the best FPS games I ve ever played The tension is palpable

You see those hours I invested  Just enough time to realise this game is exactly what everyone said it is Bugs and Hackers Came back to reviews to see if any of this has improved Looking at Steam Youtube and Twitch I would have to say absolutely not Thanks for the refund Someday if they improve the issues the game has maybe Ill cough it up again
      LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE        2    LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE           LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE            
Let s be honest this game is overrated
Its shtI played this game to much and im not happy that i wasted my time on this game and not on something funProblems  The third person is just unfair and the first person looks crappy af The map is way to big The most terrible feeling is to loot for 10 minutes and then to get snipped form 1 km away Realy the map is way to big And there are more problems but i just want to play a fun game so i don t realy want to finish the review xDSo pls don t buy
TRASH 
PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is one of the best if not the best battle royale games it has a large variety of weapons  exclusive in drop only weapons  not p2w just in game it has greats elements of gameplay like leaning the game is being updated frequently with new weapons functonalities better UI design ect And this game is ONLY in early access and the 10 will come out soon with 2 new weapons vaulting ectPros  Best mechanics so far Weapons are pretty much balanced a lot of weapon variety  meleeARSniper RifleLMGSMGCrossbow  1st map well designed A lot more to come on the game being updated Duo and Squad mode First Person Perspective servers for those who hate 3rd personCons  The game can be very frustrative  bad loot sometimes a little bit of lag and the ways that you can die The servers aren t this good but handle the job pretty much  heavy lag sometimes 3rd person can be OP sometimes  If not playing in FPP obviouslyOverall  A nice game that you can play with your friends in duo or squad maybe hard to have fun in solos but it s always nice to get a chicken dinner  D
most relaxed game ever
Of course the game in its current state has flaws  but the game itself is epic Plus who doesn t like getting pushed across the map on a motorcycle when touching a wall
It s a really good game it can get you angry sometimes when you do not find the right loot but overall pretty fun game to play with friends you can have some really good laughs while playing this
Awesome
Figure out your freaking hacking issues and region lock China This game used to be playable but now it crashes at least 3 times a day It seems like with every update this game goes further down the trash They re more focused on cosmetics and making sure  your breathing  is more reactive to what s going on Why does that matter  Fix your game already This is why people are leaving in flocks to play fortnite even though that game is trash                                    
Goooood game
pew pew bang bang dead and we start over again
Dev is a jew Game is never on sale
Can t play  just Loading Screen and then CRASH  nice game
What is the sense in playing this freaking  gameif there is no satisfactory and reasonable optimization Anywaynot gonna stop playingbut i just  wanted to speak it out
A game where people have guns that go skrrrahh pap pap ka ka ka Skidiki pap pap and a pu pu pudrrrr boom Skya du du ku ku dun dun Poom poom

Incredible game Ive never had a game experience like this Im hooked Highly recommend
In it for ta badge but gg
so gut game
Badges
Its has its problems but its still early release At this point they re still working on it and it seems to be coming along If you re looking for polished then this isnt the game for you If you able to laugh at game play when a buggy is driving through walls and hitting people or getting head shot from halfway across the map in the fog then this game will be a lot of fun for you
I love this game I really do Only issue I have with it so far from my playthrough was the frame rates They are terrible and hope for it to be fixed Other then that its really fun as squads and honestly haven t gone through any hackers yet Once they add the kill cam features it may be easier to find hackers in this gameAlso PLEASE I hope the name change feature comes soon

Fun but not worth 30 bucks Maybe 15 at best Still fun tho
This game is insanely good really like the gamemode  D
If they optimize the game the game can be way better than what it is rite now
could be better
This game is so much better than I expected Love it

this is vary good review just for the awards i gotta get dem good moms spaghtti is vary goodits good game cus i play itand i dont like when i get kar98 to mah face
The amount of hackerscheaters in this game is ridiculous Reporting does nothing and the creator acts like we re xenophobes for wanting region locks Get rid of the hackers or at least make SOME notable effort to do so and maybe people will stop demanding region locks How could I recommend this game if the devs don t do anything to ensure fair play   Hey Friend You should definitely play this game You get to spend like 10 minutes looting and preparing for survival and epic firefights just to be killed by hackers in 9 out of 10 games  not a great sales pitch
Don t go to school today
Honestly cheaters especially chinese cheaters ruin the game as I expected
THE BEST EARLY ACCES GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED
hype af
Exellent game that is still in early accessThis game will be even better after the official releaseQuite fun playing alone even beter playing along with friends whether you only want to make trouble or want to play to win1010 no regrets on buying the game

What is PUBG Can someone pls help me is this truck simulator 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game still love it
Coming from a similar game called ARMA III I can say that they did well in terms of making it into an arcade simulator It sounds contradicting but once you play it   it gives the sense of realism in an increasingly fast paced game
That feeling when you win games is banging anyone that says they hate the game is cause they get killed once they land for being terrible
The game is absolutely addictive and offers a great deal of time specially when playing with friends
First game i played I landed on top a school died to a shotgun and bled out while players danced around me1010
I can t say this is a very fun or well made game I think the only reason it s as popular as it is is because it s popular
after 500h 1442018  i say this is prealfa versioncheaters devs dont care at all bugs hitbox detection is total garbage and its not working its the worst i ever saw  but u can buy nice S  T for your char
eh perdido la capacidad auditiva 1010 IGN
Quite a good game some bugs but that is to be expected from a game in alpha hoping to see full version released soon with improved optimisation
It s pretty amazing buy it
e
hackers laggy servers but lots of fun play with friends and you will have a great time Can be demanding at times but still very fun and competetive
Verry nice game fun to play with friends and also solo s are good to
Good game to play with friends Needs optimization tho
PRAISE THE PAN
this game is so good
The game itself is overrated but it is worth the 2999 euro
The best game i ever seen so far kappa
best game in the world nothing wrong just STOP HAVEING CHINESE PLAYERS ON NA SERVERS
nice game survival ever
It s a great game bugs come around but the team is profiecient to fix themThe problem The game is currently cheater infested
to buggy they are adding skins but they dont fix bugs
Come
10 out of 10 game wolud recommend to everybody
ok but waiting for update
PUBG is getting better and better with each release I can t wait for 10 as the changes look awesome Even through i am playing from a country that does not have servers as of yet it is still my go to game each and every nightSomething has to happen to the hackers on the game though It is bad sometimes and you know when you get taken out behind a wall while trying to med upBring on the kill cam
Would not recommend it for now because there is so many hackers and bug  early access stuff But the main problem is hackers idk how do I write this 
PUBG will have you comming back time   again every match is different and will force you to use different tactics every time
Nice game but need some bug fixes and also need a good configuration to play
this game has a lot to love right now
i Cannot click anythingin pubg plz bug
PUBG is truly a tactical strategic Battle Royale game but cheaters and bugs making this game look crapy
WADUHEK
I NEED MY MONEY BACK 
The game is great It never seems to lose its appeal and is especially fun with friends The top negative reviews right now however are partially correct There are loads of cheaters and some optimizaiton issues but the devs are tirelessly working to fix those
this game is awesome sometimes the textures is broken but this game is fantastic
After they fixed some major lagging and bugs this game is pretty ok
Werygood giem
very nice 10memes Best quality REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

55 doesn t get better than this fortnite wishes it was this good
good and funn game
so much funny when play with friend
Worth every penny 
Honestly a very enjoyable game Needs optimization and a bit more moderating as the playerbase is extremely toxic but the games itself is funUnfortunate hacker problem though not personally experienced myself  will update here if I come across some but many users reporting that they are constantly in games so beware
Make it easy Hard but FUN
258 hours and I am not sure if I give this a  Yes or a No Yeah it has flaws a lot of flaws And hackers Yeah it has hackersBut still it manages to be fun
good fun I still havent gotten a chicken dinner
super awesome optimise optimise optimise
Yeah it has bugs Still a fun game tho
Servers are too busy
This game is bloody ridiculus there re always bugs and cheaters and the bloody blue hole do not fix it
23rd of November 2017 Only getting better easy 1010 once the servers are fixed15th of Feburary 2018 Servers still not fixedconstantly shot round corners can t even pick the map you want   seriously how hard is it to allow the user to pick what map they want to play  41013th of April 2018  Server performance has got significantly better new game modes map and more content is great STILL can t choose what map we want hackers still prevelant spectator cam inaccurate etc Overall the game is getting better but still not where it should be 6510

You have died from falling simulator 2017
I m not a usual Battle Royal player but this game is perfect for my play style ARMA is too  hard core  for meH1Z1 is too arcadeish for mePUBG fits right in between those two and it is really well doneLooking forward to the next month to see how the game turns out when it is finally released as PC V10100  worth the price tag
Update 12 ________________________________________________________________New weapon balance decently spread the power across smgardmr vs just ar being opMap selection is great I thought that the matchmaking for Miramar would take longer because all the crybabies that do not like it but seem that 200 loud idiots do not speak for the whole communityHave not been killed by actual cheaters as of late  some questionable shots but legit after investigation Not Fortnite             x                                                                                                            Fortnite Update 10 ________________________________________________________________New bluezone changes have changed the pacing of the game from a tactical shooter to a run and gun garbagefireNew circle speeds make sense on the 4x4 map Erangel or Miramar inb4  hurr camper git goodi am not a patient man i CAN NOT sit in one place more than  2minTo think this fixes camping would make you an idiot Campers gonna camp they will just land in the middle find a house and sit Circle moving faster 3km away from their building does not affect their  skill  at all Not Fortnite                                                                   x                                                      Fortnite

Amazing game
This game really has it all   Plenty of russian amigos to keep you company   A town named PoLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i where all the parties get started  100 ping   Cardboard textures
Good
I saw this game announced some time ago and I was pretty hyped but seeing the streams and videos didn t make me buy it instantly When I had the occasion I gave it a try and I was pretty impressed and satisfied by that game Despite the movement bugscar mechanics  not so realistic physics and kinda unfairly distributed currency in team games I still continue playing this game with my friends and even solo because it has potential and I recommend it to anyone in doubt of buying it
Played on the test server and the updates and optimisations are 100x better I can now run this game on ultra with constant 60 80 fps  Used to run on lowest settings at 50fps It s getting closer to being an actual finished game with less bugs Lots of changes and UpdatesCan t wait for the game to be out of early access
Recommended if you enjoy the following 1 Cancerous screaming and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  hip hop playing the whole time on spawn island 2 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing up landing on roofs because the buildings haven t rendered yet and you have 3 fps 3 A Finding LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  loot and getting to top 10 with it or B finding really good loot and dying from a motorbike 4 Bullet randomly pasting your brain from some unknown direction while you
Too easy for me always first
Honestly it can be rather buggy sometimes plus fps drops are more frequent than I wish However it is still one of the best games I ve ever played The complete randomness of what can happen each game really helps keep the game fresh as no two games are the same for me The developers are also constantly adding new content and trying to fix whatever issues they find as well All in all needs a bit more work but definitely worth playing
Running simulator 2017 1 Jump from the plane2 loot for 10 min3 run for 10 min because the zone is on the complete other side of the map and there is no car to be found4 get damaged by the zone and survive purely on bandaging your arm5 enter the zone with a scram of health left praising the gods you didn t die6 get shot in the back by someone who came in later then you7 repeat untill you want to die IRL
It s basically a PANdemic outbreak
This game is  never seen  and fun But please take care of hackers all around
PROS   Very fun when playing with friends good laugh  trolling people with voice chat  people are so  united Cons   fps variation different location fps might drop or rise  mechanics kinda bad  Its okay just an alpha game  sound quality bad misleading sometimes  gets rekt when parachuting damn kinda feels bad  if you honk at a streamer and say beep beep you can get banned   producers kinda side with streamers so yea bad game for peasants
It s fun with friends
Nice game so far ban more hackers add more guns 
Unlimited tactics and strategies development still not finished and already awesome
better than csgocsgo cant walk underwall or run in 140kmh speed
Fun heart pounding stuffNeeds a few tweeks but still great
PUBG is the most competitive game I ve ever played even more so than playing mario kart with friends Despite recent reviews being mixed or negative I see no reason to write a negative review about this game   For the moment it does seem to be poorly optimized but the game is in early access and the developers have promised to have this fixed  to some extend in a few weeks But hey I love the crap out of the Fallout series but those games are also poorly optimized In that case we are talking about games that take 5 6 years perhaps more in development before release and it s still poorly optimized  I ve never encountered a hacker but that is perhaps because I m low ranking and playing in the EU  I mostly hear complains about hackers in NA and Asia Nevertheless I believe those that complain about said hackers and I wish there would be more done about it because I don t want this game to lose its playerbase  I can t say that I enjoy playing this game solo so for the most part I play it in duo  as 2 players in a team or squads  3 4 players in team It is a lot of fun to play with friends but only being able to enjoy it in duo or squads has its down sides For example I will have to wait for my friends to finish schoolwork etc to play the game Therefore even though I ve hade the game for about 2 3 months I ve only played it for about 76 hours There isn t much that the developers can do about that its just the nature of the game  There is of course the matter of lag spikes which is infuriating but those seem to be the worst in the beginning  roughly first 4 5 minutes of the game I ve heard the reason being that in the beginning there are about 100 players online but in those 4 5 minutes about 20 players  often more die and the number of players drop which subsequently results in a more more managable lag Also as part of the optimization update the developers have promised a brighter future in terms of a more stable connection  Yes it is extremely competitive Dying in the first 5 10 minutes can suck a lot or going 5 rounds without a single kill may be discouraging You will however become better with each round In 99  of the cases you die in PUBG it s because the opposing playerteam had an advantage over you  higher ground better cover etc or is simply better than you A large part of this game is to develop a strategy to plan and  when playing in teams to co operate and communicateI thoroughly enjoy this game it is the best online FPS I ve played and hopefully the game will get even better in the near future
It s a fun blast if you take it for what it is
SOOOOOO LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GARBAGE Do you like d synce  Then this is your game Enjoy the fun times of getting ran over by a Vehicel with no sound

It s alright

Game of the year of 2017 and its kinda buggy but is very awesome game you will not regret buying this game
Dispite it s flaws this game is worth the money Most people complaining are just passionate about it and most likely have logged lots of hours This game will manage to hold your attention and selfishly absorb all your free time While most battle royal games offer fun gameplay this one focuses on realism and does a good job at delivering on it

Hours of fun better with friends Semi competitive depending on what game mode you re playing Solo Duo Squads100  Reccomend if you have the money and have a fairly decent CPU
No optimisationBut still fun to play for a while
YEs veruy nice game for playing with friends Altought u get more kicks whne you plauy solo and are in the top cifcrrel Winning in squads gives me no good feelinng anymore but  in solos i get the twist its liek a drug man
lel for the nomination
This game is pretty dapper
I like the mode of this game but this game is very bad Fxck the blue hole This  shxit game heyblue hole go fxck your self
Killed two people with one pan 1010 IGN Ps It s only as fun as your friends  3
This game is awesome Yes there are some bugs but because it s early access doesn t mean that you need to hate it now
Run around and look for enemies and then one shoots you in the back of the head when they appear out of the blue zone behind you
Great gamesome optimisation and balancing required  Hackers need to be resolved
Best game of 2017 by far no doubt about that You have cheaters in any game doesn t make this game less fun Not for me at least Buy this game to play DUOS best mode in the game If only the optimization was decent If your PC is crap don t buy the game Also the biggest reason why i m not playing this game a lot Anyway it s worth the money  D
No hack  Fun
is fun best with your friends tbh
                                                                            
Fun game to play with or without friends gives a good challenge trying to avoid both bullets disconnections and crashes  Prepare to choke your computer because this bad dad requires some serious RAM to deal with occasional memory leaksIt is a fun game and I would reccommend supporting devs to keep pushing to make it a good game  given how rough it is right now
fun game but needs to fix the aim down sight shooting becuase it shoots as if i was moving and shooting moving and shooting is prob a better option than actually aiming down also hackers are making it  not fun and devs need to fix
TOO MANY CHINA HACKERS
A game that as far as im concerned will just keep getting better and better
too laggy server too many hackers ingame not optimized as well
Jump Get killed Retry
Nothing gets the blood pumping like being in the top 5 in this gameYou will shake for minutes after the closer games which is an experience that very few other games can offerThe only real negative is the amount of chinese that have truely taken over every server and the fact that you ll likely run into a hacker at least once every 5 or so games Fun game would scream at teammates again 910
While you can tell that it s still in early access it has the quality of a game that s fully released It s super fun to play both alone and with friends and I would 100  recommend it to anyone else Also you can say that you jumped on the PUBG bandwagon Only complaint is lack of optimization which will come in time but it still only runs at around 45 60 FPS on my computer which runs CS GO at around 300Overall great game would buy again
Better Than Expected
Havent played a game in a long time that showed so much promise The base concept the gunplay and the game feels so good when everything works and runs smoothly Unfortunately a the moment it is very much an Early Access title   the optimisation is awful the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the game is litered with bugs and you ll frequently find yourself dying or stuck due to random issues Yet the game is still an immensely rewarding and enjoyable game despite all this You hate it so much but you find it so damn good and there is no game in the genre thats close to the feeling it can provide I honestly hope Bluehole can pull this over with the 10 release I dont expect them to as I believe the engine foundations that the game is built on are too much of a mess but I really want to be proven wrong
Love This Game But Please Fix Some Bug Ingame Please Thanks
It has its ups and downs  laggy servers but the overall physics and teambased play  duos   squads is well done Recommend you give it a try if you haven t probably spend 200 hours easily
Most games you play to win You play to have fun Not this You don t play to win You play to survive The chicken dinner just like the cake is a lie You don t care about the chicken You only care that you have survived It s like living in a perpetual Belko experiment And just like the Belko experiement you finish this game not with a feeling of victory but a feeling of anger Why  Why would someone put you through this  Hundreds of people dying and for what a chicken dinner 
This game is riddled with hackersSnap to target head shots  shooting through walls  no weapon recoil Game has been ruined 
vault
best game    
interesting to play Looking forward to visit the dessert and the snowy weather
GGWP chicken dinner
Super fun game Makes your heart race in intense situations
good game but buggy as hell
Game is fun but is not for everyone because it never really goes on sale and still has way too many problems to be considered ready for release  Fix the bugs and this game would be worth the 30 but right now there are other battle royale games that are a lower price and are more established
China is raiding the game with toxic players   camping the whole game even outside the blue zone  you can hear a very weird sounds while you are in the plane  hackers  they never care about a friend life    this game is dying
Kill them and shout  Try harder  to trigger them
i love it so much as i hate it
This game deserves all the rewards because reasons and logic and we all die at school
Hackers and a gun game with guns spawning at rare chance
Pros   Had the potential to be a great game  Fun to play with friends  Plenty of money to be made from lootboxesConsWhere to I begin  Developers don t seem to listen to customers  Simple Collision systems and physics systems can send you soaring through the air to your death  Playing on minimar is pretty much a running simulator  Hackers in 50  of games  NO REGION LOCK Massive issue  Can be pretty repetitive  No map choice feels like they force feed you a map they know we all hate  3 hour downtime for updates every weeek  Always during primetime US  In my opinion its an unfinished game pushed into full production by greedy game developers who wanted profits from the console marketBut the thing that will tip most players over the edge is the latest updateNot listening to the consumer increasing the zone speed early game turns this game into a sprinting simulator now If you are unfortunate enough to not get a circle spawn you are more likely to be killed by the zone than other players This takes the entire competitve side away from players early game It could have been a great game but it has been wasted by very bad development choices
Love the game just wish they would fix it
nice optimization 10 outta 10 for optimization
Full of bugs but playable
SAAAAAAAAAAAALE
10 Update sucks I used to get 60 fps on med settings now i barley get 40 on low still a good game tho
Extremely Frustrating Insanely Fun Hilariously Broken Highly Addictive
Please release the final PC version as sson as possible
thats a great games
This game consumes my life
We are born into this world naked We spend our lives looting in search of a better life Our goal is to ultimately achieve a nice chicken dinner Then we die get reincarnated and do it all over again
They said it would come outIt hasn t Early Access for life title right here
Good game many bugs but they are clearly making progress and improving the game Keeping in mind that this is in early access the concept is really good and the many game elements make the game three dimensional
The game has alot of work left to make it good you have your good games  and really bad laggy or  stupid mech s that get you killed  i would say buy it if you have friends that are fine with restarting a few times
Scopes are life
HELLO I DISLIKE THIS LAST UPDATE ABOUT ZONE SPEED I PLAY MANY GAMES I DIE FROM ZONE 15 TIMES U WANT COUNT PLAYERS DEAD OUT SIDE ZONE PLZ PUT SOME MORECARS  AND HEALS AND LET PLAYERS KILLING THEM SELFS FROM WEAPONS NOT BLUE ZONE TY I KNOW U  HAVE GOOD BRAINS AND U WANT THIS GAME GO FORWARD sir i want know who gives u this idea about blue zone speed  i think this man or woman want crash this game  this idea very bad  plz the old game was better  and this devloper how take this step i thin he is ronge  i tell u way the game was good and we enjoy the game i think he should think about removing the cheaters very fast better than fast the blue zone and ty   steamsalty 
Its worth the money But they really need to adjust the unforgiving damage system when it comes to driving and entering vehicles The current system is downright LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and extremely buggy Random vehicles flips on 3 man bikes Irrational high damage on invisible obstacles The desert map is not only trhe ugliest and least exciting map its also littered with buggs Blueballs get your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  togheter dawg
this game has some issues but i still think it is incredibly fun to play  and i am awful at it
The game isn t doing anything innovative but it s addicting and fun to play with friends as long as you don t take it too seriously
Best game ever definitley a must buy game
Is a nice game let s get come chicken for dinner 
Make you wish you could smack your balls across the scope of that no life who just killed you with a Kar98
I don t want the chaniz to be the only nambawan
This game uses 100 out of 1 cruel rules to make the player immersed
New update looks very good
Love this game even though I ll never know where I got killed from when I was hiding atop the bridge
WP game
Its good so far
BAD PERFORMANCE  WHERE IS MY PATCH GG IZI
910 Needs more skins
i don t know why this game have a massive player peakday up to 25 million wat de hek but i know this game very addictive ez to play ez to understand but hard to win it    however this game is best game at 2017 i think must buy it 
I rate this game 510 Wind physics obviously included yet a car on a magnet is not swaying with the wind  honestly defeats the gameplay however everything else is fine as long as you learn chinese and obviously the cluster that is school
310 will play Escape From Tarkov again
goud
bugThis game is a good game no matter how LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the bug the optimization or the anti cheat system is i can still wait After all this game is growing But bulehole chose to cooperate with a company which i dislike so i chose to write my first negative comment
Super good
WHY IS TENCENT     
The best Battle Royale game out there And it s still in early access A new map is coming and updates are frequent
The gameplay is fun and it doesn t feel like a chore to play These bugs are a chaotic mess though Consider yourself warned bugs will mess with your experience greatly
Decent really fun with a group of friends 810 with friends 510 solo
Even with bugs this game is better than twighlight  D
Just love it
meme
I love this game worth the 30 I can t wait till the for the updaits comming soon Thx Bluehole for making such a great game  
Is what DayZ should have been really Oustanding
Lags bugs and crashes
Fun way to get TILTED
Buggy as all hellyet I keep coming back  The game is plagues with bugs You get stuck in doorshallwayscarsbushesyour parachute gets caught on stuff when trying to land You still cannot vault over walls as of today I keep coming back for that INTENSE feeling you get when its you and 3 other people left I dont play alone that much since I have friends i play squad of duos with That being saidthe game is currently suffering from cheaters I can be going like 80mph on a bike and  headshot  i can be hidden and be fine and all of a sudden someone sees me Google PUBG hacks youll see they do exist wallhacks etcit gets really fun when you are driving and you jump up a hill and your car does like 10 flips and u land it I would place this in the middle between like SQUADARMA and like a a tom clancy third person
The Game has its flaws but keeps you coming back for more You will rage You will Laugh You will call BS You will have the    scared out of you and you will go back for more
This Game Is Soooo Addicting Making Me Wanna Play Non Stop
Great conceptBut please upgrade it better
Choosing Tencent as the agent Bluehole just destroyed the PUBG
Really fun game but also really laggy
Great survival shooter for the non reflex spamming gamer Patience and good decision making will see you through the fight Recent influx of hackers and lag after the last patch unfortunately but its no different then when the original Counterstrike came out Hit up the PUBG discords and get a regular group to match playstyles
It s a game
Very interesting game You must have steel nerves Go and play  But steel need some optimization Waiting for PC 10
1010 got hit by a car in last 10 alive  D
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS GAME
Great game This game is really fun to play Can t wait for 10
At the time of this review January 1 2018 I cannot recommend this game Since the 10 launch PUBG has been dealing with an influx of hackers and Chinese server hopping to the US 99  of the hackers you see will have Chinese names Those from China that aren t hacking are desynced so badly that they begin teleporting around not taking damage or landing shots on you from behind cover This can especially be seen from 2am est to 7am est The new death Cam and replay features are great in the fact that you can see who is willing using no recoil etc  My team just played 4 games where we were completely decimated by hackers who weren t running armor or helmets with only 30 or so people left The replays show the shots not having any effect on the guys while they twitch to each of our heads I refuse to play this game until R E G I O N   L O C K is a thing It will help mitigate US players from having to deal with desync and will lower the amount of hacking US players will have to deal with
Loads o  problems
Jump land loot shoot miss get shot hide reload heal shoot die 1010
Constantly keeps you on your toes
My friend runs better than this game and he has no legs
FIX ALL THE BUGS AND SERVER STOP DOING LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING NONSENSE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LIKE FLARE GUNSKINSCUSTOM MATCH MEANWHILE U LAG LIKE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
It s Cool Just play it  
PlayerUnknown s BattleGrounds is an alright game But not perfect since the banning system is flawed and is not as affective due to people being banned for just playing the game and ending up killing a streamer and gets wrongly accused of cheating And for people that are cheating will not have much of an impact because they could just buy another copy on another account and thus the cycle continuesThe game has a lot of bugs and has some optimization problems but the main thing that is good Is that they are constantly changing the game and trying to improve it By adding more content and adding more things to make the game better and more appealing to new players This game was made for people who want to have fun with or without their friends But also is made for people that take the game competivelyI am not praising this game as a masterpiece but also not as a bad game Im saying that this game has a long time to reach the curtain part that will have everyone being happy with the game and agree with the games futureSo what I have to give this game right now as we speak will be a710
Got killed and yelled at in Some asian language that then proceeded to be killed as well by other asian speaking people 1010
This is just one of those games that make you want to slam your desk most of the time but sometimes you get into a very good match And those  good  match are the reason I continue to play this game It is definitely the best Battle Royale game out there and very easily worth 30
much better dinners  3
Fk chinese cheating fresh off the boat 2 cent an hour looking azz mfs
Salty deaths 1010 A very Good Graphic 2017  JK unstable server killed by sniper from a far without knowing anything 1010 very stealthy game U can died from FaLLiNg when in the ground some cases do not need a key to open but still lot of crap better sell the cases than opening it full payment unstable early access game

The best game of combat survival multiplayer and battle royale on 2017
Very skilled based game
Hello my name is Jeremy I like to play Battlegrounds and camp in the blue circle for 12 hours straight and inhale painkillers and medkits I was adopted at birth I was beat by my father every day I was bullied in school For all this time I wanted revenge on humanityNow 34 years later I have found PUBG I can now get my revenge on the demons inside me Every day I get 43000 kills in Battlegrounds and nobody can ever see me If they were good they would just get good and not die and be able to spot me 400 miles away But they suck because they are just kids and need to get mutedEvery day my mom feeds me doritos I have not been outside for the past 20 years The last time I went outside I got sunburn and almost died I had to go to the hospital because I had third degree burns I have not left my chair in six years One time my mother got a dog and when it entered my room it died from the smell I just want to be accepted I just want to be loved When my mom comes into my room she has to wear a gas mask I am Jeremy and this is my story
The game runs smooth on my end
910 people who downvoted this game are just bad and can t get good
This is the worst game I ve ever played but I just don t know why I m still playing it and even for 150 hours
Gave me testicular cancer 1010
It s enjoyable
With the recent changes of fixing tickrate to 60hz and overall massive performance increases since the beggining I can finally recommend picking this game up Exceptional gameplay and intense fights All they need now is a reworked ranked system and I would be on this all the time Highly recommend
Can t even connect to the server
ehhhhhhhh pretty good game
1110 Game  y
I don t know why I enjoy this game some much even more than H1Z1 and other battle royale game s But I do it is extremely intence and challenging it is even more fun to play with friends those there are some bugs and issues such as hackers and the game isn t amazing optimised the game is constantly being updated and new features being added
KEEP RANDOMLY CRASHING DONT BUY THIS GAME
What other game let s you detonate a grenade in the backseat of a Humvee turning your entire team into a high speed inferno barreling towards the enemy at 100mph while you blast Salil Al Swareem through the global voice chat1010 would detonate myself againChina number 1
pubg is great lol

We all know this game isnt great Hence the whole early access sticker But we still love it all the same Its always improving and its a game thats hard to put down
Great fun for an early access game Has some issues but the devs are constanly working on improving them Looking forward to the 10 release coming soon
Great game 1110 would drop from a plane again

What you got from 8 months in early access Addition of lootcratesStill not optimised
Don t land in the school
nice game guys
Good game idea and nicely done but optimisation is terrible Do not buy unless you accept to play on very low with unstable fps
Although the game has a LOT of problems it is still fun to play
Lags bugs cheaters low fps and freezez on any setting   WELCOME TO THE PUBG
This game is an absolute monster A monster sized creme brulee filled with cow dungIEdit  Honestly hope that PlayerUnkown gets an unhealable anal fissure that keeps him from sleeping at night
if you like slideshows this game is for you
Best Game Ever
PUBG   Clash of the Titans
Pan Game   D
Aleways playing if i have some spare time Cannot wait for the updateAlmost being addicted lol
Got a couple hundred hours in it despite the bugs glitches and hackers With a few friends this game is a great laugh and given thats its still in early access these things can be forgiven
This game willThis game will LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you off and after that you make you want kill everybody in the server So if youre the kinda a guy thats like to play with yours friends you will enjoy this game
Lavvvv it
Simple game but addictive either in solo or teamLiterally just press Play and surviveOnly problem right now is cheaters something you will always have to deal with in the PC platform
I do not fully understand why but this is one of the greatest games I have ever played
Crash every 10 minutes so sad
This game has so much potential but has some bugs still and poor game features however still a great game
Really fun game Highly recommend
a very unique idea truly one of a kind
Even vegetarians will be craving chicken after playing this
man what to say that has not been saidTaking the battle royale formula and making it as fun and as stressful as possible kuddos
I mean I like it
is this normal playing with china in every server 
those chinese rats                                    
To good to be rated
1010 would china numba one again
Highly addicted
Game is fun with friends but the occasional chinese hacker who will 3 tap ur head when wearing a lvl 3 helmet from 500 metres away with an S12k shotgun will ruin some of the fun you will have with the game I ll recommend it IF you have friends to play with regularly but dont get the game at its current state if you are buying it for the solo experienceAlso the game is terribly optimised so if you have a weak gpu like my pc you re gonna get around 35 40 fps at the lowest resolution and settings PC specs Nvidia Gtx 745i7 4790 processor8gb ram
fhdesbrdasdasdasdadasdasdasdasdasdasdas
Very Fun Game
i leike h1z1 lel
Amazon game
Has some problems but worth the 30
Really good game Must play But lots of hackers in this game and the anti cheat system is not that goodhopefully itll get fixed
Just for the task to be completed
I love playing broken games It is so fun to discover new bugs every day and I hope the developers continue braking the game from update to update That s what keeps me from ending it all Gotta luuuuv PUBG and the dedication behind it  3
fix server lags and cheaters thats all
I love to play this game with squads So many things you can do to fail horribly Laughing your LOVE LOVE LOVE  off while driving and messing up driving over your pal   Thinking you shooting enemies while you actually shooting teammates Seeing a downed friend run there and res himher just to shoot him down again   Laughing Even more making an LOVE LOVE LOVE  of your self at stream
Got killed by a ghillied guy in the bush1110 would play again to find that guy again
New game that started a new era for games
It was the hype that got me into the game at first i was skeptical but well i was wrong the game is so amazing you can have fun or you can go full commando mode  Solo play or Squad up to enjoy the game at its fullest with friends  This is totally worth game on hype train Love it 
Really unstable laggy and overall clunky game Only enjoyable because the rush of winning and killing is very good
Great game to play with friends
Fun game to play Espcecially with a couple friends The weapon spawns are random and you can t be sure where to look first This makes the game harder but really interesting  You will be feeling nervous all the time playing This game is a total thriller I recommend this game so far
Sup
Well yeah I preorderd it and sold the skins for 5 bucks now I am hear crying
this game still sucks
Its all up to the RNG gods to decide if you get a pistol a crowbar or an ak when playing this game
If I give this game a thumbs up will I finally get an AWM 
  
This game used to be good but then the conversations went like this 1   Hey let s ruin our game by adding new bad stuff 2   Okay Uhh i know lets add a map that litteraly looks like diarrhea and maybe nerf some guns to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  some people off 1   Great idea Now let s make the diarrhea map Hmm i m thinking like let s not put anything in the center of the map cuz people clearly don t like to drop school on the current map 2   Nice good thinking Oh and also no really nice places to loot Just random little dumps where you can get lucky 1   Maybe place the only good loot place down in the bottom left corner where the circle and plane never will be good for 2   Ok this is pretty good Also let s add 2 pistol slot guns 1 revolver which will be decent BUT we also add a double barrel shotgun that everyone will use instead of the revolver oh also the revolver should not be able to have a suppresor cuz we just don t want it to have that1  Okay so now that everybody is playing fortnite let s bring them back by adding an event mode just like in fortnite where we will have 8 man squads of mostly random people that can t communicate because of their different languages and most of them will be small kids Oh yeah 2x AR mode Very creative i bet they ll be rushing back from fornite to good old  sorry new LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pubg
git gut
Love the sounds love the gameplay love every thing about exept the fog weather
It is the best battle royal game
Best Game Ever  accept for the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing china number 1 cheaters

Before this game had it s recent updates it was fun You could have a laugh and mess around with friends running for your life  from somone charging at you with a frying pan
You should download more RAM
Best Game to this year
Start and die Start again until u got your first chicken dinner

30 Bucks for a poorly coded game where you have to put graphisms to minimum to spot people easier where the gameplay for the parachute is crap where vehicules can be your worst ennemi etc etc 
Just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
I wrote this review for a badge
Fun game buggy
game is k
Although the game has many flaws the developers are working constantly to fix them The upcoming patches are fixing so many issues My favorite new game of 2017
I nominated this game for The Garbage Optimization award
Games fun but has a lot of hackers in every top 10 game
good game with friends  
i think that the 81 hours i have on this game is the best time i have had with a game in a while So i really recommend this game
The game is worth the moneyAlso it can be recoup Also coming release Suggest this game
Is a good game to hang on with friends Has e good graphics and very challenging I recommend to buy if you like last standing games
I do indeed like this game haha yes
Epic
The connection interrupted symbol lost me three games where i was in second place
 Join a game Be killed by a chinese hacker with aim and speed repeatThis game is highly recommended for those who like consistancy in games
Well it is a definitely nice game but what s the point of playing if it keeps clashing A LOT lately 
My experience so far with this game  Ballistic makes no sense lag and stuttering you can easily put like five bullets in someone from close distance he s left with basically no health and kills you with two shots no recoil no suppresion nothing same gun or same class gunMovement  as unrealistic as it gets no to mention the jumping animation and the constant glitching and the paradise created for hackers But then again the ballistic and perhaps whatever they call hit reg is the biggest reason I will say a big f       NO to this well I would rather call it mistake than a game
Game 1010 the best in its genre The game needs updates in the form of optimization more servers fixing bugs adding new maps things and weapons and the game will gain even more popularity xD
Awaiting for Patch v1  Please Hustle Guys  D
this game really sucks i get killed 90  of the circle because of damage
easy chicken dinner
Best game ever  no
Mom s Spaghetti
Headshot simulator yayayayaya boiiiiiii if he dies he dies

Its really hard to get along with this game but if u dou cant get enough of it
GOod game
The game is awful
Awesome game Really fun to play solo and with a teamGreat graphics and mechanicI really loved H1Z1 and left it in favour of PUBG It was like the same Battle Royale style but better
Awesome and fun game to play  
This game demands lots of potatoes to run
Eh the redzone never hits anybody anyways  get hit by redzone bomb  anyone up for another game 
I love the game very much even thow I have not play a lot only about 94 hours I would rcommend it to other prople that like gun games it has many ways of playing the game like custom matches and fpp I like how you can play in duos and squads and solo to The game has very good graphics and it looks and feels very real Hope you have the game and like or get it
Fire in the blue hole tencent asshome
lets say it like that this game is good but have a lot of probloms 710 until a fix
Great They fixed a lot of issues It good for now
Chicken dinner  
good game but they should f cking fix nades If you get flashed you are just lagging instead of flashed and the chance of crashes is so much higher when people are throwing nades Pls fix
Best Game Ever probably its gonna win the THE STEAM AWARDS
Nice game funny and easy to control
This game is just a gong show Love it AND Hate it
one of the best games i have played  first time playing when it came outits meh  after 245hrsfix the cheaters and it would be fun and lock the server locations
This game is still being developed but as of right now it boasts a highly replayable game mechanic and is extremely popular in the communityGraphics  810 Could be better could be worse I think we will see a lot more in the future and this excites me The graphics are already great and camouflaging yourself is a great tactic with the current graphicsAudio  710 Not a bad musical score for the menu but in a game like this music is NOT needed You would be better off listening for footstepsControls  910 Extremely easy to learn and almost perfect for the game mechanics The control scheme is very familiar and will make you feel right at home if you ever play FPSTPSMultiplayer  1010 Off the chart Great interactivity between players and lots of little helpers along the way Most of the people you meet are jerks but it just adds to the feel of the game It s like Rust meets Battlefield without the ability to build anythingOverall  8510This game is still in it s early stages and there will be many new updates I hope you are along for the ride with me Because I would definitely recommend this game to anyone
The Game has its bugs and thats normal for a pre realease game They are still working on it and i get weekly updates
IF YOU WANT CANCER IN YOUR LIVER YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE  DO YOU LIKE LAG  DO YOU LIKE LOW FPS EVEN ON A ULTRA PC   GG PLAY THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  AND EVEN PAY 4 IT
Game in the current state is not enjoyable Servers are laggy af and loot doesn t spwan right away First 10 minutes are a slideshowI would recomend playing Fortnite but there aiming is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I really want to like this game but there are so many issuesSome patches later still feels like an alpha But we have more crates
Imagine an FPS gameokay now this isn t one In soon time I expect this game to add your player to be able to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  eventually skins for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  will be added and if you ever run with bike over that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you will break the game
This is a good fun game would like to see  many more maps just to change up things so you don t get bored on the same 2 maps fix sound issue that occur once in while after maintanence I am really liking the event modes that have been coming around it makes for a nice change
baaaaaaaaaaaaaad gaaaaaaaaaaaaame
Fun  3
based too much on luck weapon spawns are random and map is too big net code sucks
Game with a lot of potential but poorly optimised and can be very frustrating when you die Don t buy this is you re looking for a casual game You ll have to invest a lot of hours before you re any good
This game hurt my feelings
Awful never experienced network lag with a game more than this Every other game I own runs fine
While I do get the arguments in all the negative reviews   this game is incredibly fun And incredibly addicting More than any other I can think of that came out in the last decade or so I had a blast when I was playing it on a laptop with 20 FPS and I m having a blast now after I ve upgraded to a 8700k and a 1080Ti which CAN run it at 200 FPS if you re using 1080p res The  eSports ready  meme exists for a reason and I honestly don t see Bluehole ever fixing it to the point where it will become competitively viable But as a casual game  Something to play with friends and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  around  Something to play after a long day  It just may be perfect even with all its issuesIf you re all about winning and improving and such well CS GO and Quake Champions will cater to your needs If not give PUBG a try it absolutely is worth itThe ingame crates paid for the game in like a month and in  150 hours I even made a handy little profit from it Pretty satisfied with my purchase overall
Very bad game for twitch money farming and selling boxes with skins to Chinese kids
I can t get loot off my mind Whether I m at work or eating or having sexI just can t stop thinking about the looter life I change songs like Spice Girls  If you want to be my lover  to  If you want to be my looter  and Tech N9nes  I m a playa  to  I m a looter  Sometimes my friends and I will bring it back to the basics and sing LA LA LA LA LA LOOTEREvery time I parachute down from the plane I say  Looter out  Whenever we see level 3 gear or a silencer in the highest tone capable by man we let out an ooooooOOOOOOOOoooo When we hear the oooOOOOOoo we know one of us got some good loots I look at my texts and it ll be my friend  ay_stave  saying one word  Looter   I respond  Looter  We joke about getting looter tattoos but I m starting to think it s actually going to happen We love to parachute down to shelter or as we like to call it bunky looter We don t just say bunky though we POP the BUH sound in BUNK and screech the EEEE at the end like a dying mouse BUH UNN KEEEEEE Stave says  wanna get funky   and I immediately know where we re goingbut when the bunky is bunk its extra bunky Whenever we spawn into a fog game we go FOGGGEEEEEEE just like bunky You really gotta go high pitch on the eeeee let your inner 12 yr old take over I d like to say I m actually 26 and I might be full on mentally ill at this point but it s LOOTER I say looter randomlywe ll just be running through the hay or driving around and I occasionally just say looter I think I m developing a mild form of tourettes Stave and I merk kids and take them to the village What village you ask  Merkantile village We re always showing people the village If you want a game that s going to completey change how you talk to your friendsand make you slightly psychoticthis is the game Lastly I send you off with the actual lyrics to  If you wanna be my looter If you wanna be my lootergotta get with my teammake loot last foreverthats the pubg dreamLooter out
This game is good at this moment and I expect more improvements is very enjoyable playing with friends I truly recommend
literally unplayable if the devs want to add skins to get even more money out of this game they should at least try to fix it first
Bad game
game cheat ceiling the company earned money but the new winning games this company still does not optimize the guy what the server or server has fixed
This is the first game I ve ever asked for a refund on I have never enjoyed a walking simulator less than this
Now battleeye released full version AwesomePROSOptimizations are greatTwo Map and Different StrategiesMany players play this gameConsTo much lag In the beginningLobby page reloads too late     Early Access GameIt s a great game Map guns strategies care packages etc are really good Optimizations are going betterConsNeed optimization
such a fun game
It has its bugs and quirks but it s early access Still a great game I play the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  out of it
Its fun to play Forget the reviews see for yourself Hf
It s exciting
 THIS is going to get GOTY
Ez Gameplay all player can play it
This game is cancer full of tryhard bug abusing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s and cheaters run by a team of greedy devs who only care about money The net code is worse that Battlefield 4 was at launch and hit detection for people unfortunate enough not to live inside the server is nonexistent The RNG element is massive and often determines whether you win or loseWhy bother fixing the game when you can add loot crates  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
Just got the game and already love it This is definitly the best Battle royal game on the market This game is intense and brutal but thats what makes it so fun I started my first game and died and then i jump back into my game immeditly with almost no wait time I havent experienced any hackers like so many people are saying are in  every game  Thats just not true When i die i acutally feel like i was out skilled rather than out lucked Fortnite for example 90  of the kills  mine included are pure luck This game acutally takes skill and knowing what kind of guns you have and what scopes go good with them Great game and I am so glad that they are adressing all the  hackers in every game  so fast
HFGHFGXHFGX
super unoptimized dont buy
Good Game challenging and has a learning curve but its really fun with a buddy get tactical and dont have to build LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
     
 buys game plays for 10 minutes  19fps refund 1010 not buying again
i never really enjoyd the game and i would like to get a refund but because i have played it in 6 hours and had it a long time i can t
why the FxxK the FPS dropped after update    My FPS keeps dropping after updates should it be rising though  What is the logic behind it                              
MY NAME NEO04POO
This is incredible piece of s  t
gameplay  super fun The thing is only texture loading bug and some other plenty bugs The reason i dont recommend this game is because the connection issues Network lag detected for example If you face this you ll have to exit to the lobby and reconnect it again which is very annoying And secondly the servers are always busy You will get servers being busy I HATE THIS
Very good and interesting gameplay but nineth chapter is pretty hard
Its good poorly optimized tho prob got 20 back cuz i sold a bunch of loot crates
I ve never encounter any hackers YET but hopefully they will fix the hacking issue in this game
a mess but a good one
Game wouldn t launch
Slow H1Z1 meh
The game is fun and really entertaining but it also comes with a few cons I dont want to go in full detail but the game still has some huge issues with launching the gamepros    The game is as I said fun and entertaining and it feels really good getting that chicken dinner The game does not require much skill and it is easy to understand and play Soon they will add a new map  which i cant play because the game is acting strange and they will also add vaulting Currently you have to crouch jump and that isnt really consisten when jumping walls and through windows  it might lose you the game cons   The game requires a decent pc Before i played on my old laptop and the game was laggy I played with bad quality and the buldings used to load for a really long time So before you pay for the game check your specs  I have played 200 hours and i didnt have any problems with the game and i enjoyed it alot but now the game is having huge troubles with launching Last week i loged into pubg to play but in the top left corner it said loading so i let the game load for a few hours and nothing happens I contact pubg support and get help and the fix worked for a few days untill I got the same problem but this time the old fixes didnt help I contact the support yet again and im still waiting for an answer If you buy this game be aware that there might be a small chance for your game to get f   ed There are many people that have been affected by this and if bluehole dont fix these types of problems then there will be more unsatisfied gamers that cant play pubg To conclude my long review it is that bluehole  creators of PUBG has a long way to go they need to fix bugs and crashes and improve their game before adding new maps or else many people are left behind because something is wrong when they try to load the game Dont buy the game it is not worth it it is only fun the first 100 hours and then it is downhillIf you wonder what types of specs I have Nvidia 1070intelcore 7600k 16GB ramSSD
need more update
The game was bornflourished and now its dieingServer lag  Desync  Hackers You name it Edit 1   Are you trying to make this game better or worse  As of 24112017 game is tottaly unplayableDesynced most of the times  early stage of game Dont even let me start on that If you cant handle it sell the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  projectEdit 2   E sports ready  TrollFace worst spend money ever next time i ll just burn the bills so i can get some heat out of themEdit 3  PC Version 10 BEST EU esports ready NOT
The game is pretty good with all my considerationthey keep optimizing alsothey new contents are litthe cheaters is just on the way
The  Mom s Spaghetti  Award  
There have been a lot of negative reviews in the past month or so And i feel like the game kinda deserves that but it also doesntA lot of people are complaining about cheaters but i ve only come across 1 cheater It LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  me off but the game definitly isnt unplayable like many people are saying The game is still very fun and the gameplay is very goodBluehole has been working hard to fix the cheating problem and they are bringing out a lot of updates The amount of updates isnt as high as it used to be but atleast they are still pushing out some updates once in a while The devs promised alot for this game and they didnt do all the things that they promised but the devs didnt let me down imo Now some people may have problems with framerates but its simple the game has been optimized in the past updates but if you cant run it you cant run it Just refund the game or upgrade your rigDespite all the hate i d still recommend this game because its just very fun to play Especially if you get better at the game and play with friends
Its okay I guess
it is impossible to play too many cheaters
Probably the worst game in my library
Recent favourite game for sure
CHINA NUMBER ONE  GO SCHOOOLLLL 
Run until you get shot in the head by a dude with a kar98 simulator57
After spending almost 650 hours on this game I thought I should write a review about this one Let s start I did have alot of fun inn this game  and It still a fun game to play but atm This game is a joke full release game  there s tons of bugs servers issueservers busy desync cheaters and needs toon of  optimizationfix and even more then they removed the weather like Rain Fog Mist  3 did even make fore fun to play it  but anyway if you like to loose alot to hordes of chinese HACKERS   then this game is something for u  Hackers hackers everywhere                                     
Alright boys Let me just sum this up for ya You land at School You shoot up everybody there Then get a vehicle and drive to the circle Just to die to some random chinese hacker that just yells NI HAO NI HAOThen go into another game and try it again But this time stay away from school But little do you know Chinese hackers are everywhere Then you die All i can say is try your best and heres a little tip from a pro Always land at Hacienda Del Patron  Also it is illegal to shoot up schools So refrain from landing at school please Ty Have a nice dayLoveCpt Chung Li Wun
OLD review was positive This game went from being good to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE why the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  wouldn t you just region lock China and Russia Because of your stupid LOVE LOVE LOVE  anti cheat engine the game is complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  It franquently crashes and loading time takes for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing ever This game used to be good during Beta now it s complete LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  NICE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IGN JOB LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  HEADS
GG VALVE
Fun gameplay frustrating performance
M
I think this is one of the best Battle royale games
I really enjoy this game its great fun to play with friends I would like a bot mode added to make practising easier
At its present state game isn t playableIt is plauged with bugs performance issues  look up forums all kinds of performance issues even on the highest of gear server side issues etcWhat makes matters worse nobody seems to care  It really feels like devs are all in on XB version at the momen as a potential source of revenue and nobody seems to care about ongoing issues and existing gamers baseI would be honestly suprsied if this ever leaves beta
You don t own the battle royal ganre
They release 26mb update twice a day and game still keeps crashing I pressed START and game crashed it s a joke netcode is a joke optimalization is a joke And 10gb update that added new skins is also a joke Don t buy it This game is a NO NO
very good game ive had tones of fun on it would recomend
gr8 r8 88 appreci8 the h8 m8 gr8 b8 btw  
I played until october then NETWORK LAG DETECTED message always kick me out of the game at the start Unplayable for me I tried everything I waited patches nothing works If a game starts it always stop with that damn message in the first few minutes
Great game It is on it s way to become a next great game However it is not perfect but is still good hopefully the bugs will be fixed by the time the full game releases
don t by this piece of  it s under devolped and the player base is full of try hard scum bags that just like to yell at each other just like in csgo it s called early access for a reason it means it s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  until it gets updates all this hype for this crappy game that a person with an average internet connection and a decent pc can t even run 
I came into this game expecting very little of it but i  have to say this game is an absolute blast to play minus its problems as an early access game it runs well and feels amazing to play especially if you like battle royale gamesAnd one thing i absolutely love about this is that it s very noob friendly it s easy to get into you don t have to really learn the recoil patterns like in a game like h1z1 which is the absolute opposite of noob friendlyPro s Fun Easy to get into noob friendly looks and runs wellConsIn all honesty i can t really think of any real cons sure it has problems like it could have better optimization but overall most of the problems are because the game is still in a early access beta stage
Great game very fun and immersive My and my friends have lan parties and we play this all day and night and wer e having a blast
Awesome addictive game  Just wish they will give us SA servers
FULL OF CHINESE HACKERS
In China I can t update the game in time click the start button to connect failure
Edit  Old Early access review at the bottomChanged my rating to recommened It s a lot of fun though after your first fifty to a hundred hours or so you re going to be very aware of the myriad of bugs and issues in the gameYou will have to get used to them as BlueholdPubg Corp is very very slow in fixing most things and is very bad at communication It s still very much worth the  for the amount of fun you can get out of it The hacker issue is a lot better than it was at least in First Person Just play first person anywayTried fortnite this is better imo Fortnite is just more polished with less issues but if you are a fan of shooers then this is far more fun If a new game similar to this comes out without the bugs most players will jump ship If you do buy the game sell your crates you will have earned back 30 in no time and will be able to buy whatever ingame clothing you want with the proceeds too                                  OLD Review                    Really do love the game but the hacking is out of control on the Oceania servers It should be priority 1 Second  they still have don t have First Person Servers for OC there are more than enough players for itIf you have a crew to play with the games worth it Otherwise just wait and play something else Go buy Insurgency or something for a few bucksI ll adjust my review down the line when  hopefully these things are sorted out Maybe after the official launch  Lets hope
Ive Played 150 hours of this game and while going through the other reviews i saw a constant theme of people claiming to be in games with hackers or people being kicked for killing streamers Now throughtout my playing time i have never been in a game with a hacker  that im aware of and i have never been personally kicked I do play on the oceania servers and have always had a good playing experience either in solo duo or squad play and i would personally recommened this game to anyone910  just a few things that do need to be fixed but should be fixed in the future
first person mode makes me puke
410 at best
why banned me i am a good player
Rampant obvious cheaters will for ever ruin this game combined with bad net code you can t help feel suspicious of every questionable death When what happens on your screen isn t the same as the other players in the squad this game will leave you frustrated  Esports ready  NO more like cash in as much as we can on this broken game that even if we fixed it the player trust is broken
Its really fun
BEST GAME  But need the completed game asap
Pick a spot on a map Jump from a plane Loot as much as you can Run away or run to the marker Kill or be killed Winner winner chicken Diner or Death Repeat
It s very very interesting
Optimize the game you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
What makes me dislike this game is that it is really unoptimized Even with a beast PC you would only get like 20 fps which means it has to be played with Low settings And on Ultra low i got 2 fps Even Crysis could run better with High graphics
This is a great gameIt has great graphics and great gameplay it just need SA Servers please
  100    3              
The best game I ever played Im so addicted to it
It s a good game you loot for approx 20 mins and you die to a camper 1110
Not too bad
Super entretaining
30 for a bullet proof panpretty worth it if you ask me
In current state PUBG is very bad optimized laggy glitched game but in other hand it has very exciting multiplayer gameplay If you can live with all these cons the game is for you For most people I recommend to wait until they will fix the game for some point where the gameplay will be smooth and without so many bugs I m will play for time to time to see what was changed and I will edit my review in the future For now I can t recommend this game
This game as it is utterly PLAGUED with hackers Also                                    and block high ping playersScores of this game is gown down faster than a frozen turkey off a plane
Love the game  I ve been a COD and BF fan boy for many a year now but pretty much stopped playing them altogether now to play this
This game is just amazing except there are too many non english speakers which ruins when you play squad or duo so better find your teammates first
don t buy this game until they fix everything with it  frames are bad servers are bad hackers everywhere glitchs crashes everything bad you can think of is in this game
Game is challenging and a lot of fun Lots of bugs and lag but thats early access for you  Game is steadily getting better
when u get shot by a skilled player HACKER when u r finding a final guy gets shot by him and he said CHINA NUMBER 1  CHINESE HACKER when u literally died by getting out of the car driving 70 kilometres per hr BUGS  Despite the negative effects i encountered in this game i enjoyed it and PUBG Corp WAKE UR B TCH A S UP AND START WORKING ON THE BUGS AND HACKERS PLS FORTNITE IS WINNING FOR MONTHS AND U WONT EVEN FIX UR OWN GODDAMN GAME ALL U GUYS DID WAS GIVING NEW STUFF TO PLAYERS WHILE FORTNITE IS CONSUMING MORE PLAYERS PLUS FIXING THEIR OWN GAME and i gotta ask u guys one question DO U EVEN CARE ABOUT UR COMPANY AND YOUR GAME HUN   IF U DO PLS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  FIX UR GAME INSTEAD OF SITTING UR B TCH A S WATCHING UR GAME SLOWLY DYING
good game although still a lot to work on It s just in early access but it has a lot of potential and many people have called it game of the year  although somehow it hasn t won that title yet In my opinion again good game but it s being blown way out of proportion There are still a lot of flaws and it hasn t even been released as a full game yet Edit  If this game makes the 22 million people who bought early access for 30 pay for the actual game well
If you want to have fun in this game then try things like this   https youtube0nhBlNtUn7A  The game can get boring but its up to you to keep it fun
region lock china LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i keep getting killed by hackers and no one is going to be playing your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game in a year bet
Ready to spend thirty dollars on an insanely fun battle royale game that will crash and bug and refuse to render on any PC that isn t a high tier godly build  I sure was
The game is quite fun but not stable Need to improve a lil bit more
Loved this game at first but it s no longer worth playing It s bad enough that they won t region lock the servers but now it s gotten to the point where every game is auto aim hackers who can instant kill me It s so funny that BlueHole won t do anything just because they like saying they have 3 million players on all the time more then they like making their game good Glad to see dollar signs win going to be just as bad as EA
love It
Nice Graphic Pls Downspec for me        
Hackers low frame rate stuttering lag The technical team at Bluehole keeps demonstrating that they don t have the technical ability to execute a simple concept at this large scaleI can only hope that a competent developer sees the demand for this game type and implements it better
Disabling trade instead of fixing the game
best open world game out there
My friends and I like to get together and play on Saturdays as a squad  For months we would consistently rank in the top 5 of teams each game usually getting 1 2 chicken dinners a nightThe last month we re consistently murdered by teams from China where every user has names like  ajjajjajjajj  or  5435345345  who seem to be able to headshot us through walls before we even see they re there  It s beyond frustratingThe game was great before   super fun super promising  But the number of hackers and desynched players make this a nightmare at the moment  there is no region or ping lock  DO NOT recommend until this rectifiedEDITQuitting the game  Nothing but hackers  Enter a lobby hear 20 Chinese dudes shouting over each other get killed suspiciously check kill cam total LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tTonight my friend was killed when me was BEHIND a guy  Done with this buggy POS  I really hope one of its clones takes off
Poorly optimised game Beefy computer at low settings freezes when getting into a gun fight Fun but fix it
help plsss my game wont start
I have a problem i have an acer laptop with i7 7500U 8 gb ram and gtx 950mx 4 gb Is normal to play this game at 10 fps on this comfiguration 
This game is going the way of H1Z1 FPS is falling bugs aren t being addressed because they re too busy focusing on bringing out more stuff that also is going to come with its own list of problems 2017 and developers are still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing their games to this proportion Wait for actual release and see what people are saying then A 60 fps variance is unacceptable
Fix the damn servers on pc before releasing this incomplete game on Xbox
It is so painful to watch this beautiful game fade into idiotic Hackers  hands And unfortunately Bluehole does not seem to make an effort about it
The worst BR in the world H1Z1 is better than this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Love it And I will keep loving it so long as the cheater count keeps going down
GIOCO POPOPOPO DEMMERDA
This Game is the one and only in my library which i never get bored of and the graphics this game gives is so much awesome Love bluehole for providing such a game
Would definately recommend if your looking for a good version of the battle royal system that h1z1 is so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at
Hackers must be punishedWork hard PUBG Corporation
qsd
would be nice if the game would LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing run but the battleye for this game is broken fix your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Great game except every f cking Windows 10 update breaks it one way or another  pray4erangel
OMGG THIS GAME IS FULL WITH GLITHES ONLY GLITHES OMGGGG
Truly one of the best games I ve ever played  3
this game was intense kinda of in a movie because its sor realistic and scary at the moment but when you kill kinda of liking game because i like gun games
So many hackers in this game  Until fixed negative review
if you like missing every shotloved to get killed in the dumbest waythis is your bad game
123i7107041Too much hacker2Bluehole earned money from this game but the content of the game never renew3I can not play smoothly even with GTX1070i7 the fps of the game remains lower than 504The official has never considered players  feeling Bluehole takes the money then makes their new mmorpg but their original game PUBG is still like a piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I hope thta someday PUBG can be taken place by similar but higher quality games
its fun but whoever decided to make 50  of the item crate cost 150 to open needs to be shot Like i paid 40 for a glitchy early access game and slogged through it and what do they do but ask for more money for appearance only items I would say dont start playing because youll get addicted and angry
Pans deflect bullets 1010
Awful game Bad game No buy
Bad Optimized
Hey so i play this game now for a couple of months Yes it thrills and you freak out when you are alone or with friends amongst the last 10 ppl on the map This game gives you the thrills i didnt felt for along time But yes this game still feels  early access  the FPS drops sometimes are crazy The cheaters are seem to be banned like Blue Hole said 5 days ago Hope they don t come again Finish the game
Great Game For Multiplayer With Friend
Needs region lock really badly Nothing but chinese on NA servers Hackers run rampant Overall a fun game though if you can overlook the occasional hackers I do hope that report button leads to some better experiences for everyone
Imagine a really nice game with e sports while being open world and using awesome guns Now take away the optimization the stability add some bugs and make the devs ban people because of glitches in game There you go A laggy crap game with too much random LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to be  E sports  and alot of people playing itFun game good concept bad in most other ways
 Resolved a bug where bullets would sometimes ignore armor  Yeah you did LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    it even got worse  Getting killed by an dude with two AK shots while i have a level 2 Kevlar and a level 3 Helmet Same goes for the Hackers you ban 700000 on one weekend and 1000000 come back on mondayIf the Game goes out of early access in this state then i wish you well in maintaining a  mixed  review of the game
I have played almost 100 hours on this game and I feel like I have a good idea of the game by nowPRO   Very fun game style   Maps are built amazingly with all the buildings being able to be entered  Good options on a variety of weaponsCON   Hackers have been ruining the game and the developers aren t doing much to stop it but thats about it                                                                               Game is very fun especially if you have someone to play with you can kill multiple hours without even realizing it Hopefully the developers will work out the kinks soon but you have to remember that it is still an Alpha game
Millions of bugs
Buy this game and you will get 1 Lots of rage2 Lots of people that speak different languages in the NA servers3 A hell of a lot of fun4 Terrible team mates5 A good game
If you want to play fortnite and you re not gay get this game
THOSE WHO WANT TO BUY READ THIS FIRST  6 months ago I had faith on this one now Idk one thing they could improve is the optimization to game I could play solid 100fps GTA Online with modders going wild in the server but which in terms of graphic is 10x better While this game gives me 60 70 on low except ultra textures not to mention the lag drop in between match GAH About hackers I don t wanna say anything They play their biggest market in China different mindset of people throughout the world might offense each other So it s their own condition to solve However when the time comes I am 100  sure this will be enjoyable as we first played this game
This game is absolutely broken The community is cancer The hit boxes are broken DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE IT WILL NEVER BE FIXED
please create bot mode so i can play calmly without any cheater banning 6k players my asssssssss Teamkiller chinese LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE er region lock pls
fake and gay
Some people may tell you that this game is broken repetitive and overall unfit for purchase before the game is fit but i would tell you otherwise You can have fun with this game with or without friends The game has unforgettable experiences from funny deathsglitches to epic Chicken Dinners New updates add things to be excited about and new mechanics extremely often The game has beautiful long range shooting mechanics and amazing graphics   If you re computer can handle them Overall I would recommend this game to any competitive gamer looking for a Battle royale type game
So far my experience with this game has been fantastic One of the most fun games I ve ever played As the game continues to improve and change I will give a full review
Its pretty terrible With my 1400euro laptop 60 fps optimization 0 Laggy crashes very often takes huge amount of memory lots and lots of cheaters I mean wtf  This game is so overrated Would never payed 30euros for this crappy game
i dont know why everyone is disliking this game it is so fun to play with my friends and crack jokes and all around have a good time
Timeline of the evolution of my review July  Wow really addictive gameplay lots of rough edges but those will be patched soon September  Bullets being blocked by fences but only on one side getting hung up on laggy doors random disconnects low tick rate is starting to wear on me Good thing a patch was promised in Q4 October  Why the heck is vaulting taking so long to implement  Why do test dates keep getting pushed back  Why are they wasting their time on an Xbox One version  Why did it take forever for leaderboards to get reset November  What is wrong with me   Why am I still playing this  FIX IT NOWProbable December 2017 review  This is a trash game made by trash people for other trash people like myself who keep playing it anywaysActual December 2017 review  They actually did it They hit their deadline for December Amazingly they managed to fix the rubberbanding and the memory leaking crashing On top of it we get the endless entertainment of laughing at videos of the Xbox One port
Horribly optimized but great and addictive gamethough
This is the best early access game I ve ever played  3
Best Footstep simulator 2018 Weapon Skins suck balls btw
All people talking about hackers and lags  but this shi is in every game They fix all problems fast  not immediatly but still fast  I played this game not too much time  but i consider that people are just to bad for this game  it s realy difficult  if you have bad pc or internet  you have no chance  to owned people I played 16 years Counter Strike  and i consider  that using granades give you huge advantage against people who dont use it  or use not corecrtly In pubg people very rare use flush granades or others  and thay talk about cheaters  and find other excuses why they cant win  I can say that this is the best shooter game  finnally it must to be I advice this game to all people who want to learn how to beat fear
Version 10 shouldnt have LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing rubberbanding issues that it never had before Server sided LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing rubber banding that makes you fly off a building because LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you
Needs fixing
good and fun game to play with friends
bruh
Full of bugs laggy as all hell extremely frustrating in every techincal aspect   yet the most fun multiplayer game of the year
yes best game many wins
It s a fun game to play with friends but there are some MAYOR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing issues with it Laggy servers FPS drops even with high end PCs A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of bugs The deafening sounds of the rain plane or cars Salty community Cheaters LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  menuI do recommend buying this game but only if you dont mind raging on a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing videogame

So PUBG  Player Unknown s Battlegrounds is one of the most hyped games in the WORLD even in beta it can be better than many games  As every single thing there are positive and negative aspects in PUBG    TOP 3 POSITIVE ASPECTS    Variety Most of the games are repetitive however PUBG is not one of them In every game there are lots of possibilities and situations which makes PUBG a dynamic game influencing players to adapt themselves in each situation Shooting and mechanical system PUBG s Shooting system is the main atraction of the game so it had to be good and IT IS AWESOME So satisfying and clean all hitboxes are basically perfect PUBG s game mechanic is as awesome as the shooting system for those who don t know the game mechanic is what makes it different and authentic I have played many FPS and Battle Royale games but no one has such a good system In PUBG there are pans that can defend you from bullets there are scopes  2x 4x 8x red dot holographic  and there are so many tactic in each game which makes the game more difficult but also more dynamic  Graphic One of the most important things in a game is the graphic PUBG s graphic is amazing The vegetation in general buildings texture and my prefered one the sea graphic makes us more excited to play it  Congrats to PUBG team the graphic is amazing   TOP 3 NEGATIVE ASPECTS    Rendering problems PUBG requires so much RAM for rendering the map I have 12RAM and it still don t render perfectly most of the time FPSPUBG is not a game that everyone can play because it requires an awesome config but it s expensive too you guys could make some things softer like  Vegetation in general make the texture a little bit more simple and things like that  Create a graphic mode like that would be nice But the people who has an awesome config could keep playing in high graphics Training It s not a 100  negative point but a sugestion You guys could create a training mode for those who can t shoot or adapt themselves to most of the game situations  A game that if you die you instantly spawn again in a random place of the map or a place that you choose RAM and RENDERING chart    RAM Does it render well    8 No   12 It depends   16 Yes Discussions_QuoteBlock_Author

Before you read  there is a small TL DR section down at the bottom Just read these first couple paragraphs the fourth  longest one is just my voice on a small few factors in this game Great game Very tactical can be rage inducing Requires a lot of skill to play and winning is not easy This game is very hard and fun and it also is thrilling It really gets to you when you are in the top 10 Your heart really starts racing it s rough Would definitely recommend buying this if you were considering it Ok recently Ive experienced problems There are crashes and hackers and as stated below this is not something that will turn me from this game Developers cant patch all cheats Below is a quick overview of a couple pros and cons Just me voicing my opinion Recently Ive been crashing multiple times a day I crashed probably 4 times each day for the past week all were due to bad_module_info has stopped working This has become even more prominent in the more recent updates I still love the game as much as I did before as almost all of these problems are due to occur sometime throughout a games history I honestly think that the devs are working hard to fix I see the updates quite commonly Some are server patches some are client But every few days I see a server patch No game is perfect so even with a few flaws I forgive them I am disgusted by the people who give bad ratings to a game where servers are overwhelmed with cheaters Most of these are from China and obviously not all cheats can be patched Video game cheats will remain forevermore Its disgusting and the quickest fix right now is a region lock or ping lock on China Just something to keep them in their own servers they get on NA and ruin my games every dayTL DRPros  fun  thrilling  tactical  team based  large scale  good time drain  new experiences each match  EVERY MATCH AND SCENARIO IS DIFFERENTCons  cheaters  China  crashes  server lag  hardware intensiveAlmost all of these cons are in each game you find out on steam No game is perfectIve experienced a lot in my time playing nearly 450 hours at the time of editing my previous review Was at under 100 hours when I wrote this initial reviewIts your judgment if you want to buy this game or not but I highly recommend it
Trash Game rate 57 Recommend to single virginsPS  I m only writing this cuz the servers are again down
Here a negative review is given for 3 reasonsEveryone knows and agrees with the first two The cheaters and the stupid physicsThe third reason is the increased blue zone damage during the mid game The increased damage makes good luck more important and post a great disadvantage to the players landed far from playzone and dont have vehicles spawning nearby Sometimes you waste 20 minutes of your spare time by dying out of playzone without out having contact with anyone just because the RNG is not happy with you
It s a good game Me and my friend play duos all the time and I ve never experienced a hacker or cheater during my days playing There are a few bugs and glitches and it s not optimized very good All that aside it s still in early access and I can see things getting much nicer and smoother
Very Good game will be beter in the close future i hope
geam is gud but you know is hard when LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  assholl
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimization i have ever seen
everyone is china man
99  Waiting to get shot 1  getting shot Not great graphics Nice maps though
Needs a lot of work I have a GTX 1080 an I7 7700k and 16 gb of ram and still get 30 50 fps in citys But overall this game is a blast to play with friends and i can only see it getting better from here
it fun lol
One of the greatest games I ve ever played This game is still rough around the edges but worth the cost all day This game puts you in directly life or death firefights with only found objects It encourages multiple fights throughout the game by decreasing the play area size and forcing people into close quarters Game play and game mechanics are still lacking but I m sure those things will be straightened out eventuallyMany of the game shortfalls can be overcome by tweeking the video settings Everything should be set to lowest with the exception of Anti Aliasing and view distance Make those changes and you can see people from much further away without laggingI highly recommend this game60 hours in and I m still pretty terrible It takes a lot of practice so log in daily to get better Team up with your friends and play in duo mode or as a squad of 4 Adreneline pumping and nerveracking awesomeness awaits
     PUBG 
In its current state it is hardly even worth playing Great game but I can t play through one game without running into cheating anymore
excellent game way better then Fortnite
I think it very good
many hackers in this sh t game
this game unplayable since the latest 2gb updatethis game was ran very good before the update though the update will make this game better but notkeep getting crashed in every game and i had to kill it with task managerand i cant continue my gameJoin the official discord but no answerthumbs down
As long as you don t suffer self destructive thoughts don t buy this gamefull of bugs glitches which will randomly occur and will closee your game full of cheaters which will kill only your game experience and the best of all when somebody kills you while you are behind a wall already and why is that  most probably because they rented the servers which run on 386 computers very bad performance and due to this your whole damn game is delayed
When i start the game i can just click on refresh settings and close the game and not start a game and any things else i try the test server andit still not work why it s happend  
Top game for the boys on the weekend having beers
This game is horribly optomised If you didnt spend 800 on your pc then you can forget playing this game My build is a budget build I only spent about 500 on it How ever i can play Star Wars Battle Front 2 on ultra settings without any lag So the fact that this game is unplayable for me is infuriating Ill be back when the game is actually playable
THIS GAME LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SUCKS BALLZ
Well I had a long review that took an hour to write before But I have something MUCH MUCH more important to say about this game now 
Meh deeeeck cent hendle desEdit  Meh deeeec cen neow hendle des
FIX YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME YOU GREEDY SON OF A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ES  CHEATERS LEFT RIGHT AND CENTER                                                                 20182017 AWARD WINNING CHEATER SIMULATOR
I know I m just joining the crowd on this one bu this game is a JOKE What a sorry excuse for a game The amount of cheating that is going on is ridculous I understand that the developers say they re cracking down in it but when I can hit someone 8 TIMES  2 with a Kar98 to the head and they don t die yet they can kill me with a few shots from an AK while I have a level 3 vest and helmet it s enough to make me give up on this game If I could refund this I would I m sure once the game is finished then it ll be awesome but good luck waiting for that to happen For the record I never review things but this has happened too many times in this game to not say anything about it
I can t get off of this game and I ve played it thousands of times most likely Good pointer to this game is that although you can jump over things its still not very fluid but is going to be updated prior to the games release including a climbing mechanism for walls too high to jump overIf you ve no friends to play with I d reccommend taking a look over at AOD for friends to play with and enjoy this game even more  
Great fun especially if you pick it up with your friends Will take some time to get used to everything and lots of deaths but it s worth itedit  Too frustrating cant play fun
This game is great you just have to be really talentedPSMake sure to look at controls before you play
Buggy and cancerous as all hell
The Best game to PVP
can t even play the game LOADING till the endLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game
gta 1jibatm
I didn t like the way tht therz no zoombees i fought there wold b The guns make good gun noyses and the players are dead  Get this game if you like shooting and stuff with guns but not if you want to play somethingg like the sims or wicher 3All in all an excellent forray into the world of battle royale  I like this you should to bu t  you might not get it
Overrated Laggy Chaotic Infuriating TrashThis is what happens when the wrong people come up with a good game conceptPlayer unkown should go back to making arma mods and Bluehole should just stick to making mobile games Props for trying But this is just cancerThe only thing that can make this game borderline bearable is playing squads with friends There is absolutely no room for competetive edge or improvement when network lag and low frame rates irrespective of the hardware and graphic settings are literally considered a normal part of the gameplay that most of the community has just accepted and gotten used to at this point  Crashes on an hourly basis  usually its just the game simply dying completely out of the blue but sometimes the game just freezes on screen not even allowing opening the task manager and requiring a full system restart to fix this would be bad for some niche indie game but for something this big and popular its just completely unacceptable   Network lag  Things like Opening doors Reloading weapons Shooting Picking up items etc etc LITERALLY ALWAYS FEEL LAGGY The most infuriating part is the amount of lag seems as though it is calculated precisely to make it just infuriating enough to make the players complain but not quit even though complete temperory disconnections are still inevitable  Rubberbanding   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  physics  trying to jump on to something is just a hit or miss nightmare and no while vaulting is useful it is not the solutionreplacement to broken jumping mechanics its just too slow when you press  W  and  space  together from a stand still you should jump forward not up its not that difficult to figure out and don t even get me started on vehicles  Blasphemous hit registry  getting killed AFTER getting behind cover from the direction of oncoming fire is another one of those  So normal its basically a feature  things  Other Glitches  including but not limited to  falling though the map vehicles getting stuck inside walls and exploding even on slow impacts hitting  nothing  and flipping while driving updownhill etc  Hackers  There s too many of them and most of the time you wont even know you have encountered one and just feel bad for not being good enough  Irrespective of what server you join half of it will ALWAYS be filled with Screaming Chinese people using microwaves for microphonesNobody asked for a new map Fix all of this first310
this game is so much better than fortnite
trash game ban hackers shot gun  more like youre not even shooting and this game comes out on xbox full release in december  lol trash
Hey guys i know this game have some major problem but is very good if you wanna have fun with your friends and play a battle royale tipe game rly i recommend
to many cheaters 
LEGEDARY GAME  DDD
Jealous PLAYERUNKNOWN stopped me from quickscoping everyone lost connection to server after I massacared 4 scrubs
fantastic game Please ignore all the downvotes They are not selling out People cried for skins so devs added a new paid crate and now everyones screaming sellout The game is improving by the day Isuue concerning hackers is being resolved people DONT realize its early access so of course it is not going to be running insanely smooth that comes with early access Would HIGHLY recommend this game
good game if they could ever fix all of the issues with it crashing in the middle of a game
This game has a lot of potential  butt its is just another greedy attempt of greatness by unqualified company Negatives Adding micro transactions Esport wtf  not ready not fixing the basic gameplay bad servers not updating the game like promised not adding new content cheaters and bad anti cheat system  horrible optimization whole game feels like titanic ready to sink unstable afAsking more money but not giving anythingButt it still early access so we will seeWell the game is  whole  now The full release is here and if i could get a refund for this game i would
BUGGY TERRIBLE HIT DETECTION TERRIBLE NETWORK PERFORMANCE DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY
The game is ok But they need to do higher drops more weapons etc EVERBODY GETS A WEAPON EANYWAY SO DO HIGHER DROP SO EVERBODY IS SAME AND CAN FIGHT
Game is still buggy especially the car mechanics but improving and its way too gpu demanding hoping for optimization soonGreat game never played a battle royale and glad this is the first battle royale game i have played although i am quite bad i still enjoy it
Great concept poor executionLike other players say there are a lot of issues that are not being fixed by devs Don t buy this game wait for a AAA publisher to make a better versionPros   Fun in concept no other game can capture the battle royale quite the same way yetCons   Server lag and packet loss when performing basically every action Severely impacts gameplay and responsiveness eg picking up a gun on the ground is slow and sometimes firing reactionary shots don t connect and you will die as the enemies shots do connect  Graphics from 2005 but game still runs like sh t and overheats your PC  Devs completely asleep at the wheel not fixing anything only occasionally adding weapons
Badly optimised and desynch issues this game is still in Beta mode for me
Lags bugs but hell lotta fun It sucks you inPerformance needs to get better
HACKERS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HACKERS EVERYWHERE
not bad at all 
this game keep cant  process  after i win 1 game
Minecraft is more esport ready than this game seriously the bugs and hacking problem is rubbish and crash every two days       esport ready                 fix ur damn game first before trying to go esport
PUBG this game is playing a game always update and never see what you have updated the hall open hanging still have after April 19th update into the game can enter the game can not enter the game to submit mistakes you are not in time to deal with what LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  company go to your mother s blue hole
Game is amazing
sukcs the game always crash stoping update the game
Full of hackers
Crash everytime Please fix it
I loved this game until Blue Hole stopped caring about the game and more about the moneyHackers are everywhere now 3 games today 3 deaths to hackers Don t dare talk about hackers in the subreddit or forumsPlay a North America game everyone speaks Chinese which is okay but I would like to be able to play with teammates that speak my lang thus why I am playing on North AmericaPut a region lock on the game hardware ban hackers and work on fixing the hit reg systems and I d change my reviewI ll still play the game but just like KOTK if a new game comes out that makes up for what pubg is lacking I am gone
Great game concept Horrid executionEdit  finally optimised this thing but servers still run under 20 tick so still dont buy this gameEdit 2  Last test tickrate  17 Shotguns completely stopped registering  10th January 2018
2000Game over This game is going to be yellow You can t live with good fun Open stores are rampant The most important thing is that the game operators don t have to hang up you don t need a reason Operator is king Is the biggest immortal I have a bold guess operators will not be prepared for the last volume of money and then withdraw from the Chinese market or run directly on it 
hackers kill this game
Great game i love itNever dissapointed me
I really love this game but there are two difficulties for someone who is new You need a good pc and also there is many bugs which are irritating such as getting stuck on the ground because your pixels aren t loaded when you land
Very fun game that never gets old paying only gets you cosmetic gear that is worth purchasing if you are into cosmetics but doesn t change gameplay
plz regionlock for the love of god
This is the best 2017 FPS TPS game ever
Jumping out of a vehicle at 3mph should not kill you1010 Motion Blur is disabled by defaultAlso the changes of getting a kill in this game are about 05  chance the chance of dying to a kill is at 09  chanceAlso you have to coordinate your landings  Best played with friends also
I only have 88 hours of gameplay and i have seen more hackers in that time than in 750 hours of CSGO
This game is so broken its just pathetic Constantly hitting invisible walls when I need to run wont fire guns when I m spamming to fire Looting is garbage Game should be seeling for 10 at most They aren t improving anything either They are just trying to get this game out to as many platforms as possible until a actual good BR game is made to replace them
This game is full of chinese people and hackers Also it s unoptimized RNG trash
better invest in something else
  ipdog    pc          
Very fun game  u will need some skills or good headphones  lol
One of the Best Games ever created
Seems legit that you can stand behind a motorbike and survive after a jeep rams into it 1010

siria simulator 2018
very fun game  however it needs ALOT of work still it is getting better bit by bit but  Hackers Lag and dying around corners is a regular i kind of dont want to leave a bad review but i got no choice  CHEERS 
Very very nice game the best version from MW series Absolutely amazing feeling Good job 
Want to experience a cheater in every match you play  Want to run 20fps on a 1070  Want to experience server lag worse than dial up  Then this is the game for youFor now don t buy this game
 Lack of updates with game breaking bugs Nothing done about hackers Hackers Top the LB for weeks at a time Constant moving of the goalposts so you don t have to fulfill promises Dev is inexperienced and does not understand how to use the tools in unreal e
Game is Bad30 Bucks I mournI d rather Jerk to Gay porn
IT NEED REAL CASH TO UNLOCK CRATES   FUUK YOU IM UNINSTALLING

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game that s full of chinese hackers
This should be funSo yeah great game Great concept Every match is different except for one little part YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  SERVERSWHY DONT YOU TAKE ALL THE MONEY YOUVE MADE AND INVEST IN SERVERS THAT DONT LAG EVERY 27357 SECONDS IT D MAKE THE GAME MUCH MORE ENJOYABLEYeah that s about it 35 Good game
Making a lot of money but still cant fix optimization problems well done very well done
Amazing game and the funnest on the world
Even tho this game crashes due to lack of RAM but still giving a thumbs up and worth buying for
i5 8gb Randeon r9  Lag on this game It s a nice game and a good ideea but u need to resolve that thing
You give us da poo poo and we eat da poo poo Thought I would have some fun tiems Servers too busy and unstable Chinese hackers Would not buy in current state Save your money
With all of the recent thumbs down for this game I went into it with a preconcieved notion that I was going to be disappointed  I didnt even get to be disappointed because the game doesnt even work  The buttons on the UI dont work if you try to click on them  I literally never got past the start menu because I literally cannot even click the  continue  button  Absolute waste of money  Thank you for stealing from me Bluehole
Hackers Its like cancer
Hackers are everywhere Most of them are chinese but they are everywhere Imagine wasting 20 mins looting killing and everything then you are just going to encounter speedhackers aimbots wallhacks and more it s not that they abandoned the game but they are not doing enough to get rid of hackers
Okay this review will be positive but the thing I say here will be negative Because for the fact that everyone is review bombing this game with negative because they think the game is HORRIBLE because they find a couple things wrong with it and focus on them forgetting about all the good in the game combined with the fact it is actually FUN most of the time  at least for me With that out the way I can get into what I have to sayHURRY UP AND REGION LOCK I DONT WANT  CHINA NUUMBER JUAAAN  AND  HARUCHIMA HARUCHIMA  IN MY FUCJING NA  OCE SERVERS
I promised myself that I would write a review ONLY when I have gotten my first solo Queue Chicken Dinner so here I am 200 Hours into the game and I finally got my first solo queue Chicken Dinner I cant believe it After playing this long I ve never complained about hackers bugs graphics and crashes I dont know why but the only thing that we can do in Battle Royale games is queue try to survive and try to win by being the last one standing Some people may find it boring and very repetitive But this is a good lesson and you will know yourself if you are a competitive person or not as PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS will really help you find out this trait of you trying to get to the very top and working hard for it If you dont believe me get yourself PUBG and try for yourself
i like it zz
Winner winner CHICKEN DINNER
get ready to lag everytime you are in a crucial firefight for your buildings to not load in for 2 minutes after you land d sync and multiple client crashes in an hour Do not recommend until blue balls gets their heads out of their asses
Horribly coded game Honestly how can a company have such success and still let it remain in this sorry state that it is inSeriously get some real coders and start polishing the game already Everyone should boycott this game until it actually is fixed to a playable state
Cant wait for full release but the only bad things are Hackers and the SERVERSSSSS
So it s a mixed review on one side I would say it s the best Battle Royale out there as other competitors chose more arcadish approachon the another side the problem is that in recent weeksmonths this game got infested with cheatershackers you would rarely find match without a cheater in it as before of course you would find some cheaters  but not so often but nowadays it s close to every lobby with at least one cheater in itSo if you don t mind dealing with huge influx of cheaters then go on buy it if not wait maybe devs will manage to do something about it
chinese hackers everywhere
Only 2 cons i have about this game is 1 it requires a good pc to play it 2 they gotta figure out a way to patch the hacks awayyyy from the game they got banned but they are coming back again and againPros are 1 u can connect to all the servers and be able to play with ur friends from different country without crazy delays which not much games can do that2 its battle royal  hunger games WHY NOT3 the chicken dinner is so addictiveI can see they are trying to improve the game each update might not end up being a good update all the time but hey they are working real hard on it devs keep it up
I really love this game I honestly think its better than Fortnite although you would have to play a week to a month to get decent or even a chicken dinner  First Place or win
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME  DEVS ARE ALLOWING HACKING DUE TO PROFITSHackers purchase game with real money one timeHackers play and win every game with massive amounts of kills giving them a ridiculous amount of BP  in game currencyHackers use BP to get crates and sell itemsHackers use money made from sold items to buy new game once bannedEndless cycle occurs and Bluehole LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s make money This game is so broken and the Devs dont give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at all
The game is pretty good for early access There are issues with the delay of the action though
game is fun although they really need to do something about the hackers encouter them in almost every game
terrible gameplay and physics refunded
I just wasted 30 for this trash This game must be renamed to  Being a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and hide like you do in real life also  This game is slow and its made for mentally LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ppl who like to hide and run away from the action I will highly recommend you to get H1Z1 instead of this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t  DONT BUY THIS GAMEHalf year later the game is still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  everyone is still being a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Go play Fortnite instead of this trash its free and its better Also there are less LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  with down syndrome hiding in the houses
Those LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bugs makes this game completely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Driving on a road and suddenly the car just gets stuck into something and explode Driving the 3 sited bike and suddenly you get stuck in some wierd angels and Explode Stuck in a fence with the 3 sited bike and guess WHAT  EXPLODE Shoting ppl in the head and all over them then some mean LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  called  D sync  hits you in the back and your opponent wins Have a few record of that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  happening And thats just a few bugs i have encounterd
Persistent issues with server performance especially early in the game simple issues such as loot spawning a long time after you land in contested areas are still not fixed rubberbanding inside vehicles is present now too which I assume is because vehicle physics were moved to a server authoritative model coupled with the low tickrate  despite cheaters with flying vehicles still being present    Networking in general is not exactly reliable how many things implemented are questionable  the higher your ping is the harder it is to heal inside a moving vehicle which should be a completely server side thingThe test server seemingly has no real purpose no matter how broken an update is it will still get pushed to the live serversI would not recommend the game until the servers perform consistently the gameplay critical elements are purely server authoritative and the random stuttering asset streaming and input latency issues that keep returning after updates are permanently fixed It feels like the game servers are being hosted on the cheapest AWS server solution despite Unreal Engine 4 requiring quite a bit of single threaded performance to run properly given its underlying design not being a modern data oriented architecture but a bloated object oriented model with reflection bloat and such I do not believe the servers will ever run better unless hosted on more powerful hardware or Bluehole  PUBG Corp takes the time to essentially re write Unreal Engine 4 s core systems  which I doubt will happen
Really enjoyable game Great fun A lot of bugs and unoptomised stuff with it though but that s just EA It will come
In its current state i cannot recommend this game You need at least a gtx 1050ti or 1060 to even run LOVE LOVE LOVE  at 60fps at anything above potato settings Even with my 1060 i have lag spikes and often i have to wait for buildings to load in leaving me completely helpless for crucial minutes at the start of the gameAs for hackers i ve only ran into one but that might be to do with exclusively going on EU serversI cannot decide wether the game is fun or not On one hand you spend about 70 80  of the time walking around picking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  up of the floor and running towards the new zone then you have gunfights which most of the time amounts to getting sniped from people ages away from you However when you do get a kill it s immensively satisfying and when you actually win the game its incredibly rewarding This game can fill me with adrenaline like no other game playing solos the other day there was only one person left and my heart was beating out of my chest I lost in the end but i had to have a break because of the rush of adrenaline i felt right at the end when i almost won against 99 other peopleso basically game sux 8D
Its  awesome  Though  its in early stage and many thing needs to be optimized  Great concept thumbs up
veruy good
Overhang server instabilityLa matenio foriris
Why the hell are there ads in game menu  And because of the ads the UI is broken I can t even start a game Buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  frame rate incredibly low comparing with other games with the same graphics  the animations are not polished The gameplay is totally great But now this game have millions of people playing this game  the UI and the  game itself is still this broken BTW this is the only non F2P game I have seen that have ADs Oh yeah when there s a refresh button on the main menu that allows u to reload the main menu when it s not responding you know that the coding for the UI sucks and that shouldn t happen to a game with this many players Again the gameplay is totally ufn but the game is just not polished PUBG has so many players now BlueHole should have enough money to fix all these major issues But they didn t this just gives me a feeling that either the devs doesn t want to spend the time resource and effort to fix the issue or they just don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to anything besides money
Very nice except for a few bugs
This game had a great premise Battle Royale It was one of the only games of its type when it was released which led to it being a massive hit within the gaming community Sadly Bluehole has mostly abandoned their monthly updates and have broken promises such as microtransactions which came in the form or gamescom crates The game is horribly optimized for running on Unreal Engine 4 The gunplay while interesting is shoddy at best with the client side hit detection not catching everything it should Some guns are almost completely unplayable like shotguns and pistols The worst part however is the rampant hacking that happens almost every game I have experienced multiple hackers and it completely ruins the gameplay Overall the game premise of Battle Royale is amazing Bluehole however needs to fix a hell of a lot of things that should take priority like hit detection optimization and cheaters
If you want to play this game you need to speak MandarinDo not buy this game until the do something about China and the Hackers                                    
What an embarrassment of a gameHonestlyMatching for 30min to pair with someone who speaks the same language Only to crashWait till this goes F2PP2W

Everyone seems to be waiting on the Xbox version to come out so they won t have to deal with hackers  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that fix the PC version we paid forUpdate  10 is almost out and things are looking much better I have seen basically no hackers that I can legit call bs on  Miramar is an amazing map and I will update this review to a recommend after I test 10Update 2  Many improvements came about after the release of 10 the game still needs a lot of work mainly in developing effective anti cheat measures server tick rate and optimization
Hacker Unknown Battlegrounds
As of Update 14 VERY pleased with the state of the game and the server lag is comparable to CSGO Well worth
Get this Down To One rip off outta here

Definitely recommend this game I might only have a mere 66 hours in this game at the time of writing but I have come across one hacker in that time that I was confident about Sure the game needs optimisation but my PC is awful and I can still play the game fine Besides optimisation tho the game is very fluent the right amount of time per game choice of instant action or playing sneaky beaky good choice of weaponry good inventory system movement which is strange at first but you soon get used to and oh so satisfying when you get that delicious chicken dinner  of which I have had 5
Buggy broken and a waste of your time until fixed
Its super laggy on my HP Omen gaming laptop i dont get why its so laggy game looks fun but i cant enjoy it when its super laggy and keep getting killed cause of the lag  
Been killed by hackers four matches in a row now The latest match i saw an obvious hacker using speedhack

Possibly the best game I ve played in the genre of Survival Shooter Intense AF
Too many asians but good game I give 1011 would suck again
just nope read other reviews
do not buy if u want to keep ur sanity
Can t play to many lag bags not good game waste of money
Not one hacker found in my servers so far It seems EUW is clean All and all it s a pretty awesome game and apart from it s obvious buggs and some hard around the edges gameplay it s still more decent then some AAA games like GTA V or Battlefield 1 A thrilling ride and a fast learning curve Just pls work on the aiming mechanics and make our characters a little more agile on the batteground
15  killing spreeHACKER S BATTLEGROUNDS
PUBG devs have taken a similar path to the CSGO devs They care more about releasing loot boxes and skins than the actual gameplay I ve played since the beta and currently have 380  hrs on PUBG and Id recommand playing another game such as Fortnite than spending money on this game The game is in decline updates occur far too slow no meta changes and no respect given to players from devs
I hate it when it shows  servery busy   everytime I attempt to play a game I hit refund
my game dont working
i want this game in ios X_X
Really poor quality game desync makes it almost unplayable The MASSIVE ammountof money that has been generated by this game is mind boggling even more so the totallack of improvement in the base product in the last few months despite astronomical revenueVery disappointing not worth a thumbs up
I apologize for the bad English Thanks to Google for translating my text  Dear PLAYERUNNNOWN I am writing you from the far north western part of the Russian Federation or just from the Republic of Karelia My name is Andrey I am 22 years old I m one of your big supporters after you ve changed the game to ArmA 3 and I m sorry to say that I ve been wrong for a long time and I still believe this is a breakthrough in the game industry there is a rule that they must kill each other in finding something in this region and this mode is called Battle Royal is not it cool For you I decided to learn more about the King s War  two films of the same name and all kinds of trash The American films are  Convicts  and  Hunger Games  but it s not boring to read a few books in a similar genre I learned a lot about healing in different conditions Maybe one day will be useful but I hope Thank you for thatAnd now maybe I ll go to the root of the problem because I m writing this review On the contrary when I was a regular fashion designer I did not write about it But now I have a serious company and I m sure you have a lot of money when selling this wonderful game you won So buy more servers and if possible put them in Russia Search game waited 10 minutes got angry went to an hour s grocery store came back wait the game is still looking How do you know  I spent 120 of my wages playing but I can not play And it s still poorly optimized  in the main menu in the low graphics settings I have a slide show Right pleaseI hope you will love
so many hackers and glitch
Solid 57
anovu  nice game withmore and more cheaters sikimaki  
Best battleroyale game out thereShure with some bugs and glitches but overall really enoyableIT S ALPHA Most of the negative comments are from people getting banned because they improved cheat detectionI would buy it again if you don t have it BUY IT
Naked and Afraid
Nice Game MF
You re just sitting in the chair absorbed in this game so deeply then half of your day went away  Despite of many negative reviews it is a good game though sure it still has couple of bugs yet  however they re working on it continuously eventually this is the early access about isn t it  So keep up the good work
This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  The developers are crap It s addictive but it s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like the poker machines in a casino Don t buy this crap
No weather in game anymore and they refuse to give public full access to the game including map selection
Ok here is my thoughts after a couple days playtime This game is a darn amazing accomplishment They managed to take most of what we loved from the day z mod and boil it down to its base roots Nemely a no holds barred kill fest Kill on sight Kill as fast as you can And do anything you can NOT toi get killed Huge mapcheck About 100 p layerscheck Realistic feeling weapons and vehiclescheck I can t speak really for rampant cheatring because I don t get to hung up on trying to find out who is cheating and who isn t However I can say that out of the many times I have been killed it certainly looks and feels like every death was legit In my opinion this is one of the best games I have played to date And  can see why it has become a bit of a phenomenon
Even better than CSGO This game is so amazing Well done
Cant fix their servers Its very laggy and you join servers with a  normal  ping of 20000 This is not a triple A game
I purchased this game beleiving that it would be good given it s ratings and so on While I understand that it s in alpha I find that I cannot enjoy the game as a result of it s core mechanics After 30 or so people are the only ones left it forces you into a smaller playzone and it becomes a campfest of who has the better ping Not to mention that the game is inherently biased to a certain side for peeking and you cannot  easily at least switch your POV during a peek thus advantaging the camperAll in all I cannot enjoy the game in it s current state
Very fun game but at the same time it can be a frusturating experience  Cheaters poor optimization low framerate spikes and bugs will undoubtedly ruin a few games and will overall affect player experiences for the worse  but it has real potential once it s finished  if the near logrithmic rise hasn t already proven that latter point  However the battle royale gamemode will most likely be perfected by another more prepared developer if bluehole and playerunknown keep spending their time planning esports tourneys rather than worrying about the sub par netcode desync s and a smorgasbord of bugs  I would recommend getting in now if you can t wait  I couldn t but I would be surprised if we don t see a similar battleroyale gamemode running on Frostbite or IW engines someday soon
very nice game despite of random glitches and bugs but is still early access so okunplayable though due to massive number of hackers
Cheaters are not punished
Stay away until the devs do something about the cheaters there are way too many of them and the devs are doing nothing Espaimbot and no recoil hacks like crazy just about every game
I payed 30 to see Servers are busy 
hey cool kid
soooo awesome
This game upsets me
Like it spent way to much time playing but somethings I would want them to add sooner
Non Optimized idiot game
Amazing game its a challenge but its hella Fun csgo players might find it easyier
bad bugs
Netcode is garbage Devs are pushing e Sports and loot crates Hackers galore Please EA make a good version of this so I can drop this piece of steaming LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Its a good game but please if there is a bug or crash please fix it officially fast
they need to fix alot
requires 200 IQ
At it s current state buying this game is a big mistake Speedhackers aimbots and every kind of hacker is present in 99  of the matches NA SA OC EU servers are flooded by Asian people most of them don t even understand English or Spanish in any way When the game came out I would go in the NA servers and find cool people to play with sometimes now I just find Asians who can t understand me properly Same with SA servers when I wanted to play with other Spanish speaking players I would go into the SA servers but now it s just Asian People Asian people should be banned from playing on foreign servers That s it also get a better anticheat system fix the bugs fix the graphics and the game could be good
improve core performance please
terrible interface terrible lag
good game but buggy
Seriously  250 for a key to unlock a duplicate skin that you can only sell for 30BP Thats complete trash Someone deserves to be punched in the face for this
Ta piola pero re motonono dps d 1 rato te re embolas y colgas mal y queres reembolsar y te das cuenta que no eran 2h y 1 dia eran 20 horas y 1 mes
full of cheaters server issuesssssssss
Please update the minimum requirements If anyone playing PUBG is running on them they ll lose 90  of their games due to the game not having loaded any buildings or items even and thus having you unable to do anything but get killed
used to love this game and play it a lot now i can barely enjoy a game without a hacker last game i played with someone who killed LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 70 people in a squads game and me and my buddy were left alone with 10 alive on the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing second safe zone and i keep on running into similare hackers the devs are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE tting us and the servers are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  so i can t recommend this game a lot anyLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ingmore
Concept is great Developers are clueless morons who break things every time they try to fix things Game runs awful and I have zero confidence they will fix it Lag Desync stuttering you name it Chalk this up as another Ark or DayZ
Not done revew yet
This game is so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing riddled with bugs all the devs do is tweet about there numbers and add new content while not perfecting the content already ingame I also hate how you knock the same person multiple times and they can just keep getting revived over and over again there should be a limit Like you can only get knocked by the same person a certain amount of times The Engine you use for this game is litteraly so easy to hack a brain dead animal can do it Your report system is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you have no software that is able to detect hackers efficiently this game is doomed and is just a temporary source of fun
game could be so good if they actually worked on optimizing the pos
I will be uninstalling PUBG after 440 hours until a new update possibily fixes the game I have run this game at 1440p medium settings with no problems then when the most recent update came out it has rendered my game completely unplayable In the plane is a contant 5 to 0 fps completely freezing the game then when it forcefully drops me out of the plane because I am not able to jump out WHEN I WANT it completely freezes about 80  of the way down Making me wait 5 plus minutes for ANYTHING to even jump over 5 fps This is practically scamming at this point I have seen NO OTHER game have these problems and it is quite ridiculous at this point
You know what this game is by now just buy it
such a shity game now
at least its better than fortnite
Are u really good at shooters  play this If u arent Walk away Save yourself the torture
This game was good but the hackers are out of control  Every other game there is a speed hacker who just head shots everyone  I wouldn t recommend this game until a real solution is found
3 out of 4 games played today killed or was on a team with hackers right now the game is a joke to me
this game is truely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  don t get it on my screen i shoot him so much it looks like he s on a peroid but on replay he only took 1 shotatleast it s slowly dying thank LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
First of all I want to point out that what I am criticizing today is entirely subjective and based upon my personal experience with the game I am open to critizism if you wish upon ranting Let s beginIt s a great concept executed decently at the beginning It s a game where you can expect hundreds upon hundreds of well deserved hours both alone or with friends I have had endless amounts of funny moments playing with myself  not in that way and friends Yes When I play there has been some frustrating moments experiencing lag relatedhacking issues But it has never been as horrible as it s now That s what this review will focus on today Positive aspects have been named countless times There is no need for me mentioning them in that case Hackers I have no words for this It s pathetic ruining the experience for the obeying players If Bluehole made an effort to damp their numbers it woudn t be as excessive as it s now Im not going to drop accusations of being greedy on their team but implementing protocols and not lying for the players about banning hackers would make quite some progress Optimization Since launch it has not been improved If you are thinking about buying this game please consider waiting You need quite a beefy desktop to reach atleast 40 50 fps at all times The reason I need to include this aspect is because it has gone such a long time since launch Still not fixed a single bit Clientserver side Let s set up a scenario Top 20 You re being shot at so you throw yourself in cover You die You scratch your head thinking about ending it all It was crystal clear you got to cover in time yet somehow you managed to die Because the servers are laggy the server side would have shown you getting stomped on out in the open What I am describing here is a new problem It wasn t there to begin with It has most likely developed with time It s quite frustrating playing well then dying to something you have no control over what so everSomething else I need to issue is the rubberbanding Basically you move forward then lag a couple of metres back I have noticed it s way worse in Duos compared to Solo or Squads This sole dysfunctionality has driven me insane a couple of times often resulting in me smashing my table in a blind fury seeking to eliminate every last piece of evidence about BlueholeI think it s time to get into the conclusions Please excuse my rants they were probably not meant for you Around launch which is the time I bought the game these issues were not present Okay the optimizing part was but not the clientserver perspective issues and the hackers I would say give the developers some time to fix these issues Right now I would actually deem this game unplayable and I do absolutely not recommend this game in it s current state
One of the best online multiplayer game i ever play beside gta online
Best 30 ever  3 GG OP
If you have never played this game before don t buy it It is absolutely horrid for new players due to zero ways to learn and practice
My game is crashing please fix it  
I want to took this game and one of my friend refound it   no problem  but now i have 2058euro in account and 2999 from pubg and now i am at my cousin birthday and 5 of them have pubgWhat i am asking is to pay with my 2058euro and 2999 from pending i want to pay with my 2058 euro and the difference from pending

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you
Region block China pleaseBTW I am chinese so it is not racistSorry for all the players in EU NA cheating players form China make me feel ashamedBlue a ss hole fu ck you for doing nothing about thisloser
good game but its hackers nest  S
amazing game outstanding graphics and gameplay if i wasnt constantly trying not to die i could sit back and look at the scenery Think of Hunger Games mixed with GTA where ammo and scopes matter
Woooh never thought I d be the kind of guy to like this kind of game but I do Just beware streamers
Best worst game in the world I am hooked and will keep playing until a better game comes along but until then be wary that the fun of this game only barely outweighs the horrendous issues of optimisation I cannot recommend this game in good conscience until these issues are fixed
After passing 100 hours in this game and having both good and bad times in it I thought I was qualified to give a review Short version conceptweapon variety optimization major server lag due to inadequate servers and excessive traffic from overseas graphics while passable at high would pass for an early 2000s game at a playable framerate if you live in a rural area chances are your internet cannot run this Regardless of ping dependent on download and upload speeds Personally I ve had many cases where 15 20 bullets out of 30 miss at point blank range gunplay feels incredibly clunky movement feels incredibly clunky unfixed exploitscheatshacks allow you to be headshotted anywhere which the overly sensitive banning system hasn t been able to fixOverall I love the concept of this game However I think the developers haven t implemented it well enough to actually recommend this game I may be biased as I m used to other games but the guns feel terrible They re unlike any other game that I ve played and that s not a good thing in this case Emptying 20 30 bullets at point blank range  aiming down sights and hitting the enemy twice isn t exactly a hallmark of good gameplay and that wasn t an isolated incident It s happened with nearly every gun for me I ve played shooters for 8 10 years and this isn t a problem with most other games I ve playedAs much as I want to I have to recommend against getting this game I praise those who become skilled at it but I think most people have neither the location the hardware nor the patience to get a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of itOn a final note fix the Chinese servers before doing huge updates to the game Nearly every time I join a game there are many many overseas players which doesn t do favours for anyone s ping serverwide
i wish i could refund it and kill the creator
This game is the best shooting game I have played in my whole life I recomend getting this game if you have a beast pc and good wifi connection
anyone can help me to fix the battlEye
the euphoria of that first coveted chicken dinner cannot be beat period 1010
Stop the hackers This is unaaceptable and unplayable in the current state
The only reason this game is getting so much hate is casue of the HACKERS are getting in trouble the way it should be
I must say I didn t think much about this game when I first saw it In the end it s really addictive game A lot of fun I like the mechanics I like the fact that one s success in this game depends a lot on luck not only skill and so less skilled players also have a chance to win some roundsAs I see it there are only two downsides Firstly there are a lot of hackers in game these days but I m hopefull that somethink will be done soon about that Second problem is that high latency player are favored over low latency players While it s a good policy it also represents a big problem because people from other parts of world play EU servers and have therefore a advantage over  local  playersOverall this game is really enjoyable especially when playing with friends Definitely worthy investment
The game is crowded with cheaters   specially if you lookup their stats and see something like average KD 2260  Win 546  and then you stop asking  How did this guy jump and give you a headshot at the same time  How did he know you were camping there  How did one person just kill three people with headshot punches in a row without missing This is an absolute great game but in such a game cheaters are much much more game destroying than in any other game
Simply the best FPS since I can remember If you don t have it get it
alright this is my first review of any game on steam  granted I was before steam existed when WON was still a thing for those too young to understand it was called the World Opponent NetworkPubg is a game like no other ive played its fun its exciting it makes me laugh it makes me get intense and it makes me want to play it morenow for the discontentmany aspects of this game are RNG as one of the last games I played the guy dropped where I would consider it a normal drop for me but he found a full set up in less than 30 seconds compared to me with a UMP and a helmet at the same time I drop where he usually drops and I never get the same set up can I blame the game  yes but that would be childish more or less I put it down as bad luck and he got the better set up along with an advantage of heightthis games great it has its bugs but at least they put it as  early access  compared to most saying it s a fully developed game Cant wait for the vaulting patchput more 45 weapons in you drop waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much 45 for the guns available to make it even phesable BTW the UMP in real life is a 45 in most countries the 9mm version is the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  version they put out so EVERYONE could handle it  look at CS GO it s a 45
I play this on PC Usually made top 25  Twice in top 5 Despite aggressive anti cheater efforts the hackers have gradually ruined this game  Aimbot type cheats most common
PUBG is a fun game but there is somethings i hate about it Optimization is bad if you want to run this game on Ultra you need atleast a GTX 1080 but if you have a 1060RX580 your fine but fps is still bad idk for people with a Core 2 Duo and GTX 750 combo but expect to put all your settings on Low  Slow and Clunky when picking up items it so laggy and sometimes even when your dragged it to your inventory it doesn t register sometimes also movement is laggy when ever i try to crouch jump there is a big delay Hackers are more common now compare to the old days of the game i barely even see a hacker back in the old days but now this game is PlayerUnknown s HackerGrounds  Also the game is basically who has a better scope to be honest i can t see LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  without an 8x also loot is hard to find i went to loot 5 buildings and i only got a pistol PUBG is a fun game i really loved it but if they can fix atleast a couple of these i ll play it again and come on this game will be out on Xbox One next month and its not even optimized yet if this game is Optimized and not clunkylaggyand slow then i ll come back to it but for now i ll play some H1Z1 even tho there alot of hackers i still have alot of fun because 1 its optimized 2not slow and clunky 3alot of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fun with friends
Bugs And Hackers everywhere I EVEN HAD A BUG OF MY CONTROLS BEING MIXED UP AND YES I LOOKED AT MY SETTINGSIm LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  off the developers are adding ingame content  cosmeticsgunschests but not the performance of the game Optimization did not change still as buggy or maybe even worse than before 1010 Would Never Play Again
This game is a pice of trash brendon green is a idiot and is only cash thirsty bluehole has the money management of a 4 year old and the don t know what optomization is once so ever Bluehole is as good as valve with hackers and I die constently to them don t buy this game
HACKERS HAVE RUINED THE GAME
helo ples fix game my game shoudnt run GREAT on medum but on low it run so bAd pleas plyerunknowng fix this game
hacker s game garbage gameI never should have bought this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
 J B 
so many hacker
All I can say is  PUBG is suing the company that holds the license to their game engine Unreal Engine Two guesses as to how long this game will continue to be played without an engine to run it Do not purchase this game until the lawsuit is over to see if PUBG can even still continue to function once EPIC GAMES removes their Unreal Engine license
I can t support a company or a game that actually thought it was a good idea to threaten lawsuits on other developers   Almost as lame of a thought as If Mario  tried to sue every side scrolling game ever made  Get over yourselves cucks
I m just reviewing it for the steam badge thanks lol
forttzaaa tataaaaa
Great game concept fun at first however it loads poorly textures are miserable and the hacking is ridiculous  Last several games whole squad wiped by hackers  Until they optimize and up their anticheat system its not worth it
I can play 1 maybe 2 games a week if I m actually able to connect after waiting in the pregame lobby before being disconnected  There have been times where I m still alive in the game and can reconnect so I m not sure why I can t just connect in the first place
CHEATERS in every round This is a great game but the cheaters are ruining the game They are not doing enough to stop people cheating I don t care how many people they ban there are still cheaters every damn day Very unhappy with the games anticheat ability
cheater is so muchexpriene so badly
10 release looks promising
A very strategic game that requires some time and a lot of focus One small mistake could ruin it all
enjoyable for early access I found no huge flaws
I can t believe I paid full price for a game that plays and runs like utter LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is so broken please dont buy this anymore so that they can put some time into fixing this piece of trashEdit   this game is not getting any better time just makes it way worse i cant belieave this
buggy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  cash grab by an awful company hopefully a real company comes by and makes a playable game with the battle royale modelalso for some reason theres an absurd amount of cheaters sprinting at 5000 mph and killing people through walls n   s hit
Despite all the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game gets Its a good game with good mechanics True its glitchy and can bug out sometimeBut they ve really fixed this game upWould recommend
If it were single player with a story but same mapassests you d feel ripped off at 999 Its incredibly generic Net code is garbage sometimes you will miss every shot regardless Watch the kill cam and you get pretty anoyed pretty fast Ring of Elysium is a clone by the same devs free to play and it shows that there was definitly something wrong with PUBGs netcode For this reason alone i cannot recommend this game
in playerunknown battlegays you play as Seth Rogen in an ultimate survival test to be better than 100 hundred peoples
This game s really fun
After the last updatei cannot play it anymoreafter each one it becomes poorly optimised
Current state  Nope dont buy itWhen the game was released it was running pretty smooth and the gameplay experience was very goodThe more patches went live the more FPS u lost Sometimes the game stutters and feels really bad It went from a solid 70 90 fps to 40 60 fps with drops to 30 fps The desync got worther sometimes u are already behind a wall  like 1 second and u started to use some bandages but suddenly u get knocked out by the guy who previously was hunting you through the wall yes nice laggThere are still ini commands which can disable trees and stones in the distance  Bluehole give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about thatThey arent really interested in fixing the game The current main goal is to push the game on the xbox one and get more cash after that the project will probably die The Code of PUBG must be garbageMost of the objectives on the map are bought right out of the unreal engine store so they didnt do them on their ownThe amount of asian hackers on NA OC and EU is pretty insane the leaderboards are full with guys who have kill streaks of 50 people or more and nearly 100  winrate  BLUEHOLE dont delete those accounts Speedhackers are common too My last game was a good game until top 10 suddenly one guy went full rage mode and killed 8 other guys within 15 seconds    HEADSHOT only THAT cant be legit Maybe they will fix the problems but i dont think so Its a cash cow for a small korean company
Region lock China Seriously
All in all A very fun game Yes it has its issues server lag hackers poor optimisationn ect But for a game that has been adopted on this magnitude it should be expected that the developers will be perpetually behind on these issues Despite the issues patches are constantly pushed and the developers are responsive to issues Despite issues this game is ever challenging luck based and fun If you do well you can make money as well With the responsivness of the dev team this game can only improve
Can t recommend this game until it s optimized
Hackers took over the game along with Bluehole who simply doesnt careServers are unstable the least with only 17hz netcodepiece of crap
The game is great Lots of whiney LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE es reviewing this though
Kapan diskon 
a guy was running and i flick one  tapped him xD
Amazing game but i cant aim at all i got second place with 0 kills
The game is ok but i have had many bad experiences with it
Lags way too much
Youre going to need a lot more than the system requirements Even at ultra low settings the FPS drops to less than 10 if theres more than 1 player around you Not worth the money for a poor quality game Concept is good though but the delivery is weak
it s so bug you need 16 gb of ram to play it on low really  there is no game in this moment that need 16 gb  c mon and they put 6 gb of ram minimum they don t optimezi  for the amd ryzen  i want my money back  fortnite works 10x better than pubg  and he is better optimeze
I recommend this game   because of its idea and all the reasons why you ve played this gameBUTI don t recommend   because of its bad graphic optimizition and a weak Anti Cheat that let the cheaters and hackers win with   infinite ammo infinite durability of helmet and vests loot places aim hacks and wallhacks and but I still keep playing it because I love itDear Bluehole developers please try to fix these problems PUBG reviews were all very positive but now it s really badalso accept some UI designers they can help you  
Don t get me wrong this game is usually great funusuallyThere are major problems with this game that are holding it back and why games like Fortnite are more popular1 Servers and RegionsThe servers are a lottery sometimes you get a server that runs fantastically or you get a server that lags and prevents you from moving with  Network Lag Detected  The regions are also an issue if you want to play duos or squads with random people there is no regionlock2 OptimizationEven with every setting on very low screen res at 70 and all the launch commands you could possibly think of on a pc with I5 4430 and GTX 750 TI The game stutters constantly and the mouse input feels sloppy due to the frames3 DevelopmentThese devs are awful at making a fun game this is why Fortnite is becoming more popular because those devs know how to make a fun game Overall If you have a ridiculously good PC or don t care about low frames this game is amazing when it works when it doesn t work the game is the worst BR game out there PUBG doesn t hold a candle to Fortnite with simpler graphics that run well to a wider audience more fun features etc So in summary if the devs get their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  together and start making the game better this game would easily trump Fortnite or H1 or The Darwin Project but if the devs keep slacking the game will become stagnant and dead I mean for LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s sake we ve had 10 updates since 10 Are you LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing serious  Since Jan 1st Fortite has had like 20 updates No wonder so many people are abandoning ship
One of the greatest games I ve ever played It s intense and riveting Definitely recommend to those who love third and first person shooters
Very good game I play it everyday and I m not sure why it has so bad reviews but I d say this game is definitely worth your money
Awesome Game I love how you are always on your toes and never know if someone will be right behind that door to kill you
This game is popular becuase it has no real competition H1Z1 is even worse just want to say in my opinion Think about if you heard about a game that was in early access that had one map that wasn t even finished and had errors on it like jagged edges in random spots and fields The game had problems with hit detection and at the start of the game was so laggy to the point when you open a door it takes 3 seconds to open after you hit F When you shoot someone some times takes seconds after you shot them for them to go down Also have the game crash sometimes and for the lobby system to get messed up and to make it better to be honest seems like with every update it gets worse Then they say in December we will be leaving early access They also need to add optimizations to the game and fix the hacker problem So all this needs to be fixed before December They also say we will be working on the game after early access which I do think is true but to say a game is 10 and out of early access means you feel that game is good to ship today to a store and be 100  ready to play Like the old days when you bought a game and it was done no updates the game was just the way it is Even if all the things I said were fixed and they added vaulting and a new map is 2 maps one game mode and 21 main weapons  as of 91417 a full game  Then if yes get the game  By the way I play this game because I have not seen anything out there that grabs my attention fortnite is fun but not really into the art styleThis is the only choice so I play this
Yep
optimize plz
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  trash that doesn t even know how to fix the numerous party issues that there are
very nice 18hz tickrate 1010
good game but it would be much better if every person who bought the game recieved a free cheesy asiago flatbread from panera bread
The most recent update literally made this game unplayable for me Whenever I open the game it minimizes to my desktop I ve tried rebooting and using a different keyboard but nothing works Oh well
great game love it so addicting
Just an extra off button for my PC
Last night I played with some friends and met a squad of hacker that used speed hacks and aim bot s you couldn t poke your head out in the open without getting shot in the head from over 200 meters at the same time someone 300 metters away from you get hit in the head also
Hackers 110117 wait to buy this on xbox consoles leave very little opportunities for someone to hack if you want to buy this now on pc just be warned you wasted your money
It s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  lmao
always crash oftenso bad
all the negative reviews are farsical this game is the shizz are there problems  yes there are are they an issue  no not really there minor and i have full confidence and faith in pubg corp to fix them the game is a MUST BUY
Fix your servers
One of the few games that lots of people still play but is constantly being ruined by the developers and in my opinion is a complete garbage game that could ve been much more When it first came out was probably the best time to have played it the game was way more fun with what I think had fewer glitches than it does now Negatives Optimization is still terrible   I don t understand how it s still this bad for a game that s fully released and not early accessConstant crashes  Lots of people still crash either it s at the loading screen for a match or when you leave a matchTerrible servers  they can crash in the middle of a match so you just watch yourself die to the zoneupdates that only make the game worse  new errors worse optimization some how adding things that aren t neededDevelopers not listening to the community  not fixing issues and getting rid of weatherLots of hackersGood chunk of glitches  some are fun like how motorcycles can just launch all other vehiclesPros hmmmm   Honestly this game isn t worth playing anymore until they fix their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I would rather recommend Fortnite a free to play game to people who want to play Battle Royale I just can t understand how pubg is fully released but is just this piece of garbage Fortnite is better by a long shot and I don t even like Fortnite that s saying something Fortnite an early access game free to play is better than pubg a fully released 30 game
I really don t want to give this game a bad review as its given me hours of entertainment despite its glaring flaws but alas it suffers from having a god awful Dev team who cares more about lining then their own damned game While their out flinging lawsuites over the pettiest LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the game is not only being infested with hackers but a myrid of bugs  server issues and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  poor optimization that should of been fixed AGES ago But nooo they are too busy getting angry that other folk  stole their idea  when they weren t even the first to do this genre  It genuinely saddens me that such an amazing game is going to get drug to its death

i can t play the game i har the game but it won t load like it supposed to   would love to play the game
this game has the potential to be one of the best games I ve played BUT the amount of hackers within the game are completly ruining it
Lots of cheaters lag lag lotting for nothing and again the CHEATERS ruin this game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ers
I LIKE THIS GAME  
I reccommed
Nice Battle Roayl better than Fortnite and hizi this A VERY NICE GAME Buy  IT  and you can be surprised of that BUY IT

Test servers are far better than the actual servers imo I play test servers with average 45 frames whereas normal servers I only get 15 25yadda yadda LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  computer I know thisstill fun though mostly with friends
A  less than okay game glorified to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  almost solely due to their competitor s bad performance is finally falling from grace Another huge opportunity missed due to an incompetent management and PR team and subpar development and maintenance
Devs have alot of work to do in order to justify micros and base price for little content
  badly optimized  laggy  bad hitboxes  bad terrain character posing  can t lay on the ground on some rocksbad coding  it takes more than 3 shots from assault rifle to down a person  didn t expect that kind of sheet from ArmA dev  BUT u can be kille
Love this game awesome lots of fun
really good game Needs updates to fix bugs
game is realy good  GOD JOB 
Very challenging game for me and my pc  
nerfed pan
Almost every top 10 players are hackers Did blue hole done something 
Too many usersConnection failedU been killed by hackerU died from the red zone
Don t let all the recent reviews make you think the games is ruined or something It  only horrible if you are in asia otherwise it s still awesome
meh not much variety tbh
PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is a semi realistic battle royale game It has many unique and cool features such as weapon attachments bullet physics lots of guns dynamic circle etc It is a lot of fun with friends and can be fun in soloThe game does seem to have wierd hit registry  watched a sniper shot enter and go through a guys head with no blood or even hit however works fairly well most of the time It also suffers from poor optimization  while a lot better from launch it does still need improvingIf you enjoy semi realistic shooters like Arma or even came from H1Z1  KOTK I would highly recommend PUBG
Too many people are giving it negative reviews because of optimization issues Let me be real for a second   the game is technically still in  early access  so of course it s not going to be 100  stable They are working on itit just blew up as the  H1Z1  killer and people are expecting too much Instead of complaining help the team grow and the game will flurish into what you wantHere s my honest thought as the game sits today   it s easily the best battle royal game on the market Looking for a different styled FPS game this might be the one for you
Patch 10 Update  Game still suffers from a lot of the fundamental issues Lag isn t quite as bad as before however cheaters are still rampant Things like speadhacking and shooting through walls don t occur anymore however aimbots are still all too common especially among chinese players Not getting killed by cheaters is the exception not the norm Vaulting is a really nice addition  it opens up the game and makes it more dynamic The new desert map however is among my group of friends considered inferior to the new one Great idea but all the little issues make it frustrating to play The game is horribly optomized and network code is terrible At the beginning of each match it takes half a second to open a door or pick up an item The movement and shooting mechanics are clunky Hackers are rampant made possible since half the game mechanics are calculated client side  desync between client and server shooting through walls speedhacking etc Heck its possible to walk straight through a building if they haven t loaded in for the player Again the idea is great but the flawed execution by devs who either don t know what they re doing or don t care enough to do it correctly really cut into the enjoyment of the game
                     Special garbage game company for external be careless with anti BOT system update the morning only tens of minutes and the emergence of plug in garbage landfill
Buggiest most poorly optimized game ive ever played Constant frame drops delayed loading of the ENTIRE map and constant restarting just to get into a game Fix your s    bluehole
This game used to be fun but with the latest patch there has been a huge influx of hacking                                    In the last week I have had probably 10 12 instances of my entire squad getting headshot from 300 400m away by a single person with a Kar98k in only 4 bullets while we were running Thought it was a lucky play at first but when it happens in about 1 out of 3 games I get suspicious watching these people get 15 20 kills all headshots with sniper rifles and crossbowsMoving on we get fun things like our entire squad getting killed simultaneously inside different rooms of a building by one guy My personal favorite though is getting killed with an M16 while hiding in a room with no windows  lying prone in the showeI have really loved this game and enjoyed the past 400 hours or so since march but in it s current state it isn t any fun anymore It just isn t worth looting for 10 15 minutes and hiking across the map only to get murdered by people who want to ruin the game with cheats I would be willing to give 1010 if Bluehole can crack down on these issues but until then I highly do not recommend itUpdate  1 14 18The replay system has just confirmed my suspicions It seems more games than not involve being killed by people with obvious wallhacks and the ability to shoot through cover
It cures AIDS like never before
developer can t develop a proper game Pls I can develop better than them PLS IMPROVE THE DAMN GAME
It s very nice if you can control your rage sometimes
After hundreds of hours I can finally review this game with a full understanding of everything this game has to offer When I first picked up the game it consumed my life I spent countless full days playing this game non stop It was riddled with bugs crashes and endless FPS spikes but I stuck with it I kept telling myself  It s really early in development Things will improve  That was before the game had concurrent players into the millions After a bunch of tiny fixes that trickled out I fear that this game may not ever reach its true potential With so much hype and so much money pouring in you would think that the studio would have the money to hire decent game designers and engineers yet the game still runs like a raging fire of garbage I feel at this point the developers will likely move onto other projects and PUBG as we know it will die They ve made their money and there is no reason the make the game any better than it is as long as its profitable After playing AAA titles and feeling how good a game can be with a solid engine and actual effort put into making it it s hard to come back It makes me angry every time I play this game because I cannot perform even the most mundane of tasks such as  looting jumping and driving can turn into a frustating impossible taskGoodbye PUBG It was fun until it got old
Im potato users and its suck
Let me update the system requirements for you BlueBallsSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM OS  64 bit Windows 7 Windows 81 Windows 10Processor  Intel Core i5 7600KAMD Ryzen 7Memory  12 GB RAMGraphics  GTX 970  Radeon RX580DirectX  Version 11Network  Broadband Internet connectionStorage  30 GB available spaceThis is what your PC should look like if you wanna play this game on minimum Even then don t count on it since the devs don t know how to optimize a gameDON T BUY IT
Still no solo first person servers for OceaniaDespite this game making millions it still is a buggy mess
FIX THE GAME 
The game itself is good but servers are unstable client is buggy and optimization is lava to the developers Despite the  stream sniper  epidemic the community is rediculously overflown with campers especially in EU The majority of other servers especially NA are at least man enough to fight not to hide like a bunch of pansies PS I don t give two LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  about your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t opinion on my review so don t bother This is my experience with this game and it s my subjective experience on the game I might recommend this game after its release but at this stage it s a certain no
the company made tons of moneythe game is still is unstable
I have not played any battle royal games before PUBG since I didn t think it would interest me that much But the publicity PUBG got brought it to my attention because the focus of the game is your personal experience Every game is unique No matter your playstyle you will find enjoyment playing You can be stealthy or go berserker and fight everyone you see What matters is that you can do what you want What I hope is that when the game leaves early access it will be optimized cause you need a moster pc rig to enjoy it to the fullest now Other than that this is probably the game of the year considering the value for money it offers since you will be playing it for years
Very unoptimized game however the gun mechanics and overall gameplay is amazingWould really appreciate for the devs to improve performance i m on integrated graphics    so i cant play
servers are down as soon as 10 comes out
We go with sneaky peeky leg
Game is an abhorrent trashcan of dismay
too much hackers
so many hackers and bugs Atleast every other game for me Hoping they get everything fixed before the release
 ESports ready Since the devs want everyone to play it currently I wish they would make it more playable instead of filled with issues that probably won t ever be fixed  cough network lag detected and poor optimisation which should really be a priority from the startIs it fun Yes when you actually get a match where you are lucky enough to get good loot a good zone and don t bug out when you landGood gameplay poor game
Great Game But i hope the game become fully optimized
It s fun Both playing alone and with friends there are things that they can improve but that comes with time It seems that the people not having fun just have a stick up their LOVE LOVE LOVE  cause they enjoy being LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s Don t be an LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and you will enjoy this game
Hackers every other game Bluehole has yet to do anything about it
everybody who says tis game has bad servers just has bad internet
If PUBG were going to  get gud  it would have happened allready the improvements being implemented in this game are small and soon it will be miles behind the next  game of the year PUBG is better optimised than it is made out to be however it featues  Some of the worst map design not being realistic or good for gameplay I have ever seen in a popular game it feels like somone played SIMCITY with some random assets Netcode is pretty Meh Vechicles drive TERRIBLY BUG AND GLITCHES ARE EVERYWHERE Hacking is semi Rampant each game has 100 players so it only takes a few hackers to ruin it Graphics Clarity and ease of use it also pretty mehA lot of the smaller things would beforgivable for smaller game studios however Blue Hole is a muilti billion dollar company and the game still feels like it made by 5 dudes and a asset store When compared to Battlefield 1 far from a perfect game PUBG falls flat in graphics gunplay map design ect  While I am glad it is somone new rather than EA or Ubisfot getting rich better to have 100 rich LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s than 5 This game is almost like a ponzi scheme that is going to crash soon the stupid lawssuit agianst the makers of Fortnight is a great sign of desperation for more moneyIn my opinion PUBG is a 610 game that has no place being one of the most played in the world
God game GG D
on9 get many item and die
This game and it s devs treat everyday customer as secondary customer and streamers as their marketing team too me I personally don t like micro transactions and the gambling or paid to win system that follows this game is on early access an yet bluehole is looking to make a quick buck out of the ignorant sheeps out there this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ends now
The experience of this game is very poor The first server often crashes leaving you out after more than 10 minutes of searching for weapons and it takes a long time to reconnect Second game optimization is very poor the game on the way often crashes connected to the game again has been out of the rhythm of the game  Thirdly there are many players using the external hang and the authorities are not able to stop it Spend a lot of money to configure the computer spend money to buy the game but because of the ability of the game developers but let the user experience extremely poor this company is very bad

go to hell mom im not going to school u cun tt

Id rather buy Winrar
H1Z1 is better
Servere are to Bad lagging and sometimes roll back The devloper just want to make money with WTF cest But the game is still fun and enjoyable play with your squad and kill or being killed to get shome CHICK
If you like being cucked by hackers then buy this game
its alright FOR ME POOP ON
h1 is a better game
Make sure you can run it but It s worth the money and I d buy it over again Believable bullet physics and gunplay Decent momentum system on foot  so people don t spazzily zig zag Variety of weapons and optics Enough variety in the map to have many different firefight scenariosAnd most importantlyHard working devs that release frequent updates content and newsPeople complain too much about PUBs even when it is this far ahead of the competition This has a great balance between hardcore realism and quickcasual playability It s also easy to apply real life logic to in game strategy and get a good result which is convenient when having a tense firefight The best part for me by far is finding an effective workaround to the tense situations that the RNG puts me in Getting caught between the zone and another squad sucks but thinking quick and getting yourself out of it is one hell of a good feeling Its fun in it s current state but it still has a long way to go Regardless PUBs is a good game for the price and it is replayable as hellKeep up the good work guys

amazing game although a bit boring when you have no friends   also some glitches the developers could work on
THIS GAME HAS MORE CHEATS IN IT THEN THE AUSSIE CRICKET TEAM
The game is absolute trash made by complete idiots   korean monkeys Let s skip this part since all of you already know that all the koreans just garbage and this garbage unable to do something reasonableLet s talk about china China   is the trash can that houses worst biomaterials of humanity China is the place where lives most stupid and worst people of planet Earth From the very begining china was just cheap labour for all the rest of humanity but something went wrong and these monkeys were allowed to use computer Especially to play games But as you may already know chinese garbage is brainless and thus unable to play competetive and fair So they use cheats to show that they worth at least something But it isn t so And it came to this moment to PUBG to game that was made by another asian junk So while people form EuropeAmerica try to get some rest to play few games with their mates they always run into stupid asian trash that uses cheats just because he or she is too silly to not useI wish one fggt named brandon green one day enabled region lock in PUBG so good people would be able to play without asian monkeys but this isn t the case for him right know since he cares about money only Until then I m going to play this so called game a little bit more and will be updating this review with the list of stupid garbage that uses cheatsThe list starts here http steamcommunitycomprofiles76561198449664508  noob with WHhttps pubgmeplayerszeret1ekxs  absolute crap with all in one hackhttp steamcommunitycomprofiles76561198418838560  stupid WHhttp steamcommunitycomprofiles76561198040550755  stupid russian trash with whhttps pubgmeplayerzx329958  complete chinese trash with whhttps pubgmeplayeryouxiang9  stupid chinese monkey with wh and aimhttps pubgmeplayerwolf  kiss  wh noobhttp steamcommunitycomprofiles76561198352643228  china trash with whhttps steamcommunitycomidDennisYoung  russian LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  kid with whhttp steamcommunitycomprofiles76561198386806166  whhttp steamcommunitycomprofiles76561198439619289  chinese moneky wh
awsome gam
Good game Some stuff is a little quirky but that is expected from an early access game I like how that game is has a different feel from every time
I really loved this game but lately the hackers have been ruining it When someone can snipe you inside of a room with now windows whilst also sniping 4 at people all over the map at the exact same time it gets a little difficult to have fun Sadly this has been happening quite often lately The game has been compromised Seems like the devs have some work to do Do not buy until updates have addressed this Sorry PUBG
So I got an hour straight of playing PUBG and I came to this conclusion Do not get this game if you don t have any friends If you play alone all you will do is run around from town to town gathering gear only to bleed out when someone gets a lucky shot 1 kilometer away The fun comes from playing with friends which kind of ruins the whole  player unknown  part of the game So do I recommend this game  Ehhhh yeah But only so you can beg your friends to get it too in hopes you play with them But if you re a loner boner have fun bleeding out in a wheat field
This game is completely ruined thanks to Korean Japanese and Chinese players FLOODING the North American servers Hackers come along with them game is poop dont buy its dead1162018 UPDATE  I was hoping this game would have some sort of region lock or ping cap enacted but so far there s nothing Still losing over half of my games to extreme desync or hackers At least the new replay feature helps me confirm that Still nothing done to fix this growing problem Bad news for PUBG
Love this game It has its issues and it gets frustrating But i always come back to it
Amazing game 10 our of 10
Great design concept poor execution The game is fun to play casually but if you re competitive or you care about your ranking it s borderline unplayable Parachutes get stuck for 10 seconds on nearby buildingsobjects and cutting it doesn t help you land any faster Some players will arbitrarily have landing lag while others can run full sprint upon landing Some items need to be grabbed 3 4 times before they are picked up People will queue cross server games with 150 ping and teleport around corners There s a degree of RNG if you land near other players due to the nature of item spawns Car physics are questionable If Bluehole Studios allocated even 1  of that 300 million toward better engineers the game would be leaps and bounds ahead of its current state As it stands the game will continue bleeding players to other titles and for good reason
Optimization really really really needs work If I can handle The Witcher 3 on Ultra Settings on 1440P then I should handle this game easily in 1080p Servers definitally needs maitnence And the report system is broken
Alright so I have mostly played in duo s and everytime I have it has been full of buggyness and poor perfomance Some of the physics in it are just totally F   ed up I would much rather play Arma 3 Battle Royal than this  game 
They created a new type of Game So lets just call it Microsoft Then some other people came along and made a better game in almost every way and had a better buisness model Lets call them Apple Now Microsoft is suing Apple Completition is supposed to make both games better but instead one is just throwing in the towel and waiting til something the new game makes is sorta not really like the thing in Microsoft then they claim it s theirs They could make the game non glitchy release a free version or maybe create servers that don t have a minute wait time because no one likes to wait your morons 60 seconds   The thing that will take most away from society is suing them They did it better than you the fact they feel like they own 100 player games just because they got to them first and threaten to sue anyone who comes near it really puts into perspective how Blue Hole operates They re creative for a little bit then they play Kind of the Hill010   Horrible company out dated and glitchy game
The game is a fun shooter With almost 500 Hours on it I ve played a metric ton of games with my buddies and Iin general used to enjoy it a lot UnfortunatelyThe game is plagued with a lot of glitches at the moment and most prevalent hackers There s been a huge increase in hackers as many players will see from the leaderboards and the  Report  Button seems to do nothing about these people who don t even attempt to generally hide the fact they are cheating in the game Paired with the fact you can t shoot through window bars it can make for an obnoxious enviroment Until the game deals with the cheatershackers I wouldn t reccomend playing it considering every two three games you get one of themGood luckUPDATE This game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Stupid chinese ruined this entire game Maybe if chinese people knew how to play games instead of cheat in them this game would still be enjoyable
fix this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
oof hacker m9 get this game if you wanna waster 30 oof
Since release this game has just getting worse and worse With all that money they have they should be able to develope this game with ease but somehow it just keeps getting worse with every patch fog maps  rain maps  they just keep adding LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  nobody wants and passes it off as  progress  These devs are garbage
I absolutely love the game 1010 would buy the game Definitely worth the cost
Absolutely love this game The only complaint I have is the vehicle physics  especially the bike with the side cart
Garbage game sold so many copies in china do not want to optimize the server but to earn money to promote third party accelerator Ubisoft although the server is also garbage but it is also trying to optimize this is gap between the game manufacturers and small workshop  I v see morepoor server games like this  but like this is not ashamed of it but   relying on the tattered server to make money you blue hole may be the first one I can fxxk off it your mother even Tencent is not as good as The first bad comments  at steam
YOU LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  NEED TO SORT THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SERVERS OUT THE AMOUNT OF CHCIKEN DINNERS I VE LOST BECAUSE OF GAME CRASHING IS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
nice servers LUL
esport ready btw
Still need more optimization But great game
The game has a lot of lag and bug
Optimize the game and make it playable removing bugs it is bearly playable right now and its blowing with the number of players  just imagine if it s optimized and bughack free
Good gameRounds are not over lengthycontrols are easy to manage
They put ads in the gameAdsThis is unacceptable
CHEATING
CRASHES IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME FIX THIS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game and everyone in it Except for BoBJoNeZ He s great
there are too much waigua
This game is AWESOME if you LOVE CHEATERS and CRASHES   NOTHING like your team getting killed with 4 consecutive headshots and guys with 400 to 1 KD ratios  It s like they are not even trying  This game won t last through the year   I wish I had my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing 30 back
Pos game
I honestly do not know why there are so many negative reviews most of them are probably people who are mad since they got banned for teamkilling This game is not as glitchy as you might think sure it s an early access game but it runs pretty well nowThe only REAL problem with this game is the price
Bluehole won t make their servers failsafe As their hackers get banned and they have to buy another account which in turns makes them more money The reason why A littlebird told me that because Bluehole employees have a mole hence on day 1 after they release their anti cheat patch GUESS WHAT   Hackers already
i LOVE IT  
U GOT LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BAN THOSE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HACKERS THEIR BULLETS CAN GO THROUGH THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING WALL
   8G
Too steep of a learning curve for me I guess  Maybe my reaction time is just too slow  To me this game is more stressful than fun
they said they just updated anti cheat but i still met the cheater
The game doesn t let me play it on my brand new pc because it crashes
FIRSTLY I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW BASED ON THE GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE THE GAME IS AMAZING ATHOUGH FRUSTRATING AT TIMES AND HAS THE TRUE POENTIAL TO BE A 1010 FPSHOWEVER CURRENT ISSUES   SPEED HACKERS AIMBOT HACKERS SPEED SHOT HACKERS BLUE ZONE DAMAGE INCREASED SILENT VEHICLE KILLS  NOW THE HACKERS ARE UNAVOIDABLE IN FPS SHOOTERS DUE TO THE IMPLIMENTATION OF CRATES AND THE DEVS BOAST ABOUT ANTI CHEATHOWEVER I AM YET TO SEE PERMINANT BANS FOR PEOPLE USING HACKS    BLUE ZONE DAMAGE INCREASEDTHIS IS A JOKE THE CIRCLE FORCES PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER TO ENGAGE IN A FIGHT NOW YOU ARE HAVING MORE PEOPLE DIE TO THE ZONE THAN EVER   FIX THIS   FASTER ZONE MOVEMENT LESS DAMAGE OR SLOWER MOVEMENT AND MORE DAMAGE EITHER WAY ALLOW THOSE POPLE WITHOUT A VEHICLE TO FIGHTI WOULD NOT RECOMMENT BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES LISTED
Cheaters Cheaters everywhere Find a way to get rid of them Bluehole
the game was good before they added the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  desert map  fully released  the game in a broken state and let chinese hackers play on OC servers
PUBG  More like NETWORK LAG DETECTED Simulator
Ignoring the laissez faire attitude towards hackers and the numerous glitches  my favorite being I try and shoot someone but when I press the trigger nothing happens later in kill cam my gun went off after I was dead my body was being lootedThere is one thing I m going to ding this game on  reward crates are just a cover for more micro transactions  You use rewards that you earn in game to buy a crate and you have what seems like a 35 chance to get a crate that requires a key to open  You have to use real money to buy the key  Wasn t always like this but now I have to spend more money to unlock an item  I like your business practices devs  Release an unfinished game and only push updates to micro transactions  Good luck getting anymore of my money because I m not going for it
Very fun game with a good conceptOnly major issues are some lag and that textures always take ages to render at the start of games which is VERY annoyingMost of these negative reviews are talking about getting banned for killing streamers and the dreaded  stream honking  however this really isn t a major issue and it is mostly sensationalist trashGood Game
So like when I m playing the game it starts off normal and then this big blue wall comes at me and then I keep taking damage and I dont know what to do I think its a malware virus Game is unplayable
I watched at least 20 hours of YouTube videos on this game before I finally purchased it  WHAT AN AMAZING GAME Such an amazing concept  Beautiful graphics I m just getting back into gaming after being on and off for 22 years  I ve was a audio engineer for the last 2 decades  leaving me little to no free time  But now all my free time is going back into gaming and I ll tell you  what a wonderful way to pick back up  with this game I highly recommend it
Arma  BR  PUBG
Game was fun but it s become clear that the developers have given up because they don t need to care So many people have bought the game so they have no incentive to fix it s longstanding problems and they just blatantly allow bots cheaters and refuse to fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  netcode Save your money and spend it on something that s worth it   don t waste it on this garbage
veri gut gemi recoment710
Cant recommend this game performance is really bad   
This is my go to game at the moment It is a lot of fun to hop on with some friend it is a challenge but that is what makes me keep coming backWhen you find yourself on the waiting Island it is great fun to run around yelling CHINA NUMBER 1 and being a snek in grass If you get tired of that hop around and play music throught you mic start a party The last thing you can do is be an LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and run around shooting people like a nob It is great fun
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME TOO MANY HACKERS
Other users are using a lot of cheatunoffical program or software to enhance their game experienceThis is making it difficult for current players to enjoy the game and eventually users will stop playing Can this be controled by your company 
Hackers hackers everywhere Way to make millions off a game just to screw people over Might as well take your money and put it right in the toilet There are a few more than 6k a day  hacking  This is way out of control and is only getting worse Instead of focusing on fixes that allow players to ya know play they focus of additions that are convenient yet not vital  vaultingclimbingblue zone damagefog instead of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HAXORZ THAT RUIN THE GAME AND KILL PLAYER BASE Pretty sorry state for a game to be in if they are already charging money Bad news for gamers everywhere
Fix the rampant hacking and I would be more than happy to recommend this game
no other game makes your heart beat as fast as this one will when you win a chicken dinner
Newest update fixes a lot of issues Runs smoother and the new map is awesome
It doesnt help when almost every game you play is full of hackers that can head shot you from across the map The devs say the are banning them but they are coming in just as fast as they are going Find a new way to stop these hackers for good
Fix your broken LOVE LOVE LOVE  game Hackers fill every lobby You can no longer have a game without being killed by some speed wall or aim hacking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that have nothing better to do then wreck others enjoyment Battleye needs to get there business in order and ban them all IP or MAC banning is the only thing that will stop all these kiddes wrecking it for us legit players
just unfun for me
why you delete my win in pubg
game of the year
Best 30 Ive spent on a game
Nice Game xD
Fun to drop in get a few kills then die XDBut really this game is one of the best games I ve played this yearSadly you need a pretty high end PC to run it well but that might change over timeGreat game I would definitely recommend it It s fun to play with friends or just by yourself
 i     
Pretty great game I love it
Good game enough said xD
Hope to do better Guarantee fairness Not bought by Tencent It s hot now I hope it will optimize and improve Don t get a little hot after a while
eh it s fun buy with friends
The game was fun at first but then I noticed how bad the EU servers are compared to NA servers Looting and openingclosing doors is sometimes almost impossible But the main issue AT THE MOMENT is the goddamn speedhackers They are everywhere almost in every game and they just wipe out everyone Squad by squadStopped playing this game and maybe I ll return to it when developer does something to these new cheatscheatersAt the moment I can t recommend this gameEDIT  There seem to be less cheaters nowadays so I think developers are doing something to the problem But lag on EU servers is just getting worse and worse as they are almost unplayable
Nice game but it s still on early acces hope to fix the buggs sometime
BROKEN please fix LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s you up at the wors possible times
IF you like getting all your loot and then get killed by a hacker you will love this game
way cant i play the game i cantpress play i want my money back
Parachute in Collect random selection of armor weapons and various boosty items Run outside Kill guy in neighboring house Bam got me a slightly used x4 scope Run another 28 minutes excited to lay some hate in unsuspecting fools Get shot in the dome headshot by some guy in his underwear with a M16This is seriously like 35 matches you play So why would I recommend this game  I ll tell you The game is exciting in ways most games miss the mark on It can also be incredibly difficult Chances are you already know how this game is played It s a simple concept that is complimented by being able to get killed in a match and jump right back into another You WILL end up running miles and miles sometimes for nothing Other games you will land with a dozen others and somehow walk away unscathed with a few kills under your belt It s a bit of a pain though You could end up with great gear or pretty much nothing The game is not made for sitting down and having a relaxing experience It s meant to get you all hopped up on adrenaline screaming at some guy named MrMidgetLover after he headshots youI have seen quite a few comments just blasting this game Game is clunky Servers are trash Menu has issues Something something a streamer got me banned If you let any of those comments actually deter you from experiencing this game you failed yourself This game was released into ALPHA in March Seven months later it s come plowing through hearts and minds like 30 06 This was entirely unexpected it hit a niche like few other games have achieved So let me clear this up The game is clunky yes and entirely playable It hasn t reached that stage in it s life to get that added polish we all love in modern games Never once did I lie awake at night thinking about how unsettlingly clunky this game is Servers are trash  I am pretty sure Bluehole wasn t entirely ready for 10 million copies before it turned a year old They have been doing a pretty good job at adding servers and addressing these issues I ve had a few problems with the Menu it happens It was also immediately fixed by clicking the conviently place refresh UI button I m not even sure how this is a valid reason to not recommend the game I mean seriously Their autoban system is in overdrive right now banning thousands of people daily They have also had a few situations involving streamers and getting banned This stuff is going to pop up doesn t matter the game There will be kinks like this This game is in it s adolescence there is still a lot to work out I trust that by the time this game is fully released that there will be a functioning system in place to deal with these issuesSo if you are thinking about playing this game there are a few things to keep in mind  It is in no way optimised If you are anywhere near those specs they list as  Recommended  you may want to upgrade first or wait on better optimisation You Will Die Over and over again Git gudThis game is in ALPHA I feel like half of these reviews that don t recommend this game are completely unwarranted at this point in time If this game was fully released and launched it d be a different story You will encounter bugs The servers are going to go down Some dude using an aimbot is going to kill you Such is life for a game seven months old Roll with the punches and have fun with it
nice game lolzshoutouts an thomas
Nice game with some issuesHope they fix it fast
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Gameplay not that good graphics Bad community this doesnt worth 30
This game made me a non vegan 1110 chicken dinners
A wonderful game  that creates thrill over the typical FPS games  It resembles the characteristics  of The Hunger Games and  even with a similarity it s  really one heck of a gameplay
Great game and I expect it will only improve from here on out Definitely worth the money
At this moment unplayable due to the extreme increase in hackers implement a region lock or this game will lose playersIve never in my whole gaming life seen the extreme numbers in hackers 322000 players banned atm
PUBG is a really good game but they LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up the servers
1 Very clunky movement inventory management and vehicle handling2 Problems with hit registration3 Graphically unimpressive especially when rendering large distances4 Loot boxes as a way to milk money out of a title that hasn t even been released yet is a really bad move5 This is a matter of taste but I personally feel the game is a bit too fast paced what with the  kind of ridiculous shrinking zone pushing players towards each other At the later stages of the game there is very little room for tactical manouvres I prefer the pace of Arma s Wasteland game modes when it comes to battle royale Your mileage may vary though Overall the game feels really clunky in a way that I don t think is going to be adressed in the future While Arma 3 is equally clunky when it comes to inventory management and character movement it at least looks decent and has a more slow paced gameplay which I personally prefer PUBG is being praised like the second coming of Christ and I just want to point out that this game has a looot of issues  Fun with friends  is hardly an argument to be taken seriously as I could play even the stupidest of games with friends and it would still be fun  because you know you re socializing with people you like310 the fact that this is being made by a no name korean studio and not a more established developer is really showing in some placesPS  Not included in the review are complaints about bugs  expected for an early access title or developers catering to streamers  don t give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  The problem with this game is that it s coded and distributed like a shovelware title nothing more nothing less
Don t buy the game it is bug filled and the game runs as good as a horse with no legs
I can see that alot of people are beginning to hate on this game It s not perfect but honestly the games querkiness makes it more enjoyable Ive put in a little under 200 hrs and gameplay is always funthey added new weapons and increased the optimization of the game since i first got it Don t be reppelled by the negative commentstry it yourself and you will love the game People only say bad things because they are salty
Would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the thrill of shooting and getting shot at   or panned for that matter and I mean who wouldn t like some chicken for dinner   
Was waiting for a game like this to coming along ever since the mess of DayZ The game mostly delivers on what it promises provided you have an at least mid range gaming PC As usual this is an Early Access title  although they claim they are releasing in 10 weeks from now so there is a lot to address bug wise performance wise and also feature wiseThe core game is great Most of the negative reviews are from people with sub par gaming rigsdon t understand what Early Access means Of course there are other issues like hackers  haven t seen any in my 320 hours at time of review annoying bugs and a China region specific Ad related issue  at time of reviewGood bits  Fantastic range of weapons which are mostly balanced and all have their uses Core mechanics work well with major potential for improvementother modes   features Development team have released a lot of updates Every game is different Real world military tactics work well You can play in your own preferred way  going for killswinsfunsneaky etc The rush of getting high tier loot from a drop Bad bits  While they have optimised the game significantly since EA release the game is still very unoptimised Sometimes you get killed because of bugsglitchesmajor sudden FPS drop No Region lock Main Menu UI is a tragedy Pre game lobby is a mess Audio has been in need of work for months  levelsclean upimprovementdirection
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTILL THEY PUT A  ANTI CHEAT  SYSTEMI dont know how hard it is to get a anti cheat system but banning cheaters account is USELESSYou know how much does a cheat cost  25 USD PER DAY Those damn cheater would care to buy another copy of a 30USD game Maybe this is the reason BLUEHOLE does not ban the IP address They probably counting on those cheater to buy more copys Who gives a S about our normal player we cant refund the game now anywayGame is fun play with friends is super fun but when your team got smasded by the cheaters inside the final circle after 20 mins of intense game play there is no fun
This game is seriously a ton of fun I love the intensity of the firefights  the slow build up plus no respawns makes each encounter feel especially visceral The large map allows for tactics to win the day and I suggest playing with friends for that extra layer of strategic teamplay The game is in early access but I ve already had more fun with it than some fully launched AAA titles I ve played It s only getting better Recommended
Despite the bugs it is a very addictive game that gets me playing over and over again def recommend
pubg is a great ideagenre on paper developed and executed horribly by some amateur korean team you can immediately tell how unpolished the game is in few minutes of gameplay while I prefer the realism in games like pubgarma over the cartoonish tactical aspect of Fortnite Fortnite runs much better and smoother than any other battle royale game out there especially pubg and they both use the same engine but I guess Epic Games were able to tweak and optimize their original unreal engine and did a hell of a good job compared to BlueholeStill can t believe that they ve made millions from this mess
A fun game which leaves you pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing anxious most of the time albeit it s quite niceStill has some optimalization problems and a bunch of cheaters here and there so be careful
In the top of the list of chefs are always on the list never been banned in the last month of a hundred games in the game more than 30 percent of the game appears plug in and can not detect the running speed exception As well as the use of plug in design speed anomalies perspective game client exception which is the game developers for the plug in connivance and even doubt it is the game developers leaked the game source code to participate in the plug of the interests of sharinguser game experience poor
This game is pretty good I love it
Awesome game addicted
doesnt let me play
A super fun shooter that has exploded into the communinty Would reccommend
This game has consumed my life
Very enjoyable Huge Player baseA few bugs but considering early access it s very well developedVery good game
One of the best multiplayer games i ever playedI played Halo Wolfenstein ET Quake Wars Call of duty and so onBut this is teamwork in small groups2 vs 98 or 3 vs 97 or 4 vs 96You relay on the information ammo guns health given by your ladscommunication is crusialCan t wait for the updates to come With more maps this game will be the best one ever
THE GAME IS QUITE TERRIBLEIT IS POPULAR JUST DUE TO SEVERAL FAMOUS CREATURES I HATE IT BECAUSE MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE PLAYING IT AND ALWAYS INVITE ME TO JOIN THEM I THINK IT BEHAVES LIKE TENCENT GAME
Loved watching Bluehole slowly deteriorate into a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  dev team
16 fps btw hehexd
At first I was REALLY into this game Its has some an interesting concept and some cool ideas It was great to have a multiplayer game that was just fun and not so serious  like CS GO BUT once the novelty wears off frustration quickly sets in and you realize why  this game just has too many issues to be enjoyed long term This was my first and last early access game NEVER AGAIN Because even the best of the best of early access just has too many issues for me to be bothered Now that the developer has already made its money why should they keep spending money to fix the problems  Nothing has improved since I bought the game 3 months ago Here s my list of issues CONS  The aiming mechanics are just plain bad and inconsistent Why in the devils LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  do I have to doubleclick to zoom  grenade physics are inconsistent too sometimes they just fell in place off the wall and sometimes they ricochet HACKERS The best I scored previously was 4th place The best I ve scored in the last 3 days  25th  Servers are inconsistently laggy And sometimes it put me in an Asian server even when I had NA checked PC optimization is pretty poor I have to set it down to low settings just to barely reach a stable 30 FPS I can play much more demanding games on medium at a stable 45 FPS no killcam The environment is really big Might as well have been struck by lightning the loot should be spread around a bit more evenly some buildings have nothing and some have an entire loadout  the game is too dependant on luck lots of running around and then you see one guy and you both try to shoot and throw nades until God farts and someone dies sometimes the game wont let me use med kits even though they are in my inventory VERY FRUSTRATINGIn its current state the game is broken Now that it is such an early access hit I highly doubt they will fix it because NOTHING has been improved in the 3 months I ve owned it Deleting from my hard drive now
Goes into first match into an American serverHears a bunch of Chinese peopleasks  Wait is this a Chinese server  hears from 10 people chasing him  CHINAH NUMBAH 1 1010 would get yelled at by Chinese people again

With all the controversy surronding this game its fair to say that if you buy it you know what you re getting into And i love this game but there is also a little stinge of hate i have for it either way its pretty amazing
Great game especially if you have friends It s a very steep learning curve but you ll get some wins eventually I ve put in hundreds of hours in this game and I would like to put in many more but I find myself going from playing a few hours daily to maybe one or two nights a week Why  CheatersCheaters are running rampant all over this game and the developer is not doing anything proactive about it They are very slow to ban even the most blatant cheaters People are speed hacking to run faster than any vehicle can move in the game shooting through walls headshots from a few kilometers away and even making guns shoot faster than possible It s completely ruined the experience for me and many others I ve checked profiles of cheaters days and even weeks after I first noticed them and they are still active with 90  headshots and averaging 30 kills per round   100 people total are in a single roundThey boast about banning thousands of cheaters each day but thousands more just show up as they buy new accounts and give the developer more money There is no reason for them to try and stop these people on a more permanent basis because they are profiting hugely off of their cheating It s quickly ruining this gameDo yourself a favor and don t buy this game as your experience will inevitably be ruined by cheaters winning game after game and wasting your time
In PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS you the player fight amongst others on an island with various  loot  ie guns melee weapons vests clothing materials for shielding and set out on a journey to be the last player alive If you win IF you win you ll get a Winner Winner Chicken Dinner As each minute passes a electric field surrounds the map forcing you further into the battlefieldYou can play with a mate or squad up with a team of four to take on the foes on the battlefield I ve sank 30 hours in and I m a fan It took me about 10 hours to learn the proper playstyle the location names etc In it s current state this is a super polished and great title to kick back and play HOWEVER the optimization is horendous My computer is FAR from  high end  but I can play any title that released in 2017 at max settings 1080p And with this I struggle to get 70 80 frames  with constant frame drops at absolute lowest settings I have a GTX 1060 6 GB   8 GB of DDR4 Memory   250 Evo SSD   i5 6400I ve found that if this is installed on a mechanical drive on occasion the map will not load in correctly As such the buildings have  potatoe graphics  or simply won t load in at all What I suggest  Buy now play for 2 hours  with in 14 days and if you don t like it just request a refund through the Steam support page
Boring game and Bluehole are a company with terrible business practises
I like to shoot people   
Very good game play a lot with friends
Bad framerate on good PCs weird bugs like clipping into doors or cars exploding when you hit a quarter foot bump in the road zips when you hit other vehicles melted buildings when they re too far out people playing out of their region and lagging around awful desynctick rate  dying when you re soundly around a wall for instanceand of course why I m actually posting this review  The hackersThe entire leaderboard is stacked with hackers and there is an ESPaimbotter or a speedhacker something like one in three games It s admittedly gotten a lot worse recently and I m hoping the devs fix it but with the game  ready  to go to full release at the end of the year riddled with bugs and cheaters I can t honestly recommend the gameEdit  Despite supposed anti cheat patches for the last few weeks it s still just as bad as everAnother Edit  Full release still just as bad as ever and the dev is suing everyone who makes games for a genre they stole from a book Dev also lied about paid loot crates and made them progressively more scummy by forcing you to get them instead of free to open ones at a random chance
Glitchy Makes no sense 0 Machanics trash players horrible but Wonderful
This game is lit but I suck at it   
This is the best game I have ever played It has good replay value and controlled randomness All those negative reviews you see are people who either play it for 10 hours and didn t bother to learn how to play or people who play for 200 hours and can t win every five rounds so they don t like it they re only here to win You will not win a lot of games I have had only 2 wins with 200 hours and one of them was because a bug pushed me under the map Not to mention that some funny bugs happen at this point and they re good fun to witness But this game has far to go 1010
The gameplay itself is amazing What ruins the game is the vast quantity of asian players who queue up for the north american server to intentionally teamkill you and ruin your experience There seems to be no protocols in place to prevent this just a report option at then end
h1z1Plug in is too serious now not severe blow can only follow the footsteps of h1z1 every game will encounter plug in there will be a game experience is particularly bad
Even after the full release the game is still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Laggy servers and horrible netcode make this a very horrible experience
So you would think with all the millions of dollars they have made off this game hosting their own tournament where people complained about the bugs at the tournament and the large playerbase they would have somewhat decent stability  Thats not this game Say what you want about Fortnite s Battle Royale but at least it s stable and doesnt crash everytime you load into a game or any time an explosion happens This is one of the laziest devlopment teams I ve ever seen considering the previous factors Sure they seemed loyal and dedicated at the start but now they are on the same level as EA maybe even worse cause their servers at least got stable after release
Literally one of the worst developer teams in the history of video games Littered with bugs and trash interactions They believe that streamers make the game and ban anyone who a streamer claims is a  streamsniper  without a second thought whilst forgetting that the very people they ban are the reason this trash excuse of a video game has any player base whatsoever Telling your community you wont make microtransactions available then immediately going back on your word then trying to port your non optimized game to console and have a 350k tournament before the game comes out of EarlyAccess is by far the most scummy thing ive ever heard of in video game history By the end of the year BlueHole will have taken the money and run before their heaping pile of broken trash completely dies out
Best game in my life no joke and  xdd
the game is really fun bit silly at time a bit stupid at time but overall i enjoy playing it and highly recommend it i would give it 9299
its kinda terrible
Ok so as an H1Z1 player i have to say that THIS GAME IS WAY BETTERFirstly the game is more casual and feels easyeryou often know where you get shot from most of the fights are close mid range loot is in more levels there are 3 types of helmet backpack and body armour also a ton more weaponsThe graphics are way better  running it on ultra with no problemsAlso the game has a lot of grass so you can hide pretty much everywhere and if you are in a open field getting shot at you have a chance talking about chances sometimes you don t die but get knocked out when you are knocked out you cannot fight and you have to go to cover and wait for your teammates to revive youThe weapons have attachments you cant just get out of the car when it s going at 100 miles per hour and you take damage from crashesOverall the games feels looks and plays much better than H1Z1Anyway the game is more expensive and the parachute is extremely wierd I am not saying that H1Z1 is a bad gameNot at allIt s a great game i love playing with my friends but i find PUBG better
Realy enjoyable game seriously its realy fun to those who like fps battle royals Its on of those games that you either like it or hate it and i personaly love it 3
it s an early access game so the game still have problem with servers and in game bugs give it a time and buy it if you want it now GO BUY IT NOW GAME OF THE YEAR TRUST ME LOVE THIS GAME
Has one of the worst optimization problems ever too little content many many uncountable bugs and the obligation to play on low graphics because of in game sight advantage   optimization problem still persists in the lowest settings even in high end computers aswell even though it is released 7 months ago This early access LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  has gone too far we are buying incomplete games that ll never get completed in 4 years because of popular culture hype and false coordination in community Don t even buy this game and go play H1Z1 It is way better
Great game stick at it it gets better
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE inf cheaters
I used to love this game But the fact that Bluehole and PUBGC Corp are so petty and jealous that I would personally say that we should boycott this game If anyone from the litigation team of Bluehole or PUBG Corp is reading this Youre actions show you to be what you are  A petty greedy disgusting company that is trying to shut down a patently better game that has completely blown you out of the water Drop the suit Stop being a disgusting company and allow gaming to be the wonderful market it is
literal LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  play fortnite
Excellent game
Look at all the bad reviews this game still feels like its in beta Bugs lags crashes hackers horrible gun play and mechanics
one of the less games that actually get out of EA
You will need nato pc to run this game smooth LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  esport ready D D D D D
One of the most best game what i ve ever played on my life 910
REEEEEEEEE
if you want so see how a pure Garbage  I know it is not in the Mendeleev s table looks buy this PURE GARBAGE very fascinating
thar is some hackars playing it
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing hacker
A f King broken LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
fun game with mates not by yourself lol
Devs doing nothing about hackers don t waste your money
Great game and very addictive even with its repetitive gameplay I wish they add more features in the game to up the wow factor
This game has so much potential but month after month nothing is made  every single patch the game seems laggier for me better than on first patch thou as every single beta pre selled gameMost servers are terrible bad players desyncing as crazy when picking loots in the beginning of the matchThe HUD on the lobby is actually broken mostly doesnt work and has a refresh button  that says a lot doesnt it This game is actually growing as crazy because of no launches and other competitors being worse than thisA lot of players are cheating and using macros mostly not getting banned but if you happen to kill a streamer you may get yourself bannedThe dev sold about 10million copys and just can t afford a SA DUO FPP or even other regions FPP server thats just sad
worst game i ve ever played in my life
YOU WILL MEET A CHEATER IN EVERY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SINGLE GAME
This game teachs you how to get   MOTIVATION  1 First step find Kar98Supressor  SRscope  8X and m16Supressor AR2 Second step go loot some house on poLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE i and then when u are looting wc die for a man who have micro uzi first helmet and no kevlar 119 naked mans with motorcycle helmets
EDIT NEW REVIEW  After some recent changes by the Devs this game is finally shapinig up to be the game I wanted it to be They ve struck the ban hammer down hard Also with recent performance tweaks by the dev and some pretty simple launch option tweaks on my end I m finally running the game at an acceptable 50 60 fps with mediumhigh settings Now my only complaint is the abundance of people in Asia playing on NA servers Regardless with the recent changes I m changing my review to recommend the game Seriously no other game gets my heart pumping like this one Great game
bad optimization 9 Gb consume of ram wtf
This game just gets better and better every time they update it Very fun game and very addictive They have improved the game so much I have updated this review beacuse they have released the 10 updare and it is now out of realy access which means there aren t anymore bugs in the game and i can finally say that you should buy it right away1010 beacuse the looks of this game is amazing The 10 launch has completely made it off the charts What are you waiting for   BUY IT
If your buying this and you plan on playing Oceanic you might want to wait until they can bring the hackers under controlUpdate 250118 Hackers are still a big problemUpdate 030518Hackers less of a problem now getting there
Awesome game ruined by cheaters
Best game i ve played my fav game  
  too many speed hackersalmost everytime
FUn
MYGHAD PLS FIX THE BUGS AND OPTIMIZATION BEFORE DOING THOSE ShhhhITTTTTTYYYYYY CAR AND MAP UPDATES YODILINTE TRANSLATE THAT BLUEHOLE  COUGHS  ASSHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLEFAGGOOOOOOOOOOOOTTPS I STILL LIKE THE GAME HUEHUEHEHEHEHUEHEHUE
it s a good game but it does not have solo and duo for south america servers710would bang again
Performance  both client and server is shit Props buildings and player models just wont load resulting in you get stuck or dying and bullets that were fired after you got behind cover will still catch you And I don t know how they come up with such minimum system requirements   I can barelly get 30 fps on i5 4690k with gtx 760 and 8gb ram  20gb pagefile   and the game constantly freezes and crashes Buy this only if you have one of these top latest everything gaming rig like these famous streamers do Otherwise avoid
Too many hackers using ESP and aimbot No longer fun Bluehole s software team are the OG noobs
it s so bad I played 100 hours Like it was totally out of force My friends claimed they would hurt me if I didn t play so I played and now it its like good Thanks for reading
I used to love this game and I even played five to six hours a day and I quit smoking But the last ten nine people cheat and then do not take coercive measures the game will be more and more no confidence really do not want to play
I love not knowing where im being shot from when im laying down behind a rock in the top ten Thats always nice Don t see anyone have a groza and a kar meds attachements ammo and level three everything only to not know where im getting shot from and immediatly dying This is a game that gets 2 million players DAILY  And people can t even tell where they are getting shot from half the time This is what I call a good game
Just going with trend I personally like this game very much Everything is fine and playeble and so far is the best game in the worldBut world is cruel place so Bluehole sucks
If you want a loot simulator and a camping simulator this game is for you If you want an actual shooter don t play this game 
it s good bro
If you can get past performance issues this game is tons of fun It has some great gunplay remenicent of arma some pretty standard graphics  nothing special and pans Worth it
over 50  of the games have aimbotters speed hackers and aholes who shoot through wallsThis can be a great game if Bluehole can get rid of the available hacks until that time stay away
Really good team play and does great job keeping hackers out
Too many hackers playing this game On most maps by the time you land there are already people on the ground looted buildings and already armed When you jump and hit max free fall you see people fly past you You also get headshot by an UZI from far away while you are in a moving vehicle too often to be luck I have also been in a game where i had level 3 helmet and vest I go into a building shoot someone 4 times in the chest to no effect then they turn around and 1 shot meUntil they spend some of the millions of dollars they have made off of this game to get rid of the cheatershackers I will never play it TOTAL waste of money i regret ever buying this and wish it wasnt too late to get my money back I would rather wipe my  with the cash instead of playing this trash
it Is very nice C 
This game is sh t with all the meaning of this word Don t buy this game You will waste your money
This game is well made along with realistic sounds and simulation
This game has nothin to offer a simple idea with good workers but its fun and due to its player base its a good competition There are some problems hope they get solved at release
way too addictive  D haha
Me   head punch someone 10 times who landed after i did Also Me   dies to guy in 1 punch UPDATE  112317   Wouldnt consider it to be GOTY at all please dont do this
its a good game but theres still some glithes but thats why its in beta but it was so worth to buy
It s not bad
I no longer have to get my lazy rear out of my chair for exercise because this game makes my heart race to much Loving this
I love this game SOOOOOOOOOO much The only down side to this is that you need a beast PC to actually run it Hell if my computer was fast enough I would record it So please make it more easy to run the game
PUBGAn international phenomenon but amazing success backed by less than ideal developers who refuse to fix their servers yet roll around in piles of moneyThis game is a lot of fun and I ve had some of the best gaming moments with my friends during the intense gun fights but it is saturated with Poor design choices looks absolutely terrible and runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  as well as makes you question what you are doing with your day to day life and whether you should pursue producing and designing a video game in Korea and reap the profitsI cannot reccomend this game yet I will still play itA solid 510
PLAYERUNKONWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a game in which multiple players fight to be the last player alive This game will test your patience reflexes and your ability to survive against unpredictable odds PROS Up to 4 friends can be in a squad Tight controls Vehicles Character customization Character aesthetics Plenty of online players Gigantic Map Reasonable price Intense gameplay Beautiful graphicsCONS  Can only have up to 4 friends in a squad  Which is fine although 50 vs 50 would be tight  Tiny bit of a hacker problem  The vechicles flip way to easily off road  Please for the love of god fix that  If you don t like how your character looks anymore that ll cost you 3000 in game units  Loot boxes cost less  Character aesthetics can only be earned through loot crates  Their s a 67  chance you will get banned if you kill someone who s streaming  Only one map so far  You can t pay in game currency for aesthetics only real money  Only one gamemode  Extremely unoptimized resource heavyIn it s entirety PUBG takes what we love from the strive and survive genere and builds upon that to create the most immersivesurvival shooter i have ever played It definitely is more than a mindless shooter as it requires you to take risks and plan your next move Although it does unarguably has a few kinks it needs to be worked out the developers are working hard to make sure it further locks its position as the 1 game on steam with the most concurent players910

This game is very fun at times There are many bugs that need to be fixed though
Im not one to put out reviews but GOD DAMN this one makes me have to If you are a fan of this game type then dont bother buying this game at the moment Bluehole has already said they have to many players for the servers and yet havent done LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to make it better I have never had so many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server connections in my life and now that BLUEHOLE has made their 300 MILLION from the game they dont feel the need to fix LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  just pump out a retail version which will only cause more server issuesgood plan Bluehole LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing dumbasses
nice game  
Terrible Servers terrible vehicle physics cancerous player base only useful when you re bored and can t find another game to play
So tired of this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t game I enjoy this type of game play but how this game is executed is just horrible I don t write reviews for anything often unless their is a serious issue but this is really getting bad Servers are horrible with constant lag getting you killed or ruining expierence Last 10 rounds I ran around for couple minutes straight in high spawn zones just to find a pistol and get killed instantly by someone slingshotting around from the lag and shooting you through walls This game has got considerably worse since I ve bought it and take this review from someone who wins matches often highly Don t buy this piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  until they finally decide to throw money at it and fix the servers and spawning Seriously get rid of the useless clothing spawn you re creating unecessary lag spawning that crap in Cut down on the pistol attachments and less pistols It makes the game boring
Good game maan
too many cheatersdo something plz BH
Too many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  guys cheat on this game During the most recently 5 games I and my teammates met at least 8 users hacked These supermen could kill all my group members in 1sec with a damn AKM and then flash to somewhere Can t believe that the official of PUBG did not make any responses to this I love this game so I really do not want this game being ruined by 1  or 2  people
if they are not going to add map selection before savage comes out the game isnt even worth playing horrible devs
When you re after hassle free sex   you know you should nt message  that girl  At the time you think its a good idea it ll be different this time but then you get there and realise nothing has changhed You ve made a mistake Avoid this game message  that girl  instead
The newest circle changes were so good But the rollback made the game unplayable in some circumstances again Awesome game otherwise
This game is such a joke Aparantly its above human limitations to jump over a fence
Could u plz bulid a better serv  A sshole rathan bluehole
This game is buggy but more importantly it is boring I dont want to spend any of my precious time repeating the smae action over and over and over If you like skydiving onto the exact same area that you did in your last match only to be out gunned by your neighbor because you got the short end of the RNG stick luck should never be the deciding factor in a skill based shooter I hate brenden Greene almost as much as I hate the fact that I missed my 2 hour refund window for this piece of garbage
Very addictingI hope they patch up Zombie Mode and players can climb trees etc on the next updateWorth the  two thumbs up
Fun at first has got worse with the addition of the mini 14 and the trash servers and hit reg new and refreshing cant save it now
Very nice game I never played a enjoyable game like this with my friends
If you dont have 16 gb of ram don t even bother I refunded everything looks like a marshmallow
I have got hacked in my mail account and once I have retrive it and changed my password i noticed that my steam account been vac banned by  PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS  this is totally unfair especially that I bought the game and bought some items in the market aswell I want full refund for both the game price and the market items aswell I liked the game honestly but after this incidence I am against their reaction No fair
BIGLY fun
An amazing Batte royale gameBetter than other competitive title like H1Z1 KOTK Just Played for 7 hours  After A day of buying the gameThe developers need to optimize it when the game gets releasedAmazing and Fun to play with friends  3
I enjoy dis gam very muc it hel mu autifm
Minecraft Survial Games 2 now with gun mods
Nothing but Cheaters  Pull down your pants and hold your ankles
From the first day this game was released it looked like a lot of fun People started recording it and uploading it on the Youtubes The game legit looked and sounded really really fun After a while of waiting for the game to get some bugs fixed I decided to buy the game  I couldnt wait anymore From the start the game seemed really really sick The graphics looked nice the music the HUD  everything We got into a game and intantly died  the usual and we were too hyped to stop Second or third game in is when things started to roll down hill Me and my friends couldnt start a game because the game auto cancelled our game and we were confused We decided to hop into the Eu  usually NA servers and played fine for a bit and then it happened  Network Lag Detected  If you get this game expect to see this A LOT The game is still in beta and is still getting fixed I went on the forums on the interwebs and tons and tons of people are experiancing the same issues as everyone else Again this game is in beta  it needs time to fix and perfect Although the game has its issues its super fun to play Dont be discouraged Time will come and this game will be legendary
This game is one of the most fun games I ve played in a long time Solo is fun but playing Duo  with one other friend and Squads  with two or more friends is the best Had issues at the start with a  Network Lag Detected  error where it kicked me from games and would take a few minutes to rejoin However once I fixed this issue the game has been a blast Yeah you ll die a lot You probably won t get a chicken dinner on your first run but for some reason I still enjoy spawning looting killing and dying over and over again For an early access game this is fantastic Now let s just hope the developers actually push it out of early access unlike most games
ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IVE PLAYED STILL NEEDA UPDATE ON MANY BUGS AND OFC NEED MORE CRATES AND CLOTHES   CHEERS 
This game is really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing broken
when you re not playing with hackers its a really fun experience that is taking over my life
If you d like RNG Base shooter s then this is the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing game for you because i can check 8 builds and not get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  at best a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing level 1 helmet and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing uzi
Pretty funny when playing with ur friendsXD
addictive concept yet very poorly executed  clunky gameplay laggy desync faulty netcode INSANE LOAD OF CHEATERS bugs and glitchesstatistically more than 10  of its playerbase are using cheats a serious topic which is being kept low profile not to damage the game s reputation any furtherfurther the majority of its playerbase comes from China hence the Chinese are needed to fill up empty servers worldwide regardless of lag issues causedthis game should not be on the market due to its boarderline criminal operations with regards to lootbox gambling and false information given to its players
Best Shooting game in a long time ago
I m doing my part  Ads in an unoptimized game  No thank you
your server is always full why  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
20 Dollars for a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing rip off Nice servers
I hate the bug the hacker and everything yet can t stop playing Dont fall into the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of this game like me   
this game just a bug
DONT BUY THIS GAME This game is horrible for 30Have a lot of bugs bad optimalization and untradable skinsthere is a lot of unnecessary updates but any necessary update will not comeU can spent better your 30
worst game ever
buy it trust me
Constant lag
Luck based trash game with tons of bugs and very bad servers not worth 30e Do not buy the early access version Just don t
The shooting mechanics are pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is simply unplayable I would like my 3000 back
I can t play this game Waste of money Too many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s hacking
Where do I even begin with this  Hackers galore Inexcusable lag Anti cheat that is based on the hours you have and the amount of kills you have per game   will explain later on  and the lazyness of the devs I started playing this game about 1 year ago and back then it was honestly one of the best games i had ever played especially seince it was the first battle royale game I had ever played I m a casual player who generally only plays this game with friends so most of my hours spent in this game have been in squads on the good ol  map  back before hackers ruled the game   and no it wasn t a good player since I don t think even a good player could headshot you while you are prone in the upstairs of a house with a pistol Just sayinLag has always been an issue in PUBG since the very beginning especially in the beginning of the matches when you first land Back about a year ago this was never really an issue as we knew it was in early access and just rolled with it  since we knew it was  hopefully going to be polished and profected in the future Welp 1 year later and we are still haveing inexcusable lag in matches not just at the start but throughout the entire game  its like their servers aren t meant to handle this many players playing their game Now their anti cheat is good in thought but very impractical while in actual use To get more than 6 kills in a game you need 200 hours to get 10 kills you need 500 hours and in order to get 20 kills you need to get 1000 hours in the game So if you have a friend that just started playing and only has 98 hours are really good at fps games such as armam and get 7 kills they are banned within 24 hours  This counts for event also such as the war event that is taking place currently A firend of mine found out the hard way and now bought a 4th account just so we could play together still on weekendsNow in order for a game to be successful you need updates regularly and changing the speed of the playzone doesn t count either The last update this game has had was when it was released fully back in December and that was the AUG I admit new guns are fun at times but when the game is still struggling to run even on good pc s thats what they should focus on  not by pleasing the youtubers and content creators with new guns to try to reel them back in to this pos gameI loved this game in the beginning but to all you who are thinking about getting it i d suggest saving your money till the issues get fixed
robbed for 30usd
This game has some of the worst servers ever I used to think it was just my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  internet until I started playing rainbow six siege and had no issue And that game has some LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers
Devs that tie their game to Steam   sold millions over Steam and opt out of Steam community discussions because it would cost them too much  sorry   i like the game especially as it s even fun for casuals but this is a step that makes a recommendation obsolete  and it countermeasures everything Steam stands for 
I like the game cause its fun
Played PUBG some before I knew what is the root of this game   Eventually getting loot boxes that drop items that use Steam s trading system and have a real life monetary value in them  I m going to say that while the game in itself is interesting enough  Basically it s a Battle Royale style game Think hunger games the thing that makes me queazy is that you eventually get  coins  to  Buy  RNG boxes which randomly drop items that have a real life value on them  It essentially turns game like this into gambling simulators   play some potentially make or lose money on loot boxes  Also enables you to buy them through steam for real life money in the hopes you win a high value skirt  which can be upwards of around 300  That s some actual big money for what this is here or something else so you can literally turn a profit from this game  Why is this disgusting to me It feeds gambling addiction  And it teaches it to potential youngsters playing it  Let s be honest   Games like this PvP arena battles that are over inulged on twitch are  famously  played on majority by teens  Things like this and CS GO seem to encourage and teach that  Gambling is fun  something which could lead  many  people into gambling in the future and honestly now that it has real money on the line can cripple some poor kids and un knowing adults tooYou d think steam would learn from the debacle with that youtuber that ran the  CS GO  skin site and how everyone saw him as skeevy  This whole practice of selling lootboxes with items that have real value is skeevy  I hope that something stops this in the future it is a  gross  practice
Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is an extremely addictive battle royale game that some people hate and some people loveThe optimisation isn t necessarily good but it improves from update to update and the game should run well on a somewhat decent rig Graphics also aren t very impressive but it s common for a lot of the top competitive gamesThe rules are pretty much like in all of the battle royale games You wait in a lobby fly a plane jump from it onto the map arm up and try to surviveFor an early access game there are quite a lot of weapons And the developers add new every now and then For now there is only one map but the devs promised to add two more in the future For now the only thing that changes from game to game are weather conditions Even though the game seems pretty repetitive it s one of the most addictive games I ve ever playedUpdates come out pretty often And they usually bring significant changes to the game Like better optimisation mentioned above weapons etcA lot of people are upset because the devs had promised that they would not implement any paid crates until the game is fully released And they didn t keep their word They added  Gamescom crates  for a limited time and keys that are only obtainable for real money I personally don t see much of a problem with that as the items are purely optional and cosmetic which means that they won t give you any in game advantageThe conclusion Even though the game is in early access I recommend it for people who like competitive games In my opinion PUBG is the best battle royale game at least for now And I hope that it s one of the few games that won t be in early access forever
i would give up everything and just PUBG my entire life
I enjoy playing it especially with friends and some family in there as well The game is difficult as all  battle royales are I hope you do buy this because it is well worth it
good mode game
new war mode is the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
CHINA GO HOMEPS Hackers are Scum
I have never seen so many cheaters in a TPSFPS game Yes it is one of the shooting games so cheating softwares are inevitable But just look at the leaderboard of each of the server It is a shame to have all the top 10s being aim bot providers Pay more attention to your game BH
I was on the fence about buying this game There was a spike in negative reviews a few days prior before buying and numerous complaints about hackers getting banned in game advertising   haven t seen an ad so maybe programmers took them down and some other things I can t remeber that were complained about Anyways I took a chance and bought it and walked into the game with a mindset that this game might be a POS I couldn t have been more wrong  I ve been a huge Battlefield fan  Excluding Hardline for obvious reasons and the newest BF  since Bad Company 2 and I also really enjoy Counter Strike Those are my go to FPS but now I m conflicted because this alpha release game is one hell of a contender My heart is racing playing this when I m inside a house and I know somebody close by is on the lurk It s like I just hit the best line of coke and I m watching UFC the adrenaline has my heart pounding so much The game is still young yet so awesome already I ve been playing this game for less than 24 hours and I m ready to pull an all nighter on it if server maintanence doesn t disturb my mojo Look if your not sure if you want this game but have had a GROWING interest watching videos of people playing it It s time to submerge your ballsva jayjay in it s waters I give this game 1010 stars with the hopesimpression it s going to grow into a franchise that competes with the big league FPS games out there Like if this review gave you herpes
So many bugs and obviously they use Early Access as a shield  Oh we ll fix it it s early access Come back to this review in say a years time Willing to bet my LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing kidney it still is in early accessIt s a fun game but the bugs make it unplayable at times Buildings not loading dying from fall damage while running on the floor for a good 10 minutes Stuff like this is why I give this a negative review Will change it if they fix the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
It s pretty good but you really gotta like games where you have to learn the intricacies of the system I ve seen a lot of people burnt out because they expected a run and gun shooter like CoD or something but this is more tactical than probably a majority of games you ve played before Stay in it for the long haul and you ll be rewarded boy
this game is praised and i understand it is still in development yet it could be alot better Very unrewarding and often makes me feel like ive wasted time when playing You run around scavenging for ten minutes then die or die almost right after landing by a punch to the face while you had shot the person 4 times point blank with a pistol Outside of games there is no reward system In game points you get give you lootbox that contains very bland cosmetic items Imagine if in overwatch there was weekly loot box and everytime you earned a box it got progressively harder to obtain the next until the week was done and the rarity of the items never changed In duo and squad i can rarely have my team or partner alive or connected past the first minute PLease dont play solo
My game is allways crashing and lagging
This Game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING BAD LOVE LOVE LOVE  1010
It wont let me leave my party and it glitchy all round
You ever hear of China 
Boo hoo i am not famous anymore I copied Minecraft Hunger Games s Edition and am now sueing Epic Games cause their game is more fun This game is more walking that shooting
love this gamen on xbox but pc is better
released a new map  What a bout the 3 seater bike or the glitch where weapons poke through the wall  Buthole corporation you are trash
JEBO VAM PAS MATER STA VI RADITE HOCETE NAPRAVITI OVO GOVNO SA 100 BAGOVA     
I love this game so much i can get so many hours in this game There is some things that are annoying like servers not letting me and my friends connect but other wise its super fun If you are looking for a game to play with you and your friends this is the game for you Also you are always getting better there isnt a point where you can say  I completed the game  or  Im really good  cause every game has a diffrent outcome I love it and tottaly recommend it 10 out of 10
Infested with chinese cheaters
I ve only played a little but so far so good
Lit game 1010 fam only if i could win  P
Game was a good idea but very poorly executed It keeps disconnecting me every time I finish a match I get no points for playing because of this so my character is just constantly naked The game likes to lag out from time to time and it s not on my end Servers constantly give me errors from being too full Overall the game is about 90  running around in the woods or towns listening to distant gunfire and explosions and then 10  being shot in the back through a wall from a mile away with an SKS
it s an okay game 1010
It s a good game I suck at it but it s fun to just get online
Nice to play but need to ban some hack users
Right now sadly noi really enjoy this game but as time has passed its turned into a clown fiestaall servers ive played on are full of chinese players who lag  and some mostly cheatthe  report system is clown shoes because the death cam is a total joke toobut nothing seems to get done to the cheaters that are on top of the leaderboard with like average 30 kill games and 99  headshot killsthe games full of bugs whats still not been fixed since day 1Blueahole keep adding unwanteduseless and un needed skins to the game and the hackers come back with a vengance and get crazy amounts of BP s to get these useless skins to sell  some for stupid money I m not suprised this game is mostly negative at all
A lot of people are complaining about performance optimization and servers being down once a week for an hour and even streamers getting people banned for  stream sniping  All of those are true and are issues with the game but are fixable in the long run and offer minor inconveniences if you contact the supportWith that said there is one big thing that I have to give props for  There is virtually no hackers I have played for 100 hours and all of that is playing games and not idle and I have never seen an obvious hacker I say obvious as in automatic headshot with a pistol 500 meters away or ESP that shouldn t be possible Every scenario that I have died in I think none of them were for illegitemate reasonsAnyways with that out of the way the gameplay is amazing I am running on a gtx 960 2GB 16 GB of ram and an i7 6700k and get rougly 60 100 fps with low settings and max view distance Shooting is amazing the map is fantastic and I am hopeful for what is to come with this game There is tons of variety in guns and attachements and there is always a sense of suspense when you are in a house and hear doors opening Also  Make sure that you play with a mouse and a headset Trackpads will not work with this game you will die to everyone you meet If you lack earbuds or headphones of some kind you will also be lacking in the stealth department when you need to hear where enemies are and where shots are coming from Overall 1010 game for me I have had no bad experiences with hackers game performance and only small issues with servers  Albeit in the middle of the night I recommend this game to everyone who like stealth shooters and doesn t rage too much when they die Great to play with friends Just make sure your system meets the requirements before you buy it or you will not have the best time
Great game however now it never opens and iv e done everything known to man kind to try and fix it im fed up and now think this game is crap if they fix it that ll change my answer but atm the game is broken doesn t open and keeps saying sorry for the crash send a report to help fix it which iv e sent hundreds ofFinal rating 310 would be 1010 for the game in general but with issues its crapCheersPS please fix the issues ASAP
Pretty fun game Not bad for early access
Its fun af
Very good only if it was easy to run which it isn t I have a 960 ti and I only get 50 60 fps and a i7
Cheater everywhere recently good game
All try hards and impossible to pick up as a casual gamer
Honestly doesn t deserve the bad press it gets Still the 1 best and most addicting game of the year for most
just isn t fun
The game was quite fun but I ve no clue about the patches in 2018 becauseServers are too busy please try again later
Chinese hackers captured the leaderboard and no one gets bannedfuvk blue holeeven LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t is better than your anti hacker policy
Gets better Updates were slow for abit but are back on pointUpdatedGame is still good and runs alot better but now there is chinese hackers in every game no exceptions Cant recommend until they fix this
Get H1Z1 improve graphics here you go you have this game   Bought it played with low performance and it s really sick when you playing action games with 20 30 fps killed by team mates  many times and refunded I think they collecting programmers from markets which cashier If you wanna throw your money so you can buy it
if players can teamming in solo mode and you can not even report them  we all know the report system is uselessthis game is going to its end
This game is suck I regret buying this game
  
Very good game to have fun with friends in a lobby
A good game but if you dont have the best pc in the world  one that can just run it and you drop from the plane early your textures wont be loaded in and it will be a bit laggy but when they load in every thing is fine
to much server lag
ET ES GUG GAEM
LIIIIIIIIT
This game is a gamblers paradise Its gun mechanics are fantastic and the ending is full of tension which is really exhileratingThe loot in this game has terrible RNG You are likely to go through multiple buildings and not find even a pistol It can result in uneven disadvantaged fights or looting for too long trying to find a decent weapon and a sight with no car around getting terrible circle RNG and having to run across the entire map for 34 of the game This is very fustrating boring and happens way too often The blue circle is mechanics are annoying It isn t a big disdvantage for players until the very last few safe zones come into factor So players can sit in and move around safely inside the circle for a good chunk of the game With the size of the map the possibility of no vehicle and the terrible loot RNG you will often be forced to run to the safe zone with terrible weapons few meds and sights Chance is a bigger factor in this game than skill which should not be the case
lack of detail  terrible server  tons of bugs  many tons of cheaters
If you don t have a high end PC do not even think about buying it game is poorly optimized My pc is better than the suggested specs and I run the game at lowest settings Yet I drop to 1 fps
this has got to be one of the coolest games ive ever played  super fun with a bunch of friends in the squad play for sure worth buying 
One of hte best games that I have ever played  I just team killed a hacker on my teamteleporting around the map and mass killing everyone with head shotsand then I got killd by another hackerUnacceptable
Well err PUBG where do i start this game is very frustrating at times it is one of the many battle royale shooters probably the biggest of them all so lets get on with the reviewGameplay 810 The long range combat is amazing but the close range combat is annoying and theres loads of people who will just sit in houses and wait for you and third person peak you round cornersStory it has no storyFun 910 This game is extremely fun but it can be boring as you can go 20 minutes without seeing one person i would recommend playing with friends for maximum funPerformance 6510 this game is extremely demanding on specs i have a 1080ti and on ultra in some cases can dip below 60 i wouldnt recommend playing on ultra as its better to keep some setting low for visibility i know its an early acces game but it just feels like game developers are just slapping a early acces sticker on to use as an excuse for poor performance a bit like DayZ There is also loads of bugs like textures not loading in resulting in people being able ot drive and walk through wallsPlaytime 910 ive put nearly 200 hours in as of this review and every game still feels fresh even though its the same map everytime Bluehole are adding a new map meaning another excuse for me to put hundreds more hours into this gameOverall 8510 Pick it up now it is worth it
well i m always top 10 even though i did not kill anyone haha players are always busy looting and killing they forgot the most important rule  safe zone 
Nice game But there is a bug that makes me crash every time I start up the game or Exit to lobby It began at the  PC Update 5  since I wasn t able to start or exit the game without crashing I run the game at 80 fps  130 max I tried everything that could help and nothing helped
Amazing Game Lots Of Content Great GamePurchase
I Think Its so worthy of the price and reputation 910 would buy again
Bro I aam gettin mad wins not really though
UNABLE TO RUN THIS GAME PROPERLY PC SPECS ARE AWESOME STILL ITS LAGGING AT 90FPS THE WORST GAME OF ALL TIME
Patch 10 is amazing the optimazition is better than before  needs some inprovements but its ok I  recommend buying this game
It s pretty gooooooood You ll laugh you ll cry trust within the squad can be at high tensions at times but damn is it addictive
Great game  There is a little bit of something for everyone  You can camp it out and suck at the game or drop in and fight it out with the best of the best  Find your guns boys and put a few bullets in the right place
uh turns out its pretty ok
aight game
Game would be a good game if they didn t ban people for honking at Streamers
This game has some serious flaws Getting shot when you are behind cover because the server and game performance is terrible is infurating when its performing as it should it is a great game Ignore all the rubbish about  stream snipe i got banned blah blah  The reality is for the vast majority of the people that play this game is the lag desync and related BS is more of an issue Edit  This game is now bag Well into 10 13 now i think and getting shot behind walls whislt in cover etc due to TERRIBLE lag desync and the shocking server side performance make this game unbearable Which is a shame Its a game you desperately want to be good but then I you peak back into cover and then die    nah LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game Another game studio will take this idea and make a version that runs properly
I recommend
Though bluehole made a statement to say that there is no white listbutwhy  55kai  Lu BenWei one of the most popular streamer in China his repeated cheating behavior is still being ignored so much evidence we have collected why do you bluehole remain silent really good gamecheaters  heaven players  hell                                                                                 bad bad bad gamenew map  new weapon  f c k itplz stop these cheaterslove this game but  not recommend
Once you own this say goodbye to your social life
Game is very fun More fun with friends that you can talk to using Discord or another chat service Remember this is still early access so for those wondering  yes there is server lag yes they are still working on bugs and yes you will encouter other problems It takes a bit to get used to bullet travel  best loot areas watching your own back in solo and vehicle spawnsThe only issue I ll have to agree with all these not recommended reviews is the streamer snipes Many people are getting banned  stream sniping  yet most people don t even watch twitch especially streamers who are bad just placing blame for the sake of their rep with watchers Once this issue gets fixed between the developers and their players I won t really have anything negative to say as of now
The game is a good game but the server optimization is too poor everyday always apologize China contribute so much is not in the game player set up a server what time servers in the mainland what time I give you praiseThese are Machine Translation
Great game but FULL of hacks Aimbots ESP etc You ll be lucky to play a single game without getting headshot out of a moving vehicle etc Aside from that vehicle physics are HORRIBLE you ll flip after hitting tiny bumps get stopped cold by bushes and invisible rocks The game play is great aside from all the issues missing many of the final touches like being able to kick AFK from group and friends won t show up in the menu if they re in gamesNo polish on a weekly basis or a monthly basis I can t actually tell if they re actively trying to improve the game or not In 3 months or so playing all I ve seen done is a few weapons addedHopefully they get their act together figure out how to stop the bots polish the game and it ll be AWESOME
servers are garbage
This game is fun and all but being kick because of their LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers is so tilting This game has LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing servers
Got Top 10 twice Died both times cause i got ran over by a car or i got smacked to death with a pan1010 gamewill play again
If you like cheaters and chinese R3T4RD you will definitely love this game feel free to waste your money its a cheaters paradise
I reallyyyyyyyyyyy want to tell you this game is great and it s worth the 30 you will spend on it as well as all the hype behind it being true but honestly I can t As someone with over 350 hours plus in the game please listen to me when I say stay away and save your 30 for now Think about spending that money on a gmae thats far better developed than this The game isn t anywhere near worth 30 in its current state Maybe down the road when they fix all of the issues that destroy this game then it will be amazing but for right now I wouldn t buy it if I knew what I was getting into to
One of das best racing games out there by far If you ever player dota 2 you can see why this game is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE en terribel I recommmedn playing with stereo
Someone needs to check into NA Solo leaderboards Seems like one dude with ten accounts has hacked his way into top ten spots already Got a screenshot of the leaderboard if it is needed Just noticed this last night and there is no way that is possible without cheating some way Other than that I love the game
Servers are trash No replay on how or why you get killedand why the hell do i have to double click to aim 
PUBG   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    fortnite  
The most ridiculous thing about this game is that you have to have a computer that is 900  AUD like my pc to run it at low medium settings H1Z1 Just Survive I could run that game on the max settings  Very High and have no problems but this game seems to wanna destroy your pc 1000 should do the trick if you want to run the game at medium high Not worth your money   time if your pc is not godlike
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Dope A Highly ADDICTIVE DRUG
Great game literally heart pudding antisapation of every sound you hear
I really enjoy playing this game and i recommend you to buy it if you like battle royal games But this game is hard to play on older computers so i think you should have atleast 16gb of ram and a gtx1060
As much as i enjoy the mechanics and gameplay  I cannot get over the unyielding bulls  t players pull     I doubt that having an entire thirty round magazine of 762 fired into your ribcage would afford you a chance to turn and fire a single shot killing your assailant     yet thanks to the unique and frustrating cheats being made availablethat is exactly what I encounter on a near constant basis       game is great    cheaters are trash
Is a good game i love playing itBut is so bad optimizeitedMake the full Beta of the gameBut is so cool game to play whit freinds and is good for singleplayer mod
What an incredible game In just 2 months reaching 2 million concurrent players and causing a total disruption in the gaming scene I highly recommend this game if you like playing casual or seriously The game is fun with friends and even just playing solo
Heckith Yeah
VERY FUN BUT NOT FINISHED SO CANT SAY BUY IT HACKERS AND UNFINISHED BUT STILL FUN SOMEHOW
Ciao ni ma                                    
Laggy bugfest with a kinda toxic playerbase I can t stop playing
Shoot the idiots who walk into ur house gg get a 15 times with a awm and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  them hard Its like Gordan Ramsay shoving his rolling pin in your LOVE LOVE LOVE  for a period of 10 minutes and then later findinig out your father left you because you were straight
Great game but they are trying to expand a game that isnt expandable The Event  War  is just plain dog turd Unforunately it is repetitive but doesnt have the competitiveness of something like CS GO to keep it going in the log run With crate gathering abuse by what seems to be entire companies dropping 90 odd bot clients into a map and having them scripted to do nothing but jump so they can collect Battle Points and hackers which have seemed less and less over time I feel that it is slowly losing its charmI see the player base dwindling eventually but thats not to say it hasnt been a blast in the mean time
4 months spent to implement changes to blue zone They conduct 4 tournaments with new blue zone They updated the zone and revert it on the next day bcs few chinese said that the delay is so low They didnt even revert updates with huge bugs but they revert the only good update This game has huge online only because there s no alternatives
Do you want to get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  to no end  Do you want to have your cursor on someone up close only to miss  Do you want to look through a scope and see people on your screen only to pull the trigger and shoot a wall because the scope doesn t see the same thing the end of the barrel does  Want to run around for 10 mins looting only to die by someone you can t see or a blue line  Want to run into buildings with no loot only for them to have loot 5 minutes later because weapon load times are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   Then this is the game for youAddendum  I hope fortnite ruins you Plus it s free
Dissapointing
this game is the decentest game on steam there are so many LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing problems with it yet it s so much fun diconnects randomly rejoin somewhat quickly game crashes improving frames low game quality for best performance everyone is better than me buy it if you hate yourself will ruin your entire life and make you want to uninstall steam forever stick your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  into a pencil sharpener All in all worth the cash my dudes
THE PAN
Hello everyone and welcome to IGN today we will be reviewing Playerunknowns BattlegroundsPlayerunknowns Battlegrounds or PUBG for short is a simulation that puts 100 likeminded people on an island the objective of the simulation is to find out what these 100 people will do to each other Research and reports of the simulation has proved that the sole intent of the people who are placed on the island is to kill each other Instead of building a civilization the people who are placed on the island want to brutally murder each other with an assortment of weaponry As an game journalist for 1 week now and one of IGN s lead writers i think that this game is alot like Dark Souls in that it is very difficult and unforgiving for both its players and their computers  of course i have to name here the fact that the game is also available on the microsoft Xbone KEKOverall the game is quite good as an experienced relatable gamer from IGN who was able to finish Cupheads tutorial level after a week i give this game a very respectable solid rating of 9510 An almost flawless experience Also thank you for the generous sponsorship from the PUBG corporation that helped this review be possibleFor everything related to Playerunknowns Battlegrounds stay right here on IGN
After MONTHS of being on the Steam Store for a hefty 30 dollars the game still runs like an online shooter from 1990 s comparable to the first Counter Strike or BattleField 1944 Comparatively those games run better and you are allowed to play the videogame you paid money for Currently stuck at  too many logins  error and cannot play a game I paid money for Highly reccomend against anyone who values polish or sentient devolopers
I come from a longtime background of BR and open world survival games starting with DayZ mod Epoch Breaking Point etc Overall I like PUBG in small doses but it s hard for me to really get intoOne major downside for me is shooting someone a bunch of times while they freely run away I enjoy realism it is inherent to this genre I would like to see combat become less like an arcade game Think of Call of Duty vs Squad That s the best comparison I can make Changing the base game isn t a necessity either    They could add a  realism  or  hardcore  mode for people wanting a realistic experience Options are always good and draw a wider player base
Great game Tons of replayability Laugh with your buddies when you roll and flip your Dacia 37 times and land on all fourscry tears of joy when you own 99 scrubs in solos overall lots of fun
please dont buy this bugged game
CAN WE BAN THESE ASIAN HACKERS FROM THIS GAME         
Better then KOH
I ve been playing in this game it about 77 hours and I can probably say that is this game really LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  because of community peOple which makes nothing with the bagSliterally I didn t get any coins from the game it s happen every time when I m playing in this gameUnfortunately optimization is too bad for the new highmedium end pc but on low end Pc is g00d D mean that low end has 30fps without any crashes and smth like that and other pc has these situations when game is blowing with fps therefore  DD XDEEEE g1v a fakLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 1n  ac of hiT game dont buy itthe worst game ever
So after around 120 hours of playtime and coming on and off only to play for high priced lootcrates this game is still trash Still buggy poorly optimized high priced trash Now with the bonus feature of having a new hacking playerbase that will NEVER go away To put in perspective I recently redownloaded Dead by Daylight as in the past it shared a lot in common with PUBG in terms of performance It had latency issues tons of lag and needed a lot of fixes And you know what  It ACTUALLY improved shocking I know after playing this for so long I thought improvement was a foreign concept too So you know what I m just going to play that game instead unless my friend wants someone to play this then I ll stomach this game Seriously it s getting to the point where even playing with friends this game blows The one thought that will forever haunt me thanks to this game  I wasted 30 30 that I bet would be better spent on LITERALLY anything else
Nc game  lo recomiendo al 100 
First off to be fair the game is still in early access so the fact that runs like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  is not all that shocking Sadly it is less about the game and more about how bluehole and at times brendan greene himself treat players like LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and show flat out greed They have more money now then they could have imagined and now we have less free content and not a lot to show for it All new LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  they add is in a box I need to buy or 350 on the marketI had my fun with the game but untill there is an attitude change from the devs and perhaps finally a new map I cannot recommend it
Well the game is great It needs optimization  Of course SA server at least needs improvement South America is pretty big it should be 1 server for South america and another one for Central America but still being fun and i enjoy playing it Do i recommend it  Yes if u don t mind wait till they make the servers great and optimize the game buy it meanwhile you practice and have fun  
very good game  D
Szerintem nagyon j de nha nekem a hzak bebuggolnakDe ez csak lehet hogy attlvan hogy szr a netem de attl mindenesetre kivl a legjoob jtk
Clunky rubbish of a FPS
i cant get a kill1010
Spend 40 minutes looting get shot by somone who hasn t moved since they spawned 1010Cannot reccomend in current state map is too big for the game mode have fun holding shift  w or setting up keybindings Oh and while you re doing your key bindings you might as well download a reshading tool so you can actually see and play the game without lag spikes but after all that you re still gonna die to someone who hasn t moved in 45 minutes
I really can enjoy 1 out of 4 rounds at this stage  cheating is so rampant with aim automatically snapping to the target  even being shot down without the aim being on youI hope the devs can find a solution to this problem before it kills this game
Horrible experience as of late First of all it s a sniper heaven  dropping to a zone without one and you re doomed Secondly the latest patch turned it into a running simulator Gotta be moving constantly Don t have a vehicle  Exit to main menu
Need a lot of Ram otherwise risk having the buildings not loading for the first five minutes of the game
This game is certainly worth your money people Even at earlly access simply amazing graphics and game mechanics and the studio keeps updating the game alot and i love it The hype is just real not like close quater COD and large scale battlefield It sits differerntits battle royale
This is awesome game fun to play especialy if you play with friends but theres so many problems with this game that make it bad same time If you think cs go haves hltty servers then you havent seen pubg servers System requirements are really bigger than it says  If you kill streamer you get banned hit performance Game freezes If you try to drive your vehicle might randomly explode kill you and loose the game when 10 alive If you drive motorcyle you might fall into the map or trough bridge If you try to drive 2 seated motorcycle it randomly might flip over and kill you with no reason Even you have good setup buildings might not render They have ads in chinese servers IN LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING GAME THAT COST 30 Sounds are fucked Graphics are fucked Might throw you into asian server The whole game is fuckedPLEASE FIX THIS GAME SO ITS PLAYABLE
Pleas give more game mode 
I GOT A REFUNDone of only three games i ve asked for a refund on first to get my money backLet s be honest it s an ARMA 3 game mode that got picked up for independent development and now lives on an unreal engine how is that worth 30  5 8 is all I m willing to part with for what is on offer here  But hey to each their own maybe you ll like it
I really love it Get it now  If your pc can take it lol
Prosgreat gameplaygreat graphicscons even for an early access game the number of times I have been shot through a wall is rediculous Don t even get me started on the ban policy I wouldn t complain about this if this game hadn t been out for so long and still have so many bugs the update and bug fix cycle for this game are LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing atrocius But the worst part is the toxic comunity I mean really wtf its basically call of duty at this point bunch of faget 12 year olds screaming how they want to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  your mom
Still needs work hope they continue to improve it Would recommend
            
BEST GAME EVER  D  D  D  3  3  3
Jump try to get a gun die and go back to the lobby
The game is extremely fun in my opinion That being said I believe it has major flaws that could easily be address but some have only been made worse1 Map RNG   I feel the game time should stay the same have circle start to move sooner but actually move slower This way if you do not find a car or if cirle dicked you you are not punished  shouldn t change game pace just has more death via combat2 Loot RNG   I didn t really have any issues with this until they made loot less common a few months back It was night and day when it happened Rare items were still rare pre update but it caused the early game no weapon issue to become and actual issue 3 Slow updates  Bugs   It feels like the dev team still pushes updates at the same rate I would think a game with 2 million  players would have hired many more staff and we would see rapid bug fixes as well as more new features4 Red Zone   Poorly implemented currently plenty of better ways to do it online
The bluezone change makes this game feel like call of duty
Ridiculous how this game holds on to all kinds of bugs even after release
The best game since Battlefield 2
it is a great game if you have friends to play with but it needs a lot of optimization and if you play solos and you are not a youtuber you will get bored after 100 hours 6510
very goods gameplay but bluehole developers if you friends read that they you needed fix network lag detected i all time playing im in plane i release parachute and i fly on sky i got much lags pls bluehole developers fix that thanks
it s very good
Best game of the world
the server is so bad and there s no fpp at sea
so many player cheat    and Network delay 
unge jag har cancer
Ok ok this game is overall AMAZINGMainly you just try and find a gun before someone hits you with a pan I have been playing this game ever since I got it but it does have a few cons  One problem is performance issues I dont have those YouTuber or twitch computers but for me its powerful and can run games really well but then this has to run almost every low to get a smooth 50 60 FPS And jumping out of a building while shooting NEEDS TO BE FIXED because the amount of time i swear i saw god himself wasnt actually then getting killed really stupidly But since this is my first batlle royal game and I know they keep updating the game so it keeps me entertained Overall amazing game not going to lie LOLOh and for all the people who think this is fortnight no just not Way more realistic In graphics not so much like getting killed by a flying guy LOL
1010 although its overpricedPerfect simulation of Detroit Area
This company blows LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing balls Just wait until a REAL company comes along to make a game like this properly 20 Hz servers in 2017 get the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  outta here lmao
quality a littly buggy and hard to run but still quality
bugIf the gaming experience still like this especially the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server with LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  cheaters everywhere I think you are gonna lose a whole bunch of players I m serious you are losing me nowAnd now waiting for at least a month  you are telling me you are updating the leadboard   In what hell will leadboard important than bugs  
Woeful GameGets boring after five rounds of the same gameplayThe servers are nothing more than potatoesIngame AdvertsServers are getting worseOh and dont honk the horn of a Car You ll get bannedDon t Kill a streamer You ll get bannedDont Try and get Close you ll get lagged around or your bullets will go through them
Bluehole is a pathetic and their devs aswell you can get banned from anything and you have to follow their  morale code  which is really weird they are really bias and looks like the game is not moving forward at all the reason people by it now its because  everybody  else is playing it but thats not true they are killing their own game even tho they have more players than ever fps drops bad servers ALOT of bugs and now they try to make more money by selling crates even tho you have already payd full prize for a early access game that in my opinion is not ready and should be in beta but hey  its Espots ready  love the way games and the trend of cosmetics skins and early access games that are full of bugs have become the new trends of games it makes me dred the future of gaming
Long story short Spent 25 min looking for gear  died picking pan up  D 57 
Wow I don t think I ve played a game with such story driven excellence like this one This beautiful PvE solo game is full of surprises and fun little jokes Even on a real bad day just a few minutes of riding a horse or completing one of the deep sidequests can cheer me up even on the day that my wife miscarried I absolutely recommend this polished stunning lighthearted little joy to anyone who likes such games as The Legend of Zelda  Breath of the Wild Mariokart and especially Minecraft Very nice
VERY GOOD FOR THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Great game looking and becoming better every update another map about to come out increasingly good fps 2MIL playerbase Active devs  what more can you want from a game
Bad game Go play Fortnite
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing retard gamepls fix this net work lag detectedafter update 19GB my game always crashstupid making money company
Cant recommend it because it is unoptimised as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  even at very low settings the game suffers from drops in frame rates
The game clearly needs more work I cant be too harsh because it is in early access but still some of the things in this game can not be ignored     Pros  The menu system is kind of coolThe start of every match is kind of coolCons The game can become unplayable just from changing a few graphics settings The game is a carbon copy of h1z1The crate system is stupidAll the  American  servers have terrible ping no matter whatThe rendering just did not want to work even after multiple resets I hope this helped some of you who were thinking of buying the game
   1     9          
The game wont loasd for me is is just always stuck on the loading screen
Best battle royale ever 11bugs10
brigde campers made me kill myself
games had me hooked since the beginning enough said
bad performance crashes quite often and if you kill a streamer you get banned
Great game but it could be better1 Improve jump animation  It should be instead a jump overIt sucks trying to escape from a fight   getting killed basically cuz  wall s fault2 Improve sanctions for cheating users3 Car bugs just car bugs710
I love this game to bits It s every bit tense as it is fun However the amount of times this game freezes at crucial moments or the amount of times you get server wide network lag is infuriating And this isn t even talking about the myriad of bugs and optimization issues I know I haven t played for too long but it s already to the point where I want to never touch this game again It s just that bad
The concept of the game itself is awsome but the whole non optimized in game LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ruins the fun I do not recommend this game to anyone due to it s unpredicted working will just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  you off Yes you can say it s non released yet but everyone knows it wont be much better in the close future 210 trash
There are lot of playerslittle serverbad optimizeBluehole company never care about players they just want moneylike courtesan
Why dont you guys fix the fukking game and add what you guys said you were going to add instead of adding crates and skins DUMB A S
why would ths game use so many rammy gpu and cpu gonna blow but i got 1 to 45 fpsis this game better than Dragon Ages Inquisitor cause i can play  DAI 60fps fulltime
Can you focus on optimisation before adding new content and stuff  I mean it s Early Access and stuff but the stuttering and lagging in game is just ridiculous
231 hours played 90  of it spent leaving to lobby cause someone dc 1010 buy this gameShould rename this to bug gcome back to playing bug g after 2 weeks all 3 games killed by hackers Claptried to sue kids game btw losing to kids game btw pubg btw 12 btw haHAA

One of the best games I have been played no doubt about that
my diaper is fuill bad game          
This game is riding on the success created by the fact that it was  first  in something   realistic  battle royale shooter Want to be  good   high on the leaderboards at this game then expect to camp in a bush in the middle of an open field for 10 15 minutes every game It really is a camping simulator Aim duels rarely happen and whoever spots the enemy first will prevail  if he is not terrible at aimingSure you can go berserk and land in the popular areas But for what  For a much worse battlefieldcod fights With a 2 3 minute respawn timer Game is SO BADLY OPTIMIZED too I m still having loads of lags with a 2000 gaming pcDevelopers have also shown more interest in creating new badly implemented features rather than fix the existing ones
This is a good game the rules is very interestingI like itBut cheat LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s are everywhereyou can find cheats almost in every gameAlthough BlueHole claimed to seal a lot of cheat accountsbut there are still many cheatersand I found that cheating software claims 100  will not be foundSo I guess that s itPUBG is just another game that was destroyed by cheats
Can t recommend this game untill its optimased Eats more than half of your ram and cpu Buildings doesn t load on start Lots of bugs and so on Frame freezes on shootings The good thing is you can waste some time running and looting for no reason cuz u die because u don t have gtx1080
this is a very fun game in my opinion  I love open world shooters maybe they could add a sandbox 
Lots of potential but wouldn t buy it210 waste of my money and time
You devs are so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing dumb why add emotes and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  if your not going to region lock china you can t even use them without being killed by a cat eating piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  get a working anticheat and region lock before adding more gay LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  like emotes You are loosing players to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing fortnite and im starting to play it cause it feels good to have some english team mates and no chinese hackers
Recent Changes From The Test ServerMassive changes have been mad eto PUBG and now I can run it on Ultra with GTX1060 with 16 gigabytes of ram smoothly on 60 fps Great game but the blue still does surprising alot of damage It needs a slight nerfMy Views On Players  I found out that atleast 1 in 20 games that you will be playing against a person who has toggled  cheated  People are generally really nice but occasionally you get people who are absolute pain in the back Not toxic but if you play a squad match with them and they die they will usually say something narsty towards you before they leave Few players have accidently team killed me a few times but on an occasion there were groups of people killing me one purpose simply because I have better loot than them Rarely I found players teaming upGame  I realised that sometimes the game gets very laggy when many people drop into a specific place Sometimes you cannot pickup some on the items due to server lag Many times  I have crashed and relaunched back into the game Manytimes  There would be connection problems where I would have to fully close the game and relog back in Runs smoothly most the time Gets very intense and fun as more and more people die Blue does overwhelmingly alot of damage towards the player sometimes AK 47 needs a slight nerf as it can easily penetrate level 123 body armour
Funny how some people down vote what could be possibly the best game in the past 10 years I started to play this game around April 2017 when it was still completely full of bugs But after a couple of rounds I thought WOW this game can be incredibly fun  More fun in fact than any other game I own currently  At first bugs were annoying but the concept was brilliant and even the broken driving and bouncing around was more fun than annoying  for me at leastThere are 2 main concepts that make this game start off interesting 1 100 players in every game create a consistent experience without having to wait for more than a minute A 100 is a lot not many games have 100 players on the map trying to use anything to survive There are no friendlies here other than you squad mates2 Large play area and contracting  battle royale circle guarantees that you will see action pretty soon  unlike in other many gamesThese two things and the rapid improvements that were made to the game over the past 6 months made it incredibly popularWith regards to the down votes most of them are from people that had a bad server experience  yes it is early access with smash hit growth I wish server issues would be resolved and my region South Africa really With regards to people complaining about having to pay for some items I say so what  I played 400 hours when I got a a crate with a gray jacket which I sold for the the price of the game on steam for steam credit Awesome got the game for free basically Paid for  items don t seem to help you in game  Not like you buying a ghillie suit you are buying a silly skirt or jacket that actually makes it harder to see if you are wearing a vest already  It is mostly cosmeticLast thing I have dozens of friends that own this game on steam and not one got banned Read the  Terms  in the game If you don t team kill hack or otherwise being a troll and you should be OKLastly the competitive side of PUBG is taking off with bang stealing many players from other online competitive titlesMuch recommended but you need some regular friends to play with to make the most of it
Played around 4 hours after purchase then got banned Is it was a good will to let me play 4 hours to not let me redeem my money No recommend to everyone
Until when is this game early access  This game began to get a negative response by the players
This was a tough review to write as the game is incredibly addicting but has so many aspects of the game that just feel off or unpolished Even though this is a game labelled as Early Access and is doing great in sales there are many things that the team should be prioritizing So far the early access cycle for me has been akin to that of ARK s it s been very fun fun enough to overlook the current negatives However the more I play it like with ARK I begin to tire of the countless issues the game has and that the dev team seems to avoid dealing with The large problems with the game are the way the servers are handling traffic and client side problems With these two problems there is a lot of lag and problems as hit detection is purely client side which can cause a lot of problems with things such as Desync Another problem with the game is what seems like PR defensiveness about their game This is shown from having issues with Fortnite having a Battle Royale game mode and the fact that they advertise in their game to Chinese players because they don t want to have servers in China so they advertise for a proxy service If you are able to get past all the rather serious issues  most of which are not listed and not get into a game with a Hacker or Streamer  Stream sniping is extremely over reported for then by all means buy the game but in its current state I cannot personally say I think it s worth the 3699 CAD the game costs with the state of optimization and connection quality
                     x   dosss i   
hey guys make sure you check out my channel CheekyDoe some great gameplay and amazing banter https wwwyoutubecomchannelUCtXD_NY5sxXlpDAhW 4xQ8w view_assubscriber
This game is a very fun game it s very intense but fun All I can say is this game is fun but you need a decent pc if you dont want to go into an internet cafe everytime you want to play
     1200        100 1010
Don t kill a streamer or you will get banned
Fortnite is better the graphic in PubG is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Waaaaay to buggyBetter now though
What a fornominon this isThe whole idea of  battle royal  isn t at all a recent consept It has been around for a very long time But in a gaming sence this is the one game that has personified it In the best ways possible We need to give credit to Arma DayZ and Rust to getting near the consept But when it comes to battle royal this beats them all hands down In terms of game playThe combat is fantastic NOBODY GETS WEAPONS AT THE START You all find them during the game Thus ensuring a chance for even new players to trump the vetsThe enviroment is vast and if you get stuck on the other side of the island as the death circle is on the other Pray to God you manage to find a veacleThe shooting is clunky which is good This makes cheap shots realy hard to pull off BUT BE WARNED Hackers are present in the game  I have personaly encountered twothat is pathetic to say it s a for fun gameThe only draw back is that this game WILL be moniteriesed by the accursed  LOOT CREATS  systemthat just sickens me Because they made the game to not spawn you in with weapons To compensate they make loot creats incredably hard to get It works like this1st crate  700 points2nd crate  1400 points3rd crate   2800 pointsand so on Until the next week it resets the pointsThat is shady as hell PUBGTo end this review I like this game to play casualy But for anyone out therePLEASE DO NOT BUY THE CRATES WITH REAL MONEY
Terrible combat Armor means nothings Bye bye PUBG Just waiting for Destiny 2
iliked
the Game that actually is worth the cost
This Game Is Based Upon Your Playing StyleWhich Means U Can Either GO Loud Or Be StealthyAnd For Those People Who Gave A Negative Review I Just Want TO  Say That If U Can t Win Then Dont CryIt Takes Time To Master Pubg
eZ
This game is so awesome but there is some bug in the game and the graphic was very realistic also you can use fps first person perspective mode or third person perspective mode but i recommending to use fps mode because its way easy to play and we are already used to fps mode try this game it s worth it
To be Honest I dont realy get why this game is getting alot of hateSince I bought this game  Not long ago The game constantly keept on updatingfixing bugsadding new weaponsMaps and moreI belive people realy should buy this game as its realy funrealy addicting and super fun with friends The Game Adds New  Modes  almost weekly for a short ammount of time The Developers Keep on fixing bugs everytime one appears The Game Is FunSometimes fast pace sometimes slow pace but as a whole is fun as hell
BEST GAME EVER This game is so much fun and every match is packed with action even if you lose you still want to go in for another match  the gunplay is smooth and works well driving is good but could improve definetly worth the money there are some bugs but it is early access and there are some bugs but what do you expect buying an early access game the gamemode is so much fun and creates suspense definetly recomend the game to any gamer out there either competitive or casual Thank you for taking some of your time and reading my reveiw I really appreciate it
really bad game not recommend that hate that game
If you live anywhere under OCE servers and don t want to play duos then you are paying the same amount for half the content that other regions get  assuming that you don t want to connect to servers with 200 ping in completely different countries for a shooter No first person mode simply because they don t want to pay for the servers is just a joke
I really want to like this game but I can t Maybe because it is early access and there are still some balancing issues but it really makes me stop and think why this has gone this far Don t get me wrong  It is a fun game and I ll probably continue playing it but I just can t get behind it Poorly optomized sound is still LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed spawns for some reason have gotten worse  because for some reason when in duos I go into 6 different houses and get stuck with a pistol and level 3 equipment Or when I go into schoolmilitary base I got into many roomsplaces and find nothing good and someone comes around the corner with a mini 1 shotting meI could go on and say I am bad  i really am bad but they way some people shoot me does not make sense at all
So this game has been in early access since march It has great potential but when you find yourself lossing matches becuase of server instability or network lag you have a problem and it needs fixed asap before more players become enraged and leave for something similiar and free just saying In the current state of the game I would recomend the game to friends however if the problems persist for much longer I m jumping ship Don t do what ARK did and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  everyone off bluehole
This game is not bad but some things need to be changed about the bans1  Streamer exploit bugs and dont get banned2  Guy on the stream use same bug and streamer report and the guy get bannedThese devs are abusing to much they need to stop and catch cheaters
Don t be swayed by the 10 release this game is still early access It was only released for the holiday season to make more money It took me over 40 mins to find a game in OC some days i cant even play on OC servers but my friends can Game is a piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Getting shot without knowing where it came from and die instantly works everytime 1010
Ridiculously broken game don t even bother with your time Go back to the drawing board Bluehole There is not one thing that works well in this game besides the concept which is unoriginal Just then playing a game few players alive  Network Lag Detected  pops up on my screen and renders my control completly inoperable Meanwhile an enemy player is running up behind me with a shotgun i can hear their footsteps and gameplay clearly and i am not lagging as my squad mate is spectating me and communicating with me in realtime Boom Shot to the back of the head while i am still stuck with  Network Lag Detected  screen at the most crucial time Game is now over What a joke Had a poor experience throughout the whole game and we were not on a foreign server Look at Epic Games i know its their game engine but Fortnite destroys this in performance
Good and interesting idea with ton of bugs bad servers and bad mechanics
cant get into match dont get it
Having played Fortnite for a while I needed something more  My kids have been playing this a lot lately so I took the plunge and bought PUBG  And I m not disappointed  It s a bit reminiscent of  The game formally known as WarZ    only better  The vehicles work you can generally tell if someone is around  open doors missing loot and cover from trees bushes fences etc  The thing that I like the most having played Fortnite first is it takes away the  Cartoony  aspect of the game  The first time a sniper fired at me   and missed   scared the crap out of me  The sound is quite atmospheric  Shots echo in the distance the C 130 overhead sounds authentic and bullet stikes and misses put the fear into you  To all the sooks getting ads in their lobby   maybe if you turned off your mike and stopped being such a tool online people would care   but until then suck it up princess   it s only the lobby
Server issues microtransactions when they said they wouldn t less focus on development vs profit focus creator himself is a sensitive one  kick in the chest reference and don t even get me started on what the developers do to suck up to streamers  you get banned automatically if a streamer reports you etc etcThis is an Early Access Game that had a massive potential and is good but due to the developers handling of almost everything deserves a negative review until their trends change In a big way
this game is falling apart they will kill it once and for all with microtransactionsthey kiss the streamers butts they could do no wrongsmhits a shame could have been a classic still not properly optimized
Pros Driving is funCons Exlusive server hosting to only VIP playersOnly 1 playable map whats taking them so longCustumes are boring and some are at aridiculous priceFriendly fire is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  i ve gotten killed by team serveral times to steal my lootCant mute certain members in the teamI rate this game 310
blast
Hackers Everywhere get cross map one tapped by a P1911 or a crossbow is such a casual event in this game Loot spawns are irregular This game is for people that just want to TILT Cancer is the aim of the game
I d rather buy win rar
Rules of the Royale China 1Use cookware to cover your LOVE LOVE LOVE When in doubt scream and poutDrop base or you a lil LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Keep a 5 meter spread so you don t look gay
was good too many hackers and can t report because their is always an  error occurred 
SImple rule stay alive proper team communication  be alert all the time this game keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time first i thought what a simple game but after spending couple of hours i am in love with this game good work devs
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner 
Broken game The worst optimization
The best words to describe this game are Intense and Addictive
This game used to be fun and then it blew up to a point where there servers can t handle the load anymore if they ever could in the first place  Lag spikes are common and I know it s not my internet since it will happen across the game and desync issus are just part of the experience now  To make things worse the game is so poorly optimized my severely OC d 1070 will max at 55FPS and it s been this way since day 1Hackersaimbots are common more so now than a month ago  From what I ve heard through the grapevine someone released a free one somewhere and it s completely destroyed gameplay overall  I know I m not the best but seeing some asshat rack up headshot after headshot in the kill feed with the most inaccurate gun in the game tends to be kind of telling  On the flip side there are also people out there doing something to reduceeliminate damage received since I ve lit up more than a few people with full magazines only to have them turn around and 1 shot me from full health and full level 3 armor with a pistol  Reporting does nothing since Bluehole has comeout and said they just compile reporting stats for records and not necessarily actionTo top it off there some questionable company practices regarding actually banning people  At the moment the only people who get banned are  stream snipers  otherwise known as  anyone who kills a streamer in a bad mood   This hasn t happened to me and at this point IDGAF if it actually does but the only complaints the company seems to take seriously are the ones from streamersTL DR Pass on this game until there is a massive server upgrade and they actually start cracking down on cheaters that aren t  stream snipers 
So the game is now out of Early Access but they still seem to be developing it The game has A LOT of bugs and the updates while fixing some bugs always seem to introduce more at the same timeThe netcode for this game is terrible it really needs something better put in place or better servers whateverAlso the hacker issue is getting extremely annoying EVERY game I ve played tonight I have been traced through walls before getting shot or killed THROUGH A LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING HILL OR BUILDING Extremely frustrating and not a fun gaming experience at the momentWould not recommend until they get this under controlPS   Region lock China from Oceanic this is getting beyond a joke
The concept of this game is pretty cool but I really don t see the fascination in this game it s really clunky everything movement wise is terrible the hand to hand combat is a joke how this game has nearly 2 million concurrent players is a miracle this games movement plays like dayz need I say more  If you want a clunky game that feels worse than anything else you can buy then be my guest but with how many copies of this game sold you would think they would have the money to fix how clunky this game is at everything or hell even completely change the engine but no adding another town is just as good
I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND IT ALWAYS STUCK IN A LOADING SCREEN EVERYTIME I MATCHMAKING
I think this game is pretty gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Fun while it lasted Sadly it seems the developers are not interested in adding any more content or fixing any bugs  The only thing I ve seen added is more cash making opportunities for the devsEDIT  I ve seen more bugs introduced actually impressive
I know that this game has poor optimization server issues and tons of problems But for me this game is really fun to play casually especially when I play it with friends If you want to play casually and seeking for thrilling fun this game is for you
From my experience untill now i didn t met a important problem laggy serverscheaters etc with this gamethe  only thing they  have to do is to optimizate the game more and add more stuff into Soi give  a 810
i buy this game 3 days ago and i play like a 2 days they have optim problem we all know that but this is day 3 and im trying to play but when matching is complete i stuck in the waiting screen and i can hear my character is swimming or falling and this start happening today after i do the update but what the actual f bluehole  i pay for this game and even my computer can handle it  i cant play it please fix this problem
Been having mouse problems ever since I bought the game Followed DPI guides even FPS guides and it doesn t even better the experience Also me and 10 other people got killed by a hacker within 10 seconds as he head shots ALL of us with an UMP
They gave us 64 tick servers
So much lag and so many hackers in the game
Multi million dollars revenue paired with multi million issues caused by  players and devs alike
still maintenance im from philippines
Unplayable   textures that can kill you  motorbikes are  bad word that steam will change into hearts  everything is bad
                                          30         and                                               
Sucks game   
Funny game but needs a lot of improvements yet
very fun with people theres discord groups where you can find friends to play with
Good Concept Period 1 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up server2 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up graphics3 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up optimizationWanna blame in on the engine  Fortnite was also made on unreal engine and they juz proved that their baby game is still more smooth and lag free compared to this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I was just wondering How LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of programmers are u guys  My PC is giving me 100 120 fps in this game while it could provide me a solid 120 games such as Far Cry 4 It dont LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  make sense how this piece of junk is more graphically demanding than a beautiful game like Far Cry Maybe you guys should consider hiring talented people cause the current cheap team you have imo is dragging everthing down
Alright people finally need to understand that it clearly says  EARLY ACCESS  This means that things in the game are not finished First off people have trouble with servers Now if you were a game developer and made a game you wouldn t think the game would become the most popular game on steam of almost all time  Servers arn t exactly easy to run especially with 100 people connected to one game with 19 million at most Also people are having issues with their performance There are plenty of tutorials to help improve performance online but it is still early access Again trying to get 100 people in a 8x8 km map isn t easy to optimize for all systems The develpers are aware of server issues and optimization issues and most likely they will be fixed by the time the game actually is fully releasedIf you are looking for a game to get laughs out of with your friends and mess around and have the chance to win a mass survival game PUBG is the game for you Remember it is EARLY ACCESS
this game is godly The optimization  is amazing  
After a parachuting trip goes sideways people go mad and run at eachother with pans half naked and screaming their lungs offCan get bit exciting at times
PUBG is best enjoyed with 3 friends in squad mode it s a great time if you have squadmates who will communicate with each other and work together Solo on the other hand is not quite as much fun and is where the game falls short the most Haven t experienced too many glitches only a few of which could ruin a match Overall it s an intense game that is a blast with a group of friends Worth a buy if you like squad based shooters
No idea what all the hype is for  Janky laggy gunplay is mediocre genre is stale game is poorly optimized servers are trash
Worst decision ever don t know why I still play but I would not buy this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t again
Worthed every penny There are some problems and bugs but it s an early access game you must expect this kind of malfunctions Just be patient and wait for updates and stable release
The hitbox is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  in this game 
What the hell Bluehole fix the god damn game stop being dumbasses
After 5 hours I m bored of this gameRepetitive  DullNothing really to strive forMaybe when this game exits Early Access and builds upon the foundation it has established as of the posting of this review I ll give it another chanceUntil then  I feel there are much better games out there to spend my time  with610  give it another year and see where it is at then
GREAT GAMEA lot of people hate on this game for it being difficult I say GIT GUD This game is really easy to play if you start to invest more and more time into it Like within my first 20 hours of playing this game I had won a solo game and gotten top 5 in atleast 8 10 other games Its not difficult you re just really bad
It is no because it didn t works normaly don t buy this if you are fast angry
Wow after playing only few hours of this game i can say i get why many love this game Its a mixture of single player solo mode  multiplayer 50 players You can take on other players or sneak and stay alive to to kill last remaning player or can play Co Op mode and take on others But the mode i liked is SOLO Becoz you can do whatever the heck you want and no one willcan give you ancedote about it Go on your own adventure be the winner by staying alive and outsmarting 100 players
Good game Got some chicken in  ma belli  a few times haha Obiviously there are a few minor bugs etc and problems for which have been highlighted by others The only thing that has kind of annoyed me recently is the game has become laggy   Now as a foreigner living abroad I usually get no lag from the asian server and some minor lag on the other servers which is to be expected However for some reason the asian server is lagging to the point the game is unplayable now My internet it fine and was playing for months with no  asian server  lag Oh and then I noticed that they are selling some software to make the game faster    So like you buy a game play it like it then you slow it down  Try sell me software so it runs properly   I checked it out today and the advertisment for that software which is usually found in the lobby wasnt there  not sure if it was just that time and didnt load but either way the game is lagging and im a bit disappointed to be honest Anyway to summarize   GOOD GAME  WORTH BUYING  Lagging  In game advertisments I will recommend the game for the time being but if the latency lagging and selling proxy software doesn t change then I will have to not recommend this game
positive game but with low fps
Another overhypped and totally crap game I have no idea why it has so many players online  Asians  It s extremely frustrating full of bugs and glitches it has terrible optimalisation for such a medicore graphics it s full of cheaters and griefers it s better to turn off VOIP unless you want to hear to screaming teenagers It s not a survival game   it s run and gun game which with every minute of the match turns into walking and camping simulator It doesn t have any learning curve and it s totally random   you won t get better with every minute spended in this game   it s all about luck Perfect game for bad players and casual gamers Ps I couldn t aim down sight in this game without having double click right mouse button in first person perspective I heard it s an occasional bug and there is no fix for it and that said it was a nail to the coffin   I ve uninstalled PUGB after 10h playtime and I regret spending 30 on it   if I could I would melt it or giveaway this excuse for a game
awsome game
Yes there are problems with hackers yes the servers are dodgy and yes it isn t exactly optimised BUT all of these points that a lot of people love to point out pale in comparason to the amazing moments I ve had playing this game There are issues I cant deny that but holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  I love this game I would recomend if you have a decent PC 610  would be an 8 or so if it gets fixed
many many fixes needed i cant wait for the full release
very good game but some drops its hapining
Update  Much better performance although I seem to always get unrendered houses at first which makes me lose all early battles Network is less laggy as well but still noticeably laggy    Keeps crashing Unplayable
Reviews are to busy at the moment Please try again later
Could play the game for 170 hours with no issues what so ever but randomly started to crash when loading into game Tried every fix online and tried to get a hold of support for 2 weeks but to no avail Congratulations PUBG you successfully LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed me out of 30 dollars
Greedy People Turned this game into complete crap
Cheater everywhere in mid high rank you will suddenly get killed by those 60 KD ratio players on leaderboards Every single bullet they hit you any distance any situationGame itself is not developed too no textquick chat no range finder etc This game is from Arma 3 s mod and cannot beat original at all Such Arma 2 Dayz mod is 100 times better than DayZ SA
worst game I ve ever bought on steam
The most exciting game i ve ever played It s like you are playing in Hunger Games
esport ready
Really fun when lil LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s camp on roofs and in bathrooms and win like that i rate it 911
IMA GAY
The game is a great experience Yeah you find the occasional cheaters and the server drops out alot but the devs are working hard to fix the game other then these issues I d say its a well rounded game that deserves its popularityAlthough jumping is a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Great addictive game although unoptamisted
its a nice game if you play with your friends you can a lot of fun but fps drops makes it hard to play
An absolutley amazing game The thrill of getting the final three kills in solo defeating 96 other people with a squad or beating everyone up with a dynamic duo  this game is an excellent peice of art
Recently upgraded my pc so I could play this game in higher fps but it turned out that it wasn t really my pc s problem fps is still low and drop whenever it can while disconnecting me from the game and not allowing me to rejoin which is just really irritating   
This game is 1010 IGN better than H1Z1
Great Fun  D
5 min PvP after you land15 min of running around untill the endgame  unless you bump into someone who has the patience to sit in one spot for 15 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  minutes waiting for someone who s bored to death to walk by
This game at the current state is fun until you realize that the repetitiveness LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE t that comes along with it hits you at the 200 hour mark The development of this game is hopefully going to keep on going but wait atleast until it gets better I have a gtx 960 and run this game on medium but still drop to like 40 50 fps The optimization needs to be worked on but no they add a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE  mini14 which shoots like a sniper I dont write reviews but I think it was important to tell others wait and dont waste your money
DO NOT BUYBought the game as friend was bored and wanted to coop We are no longer friendsGame is full of glitches that are not being fixedOptimization is non existentGraphics make your eyes bleed because of weird contrasting looks like it s from plasticine in nurserypoor selection of weapons some have been added but this should be a matter of timeOver few months I haven t seen this game to really go forwardI will never understand the phenomena of Early Access Battle Royale games Most of peeps either rambo or camp there is no middle
The game is fun yes The game is made well yes Although the game is really hard to get up and running Let me elaborate A few of my friends and i have the game and out of all of us one cannot get his game to start and the rest of us after one game get a closed connection I do not know if this has been fixed in the recent update I hope it has Nevertheless i recommend buying this game it is fun Gl hf
What a Game This Game is Packed with Fun even if you dont think its for you  You Need to Try Playerunknown sBattleGrounds  ive got 219 Hours on this Game Around 60 hours in the past week or 2 While this game is Hard to Run they currently are fixing it this game may have a hacker pop up every so often but always report them watch the death cam first tho  Pubg is that game that gets me thinking tatical about a shooter EVERY move will change your game This is a Master Piece in Game Design apart from Flipping your bike and Dying from Falling TRY Pubg if you havent you hear every fortnite fan rating that bad game better than this dont listen to that PUBG is a GREAT Game Try It
This game is extremely fun Dont listen to all the salty players that are upset that they and 30 other people go to school or military base and they die
Optimize  NopeBugs  alot of themanti Cheat  nah its fucked up BlueHole You are just fucking your game and your players after any updates this is was a fun game and still is  but you guys just Ruin it Make it right Before you guys lose your players
Development appears to have slowed down to a crawl and despite a fun start the bugs lags and clunkiness of it all have become too much Wait until release
I have been playing this game intensely for the last couple of months pretty intensely and sofar it has been an incredibly awesome experience alone and even more in a squad with friends Of course realizing that this is still an early access title there have been some minor game crashesglitches etc but personally never on a level that I found it a bother in anyway or that it was even encraching on my game experience as a whole Good wholesome battle royale fun for the boys and girls a broad variety of different guns and items to loot sometimes challenging terrain and that oh so wonderful rush because of which we all play the game that hits when claiming that poultry The updates and patches kept coming although now less regular and I really  felt  the game progressively getting better as I hope it will when vaulting and new maps get introduced and players can kiss the days of glitch jumping out of windows goodbye But The last couple of days the game has become completely unplayable Yes server issues yes we know they know everybody knows It has been almost a week and I have never been so utterly frustrated with a video game No less a video game that I have been playing at least 40 hours a week for the last couple of months The literal last three games I tried to join I didnt even make it to the pre game squadding is a new kind of russian roulette and the amount of times I have gotten looted up and into position to start playing the game and then have the host close the connection was maybe funny at first but has somewhat lost its charm now To a point where I have to force myself to even try playing I love Playerunkown s Battlegrounds and I am excited to see what the future holds As for now I ll occupy myself with something else until Bluehole has actually managed to fix this beautiful mess So future buyers beware  Just wait a little longer it will be worth it   maybe there is even a steam sale on the horizon 
This is my first review of a game I have been playing games all my life but just decided to start reviewing them So to get to the point PUBG is an amazing game in the matter that it is fun and can also be competitive If you are playing with friends it will be great fun and also a lot of laughs If you prefer playing solo you will still have a lot of fun and to be honest solo queue is more interesting in the matter that people tend to die faster and the tension builds faster Now of course there are a couple of downsides about the game That would be the POOOOOOOOOOOOOR optimization  I personally am not suffering from it that much  because of my hardware I hope that on release they will optimize the game and will make it run consistent with no FPS drops etc The game does look amazing graphically on Ultra but when its on low it does look quite bad The 2nd downfall of the game is the streaming crybaby community If you by some rare chance accidentally kill some of them you might get perma ban just because you killed the wrong guy As a developer myself I would say that this is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  but it s not my decision to make So in the end I would still recommend the game as it is interesting to play the gameplay is interesting  you never know where that sniper and 8x scope drops will be and the community is always fun to listen to if you fancy that  beware the toxicity and troll levels are high but thats in every game and that is what makes it fun Overall from the promised updates the game seems to be getting better so I would rate 810 just because it is still in early access and is suffering from the issues mentioned above I hope this review was helpful and will help you decide more easily PS the thing about getting banned because some streamer is a crybaby is very low and many people just boycotted the game reviews just because of that so the game is indeed nice and fun as long as you don t have the bad luck of getting in a match with a sh tty streamer and by some miracle having the luck to kill him
 Launches game Clicks  Play  Gets stuck in a plane full of people shouting  I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed your mom in Pecado  Lands somewhere Kills someone Thinks he is going to win because he managed it to top 10 Kill a few more people Gets shot by an AWM fro
Come on we need a Survivor mode
Alright so This game isn t that bad gameplay wise BUT there are things which are ruining the experienceIts really fun to play with friends and all but the weird physics and bugs make it really annoying to play
march 2018 still more hack map and aim bot
For the love of god do not buy this game Do not support this horrible buisness practice of charging 40 to beta test a buggy busted game  They have absolutly no plans to ever finish this game you can look at DayZ and H1Z1 for evidence  This guy worked on both of those games and look where theyre at  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
Extremely buggy unfinished game
great game for solo and for friends but it is still in early access so it will get better
All of the top 10 players in NA serve are Chinese hackers Shame on meIf you guys were killed by name  WG Qun QQ or KJ etc   remember to report them These people are always on the top 10 list and bluehole just igorne them
I try to avoid Early Access games they too often end up never getting finished And that s certasinly possible for this one as well And perhaps the price is a bit steep 30 might be a bit much for one map godawful hack prevention and the occasional lag But overall I m happy with PUBG so far and I certainly hope they continue to develop the game
Good game so far and shows a lot of promises But bluehole need to work much harder to fix a bad performance optimization
FIX YOUR LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  BLUEHOLE
Really Like it excellent strategy game to share with friends
       LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
This game is good but game s optimization is very bad on low system pc s  
This game may have a huge following and every streamer plays it 247 but tbh this is a game where you spend 90   of your time running around piking stuff up and interacting with nobody whilst feeling no fear worry or rush the only time the game is intense is when your in the last 5 and the area is small but that only happens to 5  of players each game the way to win is hiding untill the end and trying to have fun will get you killed quicklyNot to mention the voice chat is horrible and the loot box system in early accses is BS follwed by only having 1 map and half of the textures are incomplete even on a I7 4790k and GTX  1070 with 16GB ram on a SSD this game stutters all the time with low fpsIf you want battle royale i couldn t recommend fortnite more especially considering that its FREE and is a finshed product
 Be me Never win Get lucky win with 1 kill Start playing aggressive af Get wins with upwards of 10kills________________________Lesson of the day  Play aggressive af1010 Will keep playingThese days I feel like a team is almost necessary to have the most fun
Fun addicting game I ve been waiting for a walking simulator for years and now they made one They put in scavaging in the mix as well
This game is really buggy bad servers with lots of rubber banding recoil on holo sight is almost nothing then put it on red dot and its insane nades are way too op common and easy to use stuns are useless unless you get lucky ak recoil is way too much The game is also centered around luck and sometimes aim and gamesense If you get lucky then you are bound to win the game The starting zones basically chooses who is going to win and are most of the time miles away from where you start Also why is there the scar and the m4 There only needs to be one as they are basically the same guns The game is also not very beginner friendly as they do not know all the controls and how things work Bullet velocity is also really buggy as bullets are 1700mph in the real world and running in the game is around 5 10 mph I know the distance is alot to compensate but its always way too much even when someone is very close to you you have to aim alot in front of them the same with cars
Game crashed logged back in to find out that someone had killed me too 010 feelsgoodman
Spent 5 minutes looting all of Mil and my bike got wedged into a fence and exploded instantly before showing any signs of damageVery next game bad module error 1010 game would not spend actual money on it again just waiting for the first decently coded BR to come out so i can leave this behind for good
Trash game much hack
This game is awesome the map is large and jumping from the plane at the begining lets you land either by yourself or go hard straight into the action Having the play area shinrk makes you have to run hard or get a car This gets your heart pumping having to push harder to the circle knowing that people could be anywhere GL HF
FIX THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING LAG Its nearly unplayable and I have a pretty damn good machine Its not the best but I m running 40 GhZ with 16 GB of RAM and a GTX 1050 Ti Gaming edition it should NOT be lagging as much as it is I love the game hate the LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing lag Fix it
You legit need a i7 to run this game Its not optimized in a single way The devs really need to Optimize this game
Broken piece of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and it s boring The idea of BR is good but this game fails at that Overrated game lol
servers are terrible but its still better then KoTK
1010 would play again unless your a sh tc nt then ya ll quit like the bi ch a s you are
Game is very dull Really is what it says it is and after a few games it isn t worth playing again And you know what s tiring  These developers trying to top off these previous survival games like Rust or Ark for instince Try coming up with something unique and not generic You re not going to please the fanbase let alone new gamers I d wait when it goes on sale for 999 That s all it s really worth
good game but gets very stale over time
lynch the goo ks and slant eyes
H1Z1 PUBG
I want to emphasize that I do not use Game plugin why to be banned   STEAMputs the problem to you you will push the problem to  BE is it not   I bought your game on the  STEAMplatformBut because of the safety of steam my  STEAM account was stolen my  STEAM account was stolenmy  STEAMaccount was stolen It is not easy to get a password my game was banned what mechanism is this    STEAM says  that they have no way to solve the problem the problem is obviously due to the  STEAM caused by my losses they do not issue any evidence in fact you BLUE HOLE have used the anti   cheating mechanism of  BE company You have to give me an explanation  That can it be said that the loss caused by the safety problem of  STEAM is enough How many days have passed My question is Influence not just for myself  and it is expected to attract attention  I also stressed that I hate to affect the game fair behavior But is it fair to be sealed off for no reason 
GOOD fun with friends
Meh Gets boring very fast No reason to play except for crappy item boxes It seems that it will take an eternity to have a second map Has potential but isn t going places  for now
You can spend hundreds of hours in this game and never get bored
Very poorly optimized I have a pretty good pc  not high end but not bad either and this game goes from 60 fps to less than 20 in some areas later in the match Also server lag Probably gonna recommend it once it is out of early access and is playable for people who don t have 10k PCs
Worst opimization ever  Game getting worse and worse New Updates made it unplayable unless you have 1000 computer Still bad
its pretty good pls update hit reg and d sync
Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is awesome It is a lot of fun to play with friends and a good way to meet other gamers as well I really like the teamwork aspect when you are in a squad or doing Duo If you haven t tried it you should 1110 rating from me
Melhor jogo de todos os tempos na moral melhor battleroayle por enquanto porem possui muitos bugs n atualiados ainda mas como jogo nao esta completo  aceitavel
Honestly best game I have played in a long time Play it almost everyday sucks people get banned for dumb reasons but doesnt affect me Gameplay is 1010 Highly would suggest trying it out
it is a very funny and addicting game
Changing my review of this game  as expected I now recommend it to the general FPS community PUBG has become an acceptable title that brings the superior  battle royale  experience Keep in mind the below accomodations and complaints are generally opinionated and only reflect what I like in shooters  I am a more tactical shooter personWhat I EnjoyFirstly the rush you get in those last circles is amazing You feel your arteries pump in your throat and wrists as the player count decreases It is a feeling that is only comperable to some of the greatest horror games where the rush hinges on well constructed suspense rather than cheesy jump scares that bore you by the end I am talking palm sweaty  mom s spaghettiSecond the performance of most of the weapons is great They use fairly consistent  spray patterns  that allow for a higher skill ceiling in close quarters combat like the ones you see in games like Rainbow Six  Seige and Counter Strike The ballistics are decent with travel time and bullet drop allowing for an even higher skill ceilingThird the improved optimization has allowed for my friends with medium rigs to run this game acceptably on medium settings This was necessary for any positive review I would give and I am glad they have improved thisAnd lastly team gameplay is a blast Coordinating with a friend or three is so much fun and this game really offers a great teamplay experience If you buy this game with one to three friends you certainly will not be disappointedWhat I Don t Like  NitpickingThe Blue Circle damage is too low Time and time again I get killed from the back by someone who spent extra time outside the play area thus getting all of my gear and all he had to do was use one first aid kit which I probably had plenty ofSpeaking of the Blue Circle it is still too RNG based I have heard rumors that there is actual code in the game that forces the Blue Circle to generally favor the middle and yet it is not being used I frequently lose 1v1s because I have to go across the play area to get into the new zone exposing myself to the other player who  happened  to get lucky and get the zone right on top of himDespite what I said about weapon performance there are a couple issues I have like how aimpunch still exists About 25 minutes before writing this review I got into a 1v1 and we had a nice aim duel It was heated and a close fight when   all of a sudden   my screen jolts as I peak out and attempt to return fire I had a level 2 helmet and level 3 vest This is a rediculous effect that lowers the skill ceiling a little and leaves players like myself very saltyAnother problem I have is shoulder fire is stupidly inaccurate I play a lot of tactical shooters and there they understand that few games actually depict their characters holding weapons at the hip and the same goes for PUBG Guns stay mounted on the shoulder while firing and yet the moment I dont tilt my head down to take aim my bullets fly wildly everywhere especially while moving This is not helped by the drastically reduced FOV and high zoom while using ADS even without a scope It is absolutely unreasonable and it makes CQB way too RNG for my enjoymentMy final complaint I will add is the lack of a filter for weather Fog can be fun and I have had some great games in it but fog  FOR ME is generally unenjoyable It is a little frustrating when myself and my squad have to leave a game due to fog when we could just have a filter that removes the possibility of it occuring  NOTE  I ONLY PLAY FIRST PERSON I CAN NO LONGER SPEAK FOR THE THIRD PERSON GAMEPLAY  This game is an excellent 30 provided you know what you are getting yourself into There are some parts missing like a trainingtutorial and more bonus gamemodes that would complete the game but as of right now I rate this game 8210Please make sure to comment your thoughts and mark this review as helpful or not helpful depending on what you thought of it OBJECTIVELY so that   if it is good   it can be seen by more consumers
It s game
its just gta only with more mayhem its up to you if u want to face threat and not be a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  or play it like its a walking simulator besides theres no losing here or sense of progress just pure adrenaline packed fun
IS an awesome game but this last month the Aimbot cheating is running rampant done playing till it gets cleaned up
Played this game for a while now its a decent game I ve noticed more than a few times that i didnt recive any BP after a match kinda ruins the fun when im trying to save for a crate and have to play 3 or 4 matches when i should had have enough after the first on
I loved this game for a great portion of the time I have on it I stopped playing this game because of how long it took to get into a new game after you died the map sizes are in fact too large the physics are inconsistent and unreliable whether it be in a car parachuting or shooting in general looting is quite poor seeing as how you can go to 6 house town and only get a shotgun and some lvl 1 gear with a gay shirt and some pistol attatchments I enjoyed the game fully before the 10 release then they stopped updating it as frequently and they made two  major  updates since When i know for a fact it was having larger updates more frequently PUBG was ahead of the competition then the competition met the bar that was PUBG then pubg released lagged behind and the competition took over  loud gay cough  fortnite One weekend I just couldn t bring myself to play pubg anymore and i switched to the alternative fortnite Back to the map thing they are making a smaller map now with the loot drops that happen on the big map going to this small map the gameplay will be even worse I loved this game and i prayed it wouln t become H1 or DayZ but as of i right now i believe in 3 months this game will be free Bring backt the early release baby don t buy this game 310 Download fortnite because your friends are probably playing that and not this 40 FPS single ply poops after they shower LOVE LOVE LOVE  game
Hell yahh 
cheeki breeki
Good fun game and was a little hard to learn luckily I had a friend to help me learn so try and find a friend to help you and yea also with friends makes game a lot more fun
I ve played this game a ton It is an excellent concept with lots of potention However the developers see how popular it has become and think that they are done and have the next competitive ESports game They don t This game is so poorly optimized you have to have a stellar PC just to run it and even then you could have all settings on low and only get MAYBE 60 fps And even when you have high frames it is still extremely stuttery and not smooth at all Also when in firefights it is basically up in the air whether you will win or not There are so many terrible mechanics and because it runs so poorly you could shoot someone several times and they ll just turn around a kill you in one hit This game is just full of problems and it is very frustrating considering the potential it has and the fact that the devs are just travelling around showing their poorly made unfinished game off and spending more of their time and resources on developing new things like a terrible fog weather setting and trying to get it on the Xbox rather than spending the millions they have made and their whole studio to actually fix the game
Game need optimizationReally bad my 1050ti has troubles running thisn game
The game itself is amazing for being Early AccessUnfortunately the servers can t keep up and the dev team is banning players for  stream sniping  due to poor sportsmanship of Streamers Game  1010Server  510Dev Team  010   October 25th 2017   Dev team has addressed complaints from the above this review is still negative for the time being Still remains one to puchase for your library though They are planning on adding new maps and optimizing graphics for better framerate 5 points to the dev team Total score  2030
If ur in a small country like New Zealand it wont work Don t get the beta
AS SEA NA EU Ranking the first to the third are all cheatingThis is god s war
its all good but some bugs and when ya pick up stuff it takes ages
let me start off by saying i love this game But banning people for honking at and killing streamers is DISGUSTING and bluehole should be ashamed
I originally had a positive review for this game and i had a lot of fun playing it a few months ago but the lack of banning of players and the developer calling us xenophobic for wanting locked region servers because its literley impossible to play a  team based  game when your teamate doesnt speak the same language as you has led me to leave a negitive review Great game Terrible anti cheat protocol and even worse developersDevelopers just care about making money so if your  group  of people dont contribute to them making money dont expect to have your problems fixed
I started scanning hillsides for prone players irl
LOL i cant playRunning but not launchingi have all redistributed file  MS C 2005   2017 and net frame work 451Help MTF
I could easily get excited when I kill some players and even survivebut some technology problems really disturb meI hope that one day it could get better and it won t be destroyed by Tecent
Sterotypical average FPS game that is going to create multiple clones for many eons unforutnately LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  game design in which the only way to attempt to win a game is by sitting in bushes or hiding behind MaryJane plants Terrible optimization would not buy again 610

Ok look you are going to hate this game You are going to think that Bluehole is actually a front for the Chinese GovernmentYou are going to get killed by hackersBut most of all you are going to have a one good goddam time doing it This game may have it s bugs glitches and there are other battle royale games out there but nothing  yet can match the atmosphere of PUBG I already play this game on the daily and once Savage comes out you can bet I ll be playing it a lot more  810 right now  1010 with region lock
Typical early access garbage awful sound design poorly optimized gun play doesnt work half the time game has hacker issues as well as chinese idle bots 30 price tag
Blue Hole is garbage They would rather spend time on mobile phone versions of this game than fix the problems it has
well if  i could play this game  without crashing  i would love it but when the server issue was skyhigh nobody could not play the game so why should i have it when it does not work for my pc  on dayz  ive have no problem at all and i play it in high graficks tryed to reinstall it but nope nothing nada  even tryed what support  recomanded  but no it wount work its sad but true  pubg worked fine befor the server bull LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   appared for this company  bluehole if those developers think everybody have money for a beastly pc  so no everybody  cant afford  a top notsh  gamer pc so why dose pubg not work on my pc
TLDR If you don t have intel cpu more than 8 gb ram ssd don t bother buying the game cause you won t be able to run it even if you set everything on low But  in case  you do have spec like Mobo  ASUS FORMULA VIIICPU  Intel Core i7 7700KGPU  GeForce TITAN X PascalRAM  HyperX PREDATOR 32GBOS  Windows 10SSD  HyperX Predator M2 2280 960GBEven then you ll expirience stuttering and fps drop below 60 at certain placesNow you say how is that possible i ve red that min system req areOS  64 bit CPU Intel Core i3 4340  AMD FX 6300GPU nVidia GeForce GTX 660 2GB  AMD Radeon HD 7850 2 GBHD Space 30 GB available spaceRAM 6 GB RAMWhich makes you think that i m not telling truth but then no one tells you about memory leaks that after couple of games if you don t restart the game memory usage goes to 14gb And if you have 8 gb  make sure you have iron will and stomach to digest that you gave 30 for a game that you have to restart each time you die or else  network lag detected  will appear and when the lag is gone you are gone with it cause guy who landed after you will have time to loot everything and pan you just for the lulzNot gonna mention that players from  certain countries couldn t even play the game without vpn which was recomended by staff on forums cause otherwise it would dissconnect you before loading  which made game even laggier So yeah buy the game and wait a month till they fix that then wait another month for optimisation but no you get textures update so that it can lag even moreSo yeah best optimised game if blizzard optimised their games like this they wouldn t even existLet s get back to begining of this review if you don t have beast PC or stuff i ve mentioned above don t bother wait till they fix everything or else you ll snap at one point  depending of you crp tollerance Cause at this point it s only idea of a game you can t call this playable gameUpdate 3 4 months passed and while network lag is gone and replaced with stuttering and inablity to move properly which is same thing and numerous game breaking bugs that are not allowing you to compete at same level as others i ve came to conclusion that this game is simply bad  it s nice idea but that s all it is at this point And this is why   You need voicemeeter or some sound program to modify sound or else you are unable to hear footsteps some sounds are way too loud and can damage you hearing Color is grayish black no matter how high you set brightness so again you need to acquire program like reshade to alter colors and blur All this decreases your fps Additionally reshade fills up ram even faster so you have restart every 2 3 games  don t bother if you have 8gb ram  Three floor bulding and no AR just gun   Loot spawning system causing additinal lag because it doesn t pre spawn like in some other battle royal games that came after pubg   Lots of times you end up fiding 4 5  of same weapon spawned in building complex  More you invest in your pc more advantage you have over other players because this game is optimised same as cheap adult game made in unity
PubG is an insane Ultimate Life Or Death Expierencei can t wait untill more maps   vehicles come out insanely fun co op expierenceWinner Winner Chicken Dinner DxSensei gives 910
I m left with mixed feelings after playing this game for a whileTo start with the 10 release did not improve the performance I still can t play it on my PC I had some expectations for the full release and it didn t meet most of themRegarding gameplay I think the most annoying thing in this game is trying to figure out where shots are coming from I think the audio needs improvement in this case although you can tell where the shooter is if he is close at greater distances you can t rely on the sound anymoreI also don t like that you can t decide the map you want to play on the game does that for you I think there s a 50 50 chance regardless I want the option to play on the map I preferI also want to have my own private games and I can t see why it s too much to ask Wanna practice  Wanna improve your shots  Yeah tough luck because you have to be some kind of content creator to have your own custom games I really hope they make it available to everyone because it really feels like I m being denied basic features a game like this should have because I m not a god damned content creator I want to warm up before my games I want to practice I want to experiment I WANT BASIC GAME FEATURES THAT FREE GAMES OFFER AT THIS POINTThis game made a lot of money like A LOT of money I can t see why it s not doing so well in terms of completing the game invest in some developers I don t understand how hard it can be
PUBG is one of the greatest games at the moment currently and I love the game and will keep playing it however it s very hard to play the game when their servers are literally hooked up to McDonalds free wifi Fix these goddamn servers please I m literally going insane Until then my review is negative
blueass entertainment
streamers
I think so This game is always changing its bag It will be stuck at 10 o clock on time at night That really stopped us from having a good time
A game that had alot of potential but also alot of game breaking flaws The studio decided to sue Epic Games for the release of fortnite because the game is more popular than PUBG now That s just dumb in so many ways Read online about the subject The company that makes PUBG is full of jerks Don t spend your money on this game
PAX East 2018 sealed the deal for me to DELETE this game from my PC  Waited 2 hours in line to play the new Warzone mode FINALLY Sat down with my 4 buddies ready to kick some butt and the dev s  booth workers changed the game mode so that 98  out of the 100 who just sat down were turned to Zombies and were tasked with hunting 2 twitch Streamers who sat down with us  The game mode was changed to benefit the 2 streamers and screw the 98 of us who wanted to try the new mode    WHAT A WASTE   When we brought it up to the booth workers we received a lazy shrug and careless  sorry         PAX EAST was a fantastic way for this group to show who they REALLY care about aka streamers Not your average player    I have DELETED THIS GAME and will make sure this is constantly brought up when I can This was added to the PUBG official Twitter page too on Friday of PAX East 2018
I hate this game don t spend 30 dollars on it Go play Fortnite or Minecraft it s better
This game is the best competitive game I have play and I love it and I know a lot of haters out there hating the game for one reason the glitches the new update just came out give them sometime to fix soething
Much better than any game I played as a console pleb
As a South African Gamer with a minimum of 220ms ping to the closet server  EU  They removed the ability to bind crouchjump to the same button which hampers us with a higher ping to succesfully crouch jump since you have to be milisecond specific causing us to get trapped in rooms and easily killed   since we cannot leap out of windows anymore  Ads  Idea stolen from a book of the 90 s   movie with the name of BattleRoyal but  looking at legal action  against another game developer whoms Engine they use  Takes about 10 minutes to start one game because someone in the squad always have to refresh his GUI before it can start   Devs make changes to the game without consulting the community and merely rely on input of streamers whom are horrible gamers   Trying to make an arcade game too realistic removing loot  Why even have clothes spawn in game 
why PUBG not working in my computer  
I enjoy the game but HYPE TRAIN DOWN YA GO
Is a excelent game but over 30  of ther players is using hacker so don t buy it Stop wasting your money cause BlueHole is not even trying to fix this they are just making more stuffs to give them money Sad but true
Pan OP
Good game terrible devs

Great game even more fun with friends

I come from a galaxy far far far away Landed on this primal planet and the monkeys here have taught me the way of computer gaming Into my hairy hands a game has fallen named PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUND that I of course have given monkey coins to buy it Thus and after a lot of experience my intergalactic intellect have led me to believe that I m indeed on a monkey planet and althought the game developers have earned a vast amount of monkey money their undeveloped brain can t focus on making this masterpiece of a game better On the contrary these speciment seem to focus on spectator bugs and streamer issues like  stream sniping  instead of game stability and new features            EDIT  15112017   All seriously developers have taken feedback and they seem to try right now The review above is canceled Thumbs up from me

PIECE OF   S H I TTOTAL GARBAGEOVERRATED     B U L L S H I T
Wut  5 hours and cannot play this LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  anymore 
I think this game is amazing and fun Yes it does tend to get repetitive simply because it only has one map to play on but the adrenaline from having to stay alive is so intense and enjoyable Even when you have a team to play with it is still amazing I am glad they added the whole  reported  aspect but the only downside is there are still cheaters and you can tell Especially when your whole team is lighting up the same guy and he still doesn t go down but yet manages to wipe us all out All in all I would give this game a 1010 but for now it gets a 810 until we can get a new map and get rid of all the cheaters
Human Nature Sim 2017
Please fix the servers
Fun if i could playTakes too much RAM and game has been crashing every match   
This game is an early access garbage fire
Nah save your money for something more deserving
good game devs are gayBlue Hole studios more like Butt Hole studios
Love this game Very fun gameplay Servers a little laggy but i wont put it against them cuz they host 100 people in each match so its not easy Great game and is only getting better with every patch
Poorest excuse for a full release game i ve seen extremely buggy constant crashes seems like it gets worse with every patch
Great game but they put ads in the people connecting from China and bought the biggest VPN provider in China and pretty much making all players connecting from China to use THEIR vpn Also they are banning a lot of players for  Stream Sniping  when people dont even have twitch accounts Great Game Cannot recommend to ANYONE with the direction the devs are sh ting on their playerbase
This game is great but I can t recommend it until they Fix performance issuesShow some love to other regions like OCE with a slow FPP mode and china with their IN GAME adsStream sniper issue  not experienced this myself but i ve heard alot of people complaining about itDid I mention performance issues  that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  bad btw Edit Game is now well optimized cant comment on the issues for china and OCE but on EUW everything is solid
Connection failed every night for OC server What s wrong with BLUEHOLE I think u GUYS can use  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   instead of  BLUEHOLE AMD R7 1700XGTX1070SSD 256GY I ONLY GOT 70 FPS ON 1920 1080 NICE GAME MATEVERY NICEHACKING EVERYWHERE can u explain to me why 
Good Game just needs fixing Iv played Halo 4 for years and never had an issue with aiming This game makes it so Freaking annoying on aiming and hitting people in far distences where the crosshair is aimed is where the bullet should go Dont get me wrong I love playing this game just somethings need to be fixed  Other things should be added like a radar since you want the game area to shrink better looting system because half the places on the map have crap for loot in the game most places iv landed ether had nothing in them or 5 9 of the same freaking item like for example  Pan  or   bullets but no gun around  Add C4 and Claymores to the game to see how that would even the odds have other game modes like deathmatches in small areas to where you can have  capture the flag  or  king of the hill  matches because as big as the map you have going there is room to make other game modes I think this would make the game even more populerIv played many games for a long time and yes most would love some changes as long as its not  Nurffing the game  The hackers of the gaming world rune the games anyways I see the hacker problem head on and have had them in games played and i know how others feel the one thing is you programed the game and you know how many bullets it takes to kill the player with or without a vest or helmet so the system would check both players for anomalies if it detects the players getting killed faster than the rate you know for the gun used it automaticaly kicks the player responsable for the action that took place and offers the user a one time auto respond The same as you know what guns can Head shot kill them the only ones that would put a negitive mark on the post more than likely are hackers them selfs because they know its true alls the hack does is inprove the bullet and modifys the damge it gives one thing the battler eye will never understand the auto aim hack is a joke its taking a aiming fichier called auto aim that most lazy people use so they dont have to try at the game witch Battle eye would not detect because its just adding a fichier to the user only or since the server holds all the info it adds it to that usres info Why a hacker is so gun hard on cheating the world will never know to me its just a looser that sucks at video games because they dont have the balls to learn the game its like yay I did it know i can be number one but nope your just a cheat that hacked there ways to the top good for you when your so board because no challeng to the game and you realize You Just Suck at the game You have to hide in your dark room and cant share with others wile other real gammers still have you beat and laughing with there friends as you set there all alone
Cool ads bro
I think it s really cool I like it a lotMaybe we can hang out or something
I thought EA servers were bad but thisOther than that the game is pretty good
HACKERS ARE EVERYWHERE the solo leaderboard top ten are all hackers been killed three times today by hackers they are getting very bad cant recommend with the current number of hackers in the game
I have never been a fan of survivor games would just try them for couple of hours max before giving up on them but this game has got me hooked All my gaming time goes into this and trust me it is worth itFrom the moment of forming squad and you start a game to the moment when you are in the top 5The thrill keeps on increasing the nerves start getting to you it s all about how well can you deal with itThe teamwork gamesense awareness and every single thing any other game has ever taught you you will need it hereAnd don t get me started on how rewarding the game is the feeling of surviving at the end and winning or carrying your team to victory no other game has never given me such adrenalineI have had so many moments laughing having fun and a lot more with shaky hands trying to clutch at the end and all of this has been worth it worth more than what I paid forWould buy again 1110
Forget about the negative reviews This game is awesome For a game still in development this game is stuning The visuals are good and the mechanics are good enough for now But the thing is you always get in that tense moment when theres only you and less than 10 people alive Every game ends diferent Theres no way to get bored in this game The beggining is a bit slow and you can die out of nowhere But if you manage to get to the end you will not regret If you want to have some fun every match this is your game The greatest game of hide and seek of all time And now you can get your money back reseling the crates you win in game win win
Literally killed King of the Kill and i hope it continues to crush games in the same genre like Fortnite The game so far has been excellent other than a few bugs here and there which is understandable as the game is still in beta
Esports ready Early AccessChoose oneIts the only game where adding something like a car can break the entire lobby systemHave to play on NA despite living in UK becuase EU servers are so LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  When it works its fun
If you want a game that s run by chinese hackers and developers that don t care Purchase PUBG
Developers are so abusive with permenant bans unless you re a popular streamer they will just ban you for 3 days for business purposesYou might get banned for anything stream sniping killing your teammates talking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  or just if you re too good and they suspect that you cheated lol
This game could be a great game and it has the addictive game flow we all love i use to love to play BUT now it seems that killing a guy is all luck maybe that game u get a good connection to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  server and you kill ppl most the time not all as i am not a god i die from 5ft around a corner one game last week i died inside a building almost all the way up the stairs to a guy outside the building to the left behind a wall 7m in and still on aws cloud servers after they ve made so much off the game they could be on dedicated servers by now or atleast let hosting site get server files so we can buy our own dedicated servers And banning ppl who speack out or are stream snipers ha this is ridiculous you cant even prove this unless its completely obvious on stream Then the rule of conduct are the rule of a high school and u cant enforce them if u did the player base would die and the game would fail every lobby 10 ppl break that with name calling and racism so you game would be deadEDIT Game awesome fun time Server ha do i even need to speak about thisactually yes the hit regdesync is the worst ive ever seen and u want survey of gun balance update ok let me see o 30 rounds scar no bullet count we cant give u feed back on that can we stop pandering to the 1  with fiber internet EASY fix open file for server hosting companies uve made 1b  off game and still with the mincraft servers come bluehole server hosting is free for u company will pay u for the rights to use ur game file to get more buisness   for them and its a win all around for everybodyFanboys Stop with the blind following of the game and when some one calls out a issue its ur system broing them is not how the game gets better fanboys kill everything at this rate pubg will be dead and fanboys and hackers will be all that is leftits not ones system  if ppl had brains y u can dump rounds in ppl and they walk off and u get shot 3 times and die
i love this game its just amazing its better the h1z1
Man this game could be so good I love the way the guns shoot I love the feel of the game but holy LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  Like they couldn t have made a more un optimized game if they tried I have a future proof PC and I only get 90FPS on max 70  of my pals can t even run this game I know the game s only been out for a year but give me a break Oh and the RNG is laughable Like it s by far some of the worst RNG I ve literally ever experienced
PUBG THIS GAME IS GREAT WITH FRIENDS  3Even though i havent played this game a lot recently It is still a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  ton of fun to play with people  
Cons  Worse shooting mechanic than other major FPS titles Camping simulator WalkingRunning simulator Overhyped FPS issues  on my Radeon RX 580 8gb and 6core 35GHz CPU using only medium graphicsPros  Good sound qualtiy Pretty fun to collect guns at the beginning Cool to have so many other people in the same gameI really want to like this game but when I compare it to something like Overwatch it s a steamy pile of LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   I have no idea how this is so popular I don t understand kids todayNOTE    Probably fun with friends but I m such a sinnical LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  that I don t keep them around long enough to play with me
Little efford into fixing performance On AMD CPU it s just crap
Pretty fun but gets boring fast Back to csgo
pls we need midlle east servers pls
Its full of bugs and the servers very slow
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE so bad 
you play 3 games then the servers go offline
this game is focking trash the bugs HAS INCREASED AF AFTER RELEASEleaving early access means 90  less bugs ik there is no perfect games but wtf this game is not anywhere perfect this game is trash PLZ DONT WASTE UR MONEY
Lobby sever Is suck   
the game is goodbut the server connection is very bad
The game is buggy as hell It does not work many time with  errors  appering in the main lobby which looks ridicolus Feels like the developers just drop the first thing in their head and got disparage The customizations in this game is very bad You can literally just buy clothes by buying chests And you won t find there anything good Mostly of time you ll get the same things as you got before so you ll sell them and get less money to save for another lame chest which won t give you anything good again No jewelry no funny movements nothing you ll get because it doesn t exist It has microtations as well which offer you to buy chests which not worth the money They re priceless but worthless The game is laggy as well and it s annoying I hope the company will fix those problems and will add  much but much more content because it s getting boring after 70 hours in the same map with the same guns For now   I m not recommend you to buy this game It has a good gameplay but with less content and with many problems
Great game concept but too many server issues desync and random crashes I run a top tier rig but still experience these issues pretty much constantly Even saw a vid the other day where a guy planted two shotgun headshots on another guy who didnt even have a helmet and the mf didnt go down That s the kinda desync bs happening consatantly I realize this is an aplha release but come on  with the kinda money they made off of this title they should be able to afford some top shelf servers and hire some grade A programmers to try and stabilize this mess And then there s bluehole s ridicolous LOVE LOVE LOVE  kissing of the streamers Banning random people without even investigating the issues That s pretty LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  man I still like the game when it runs smoothly though
1010 would never play again
Please fix your da n server and anti cheating
Loot for 30 minsdie to a camperGGGGGG
We are aware of server connection issues Our engineering team is working on a fix Thank you for your patience
This game is a clusterLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  of issues first of all its poorly optimized there will be start game lag for 99  of all players meaning the 1  that manage to actually play can just get a gun and kill you before you are fully in the gameSecond of all it s an RNG driven LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  should you land somewhere alone and get plenty of loot options there s still a chance you leave 8 houses with 6 lvl 1 vests anda  pistol with 15 bullets and the 1 lucky guy that raided a shack found an sks a level 3 helmet vest and a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing vacation to hawaai with everything paid of course should you get good loot you also need to make sure you are in the circle what s that the circle is on the other side of the island and you can t find a car  well too bad you lost alreadyThe comes the bugsohh the bugs Hit detection is way off you can punch someone 4 times in the back and they might only get hit once but you can be sure the guy running in a straight line towards ou will hit you and 1 shot you no matter how you dodge your automatic weapon might suddenly stop firing through no fault of your own bullet spread is random as hell and seems higher if you weapon is on automataic regardless of how many shots you fire climbing a wall is a task shotguns are next to useless unless you re litterally shoving it up someones LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and firingBut all that could be wrote off as just early development problems it could get fixed and all would be forgiven if just the developer weren t such a money hungry asshat willing to ban anyone killing his popular streamers cause he cares more about sales than the actual people playing his games and should one of his precious streamers call  stream sniping   even though he s the idiot broadcasting his location to everyone you cna be sure said guy is gone within a few hours even if he had no idea who he killed and was actually playing legitAll in all poorly made cashgrab with microtransaction in early development LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  devs and bad optimisation spend your cash on spicy food instead that way you might atleast enjoy it a little before your LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  get s LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed
I ve died more times to a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing bump in the road on a motorbike than I have to actual players1010   Best Game definitely deserves it s spot at the topPS LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  the developers and them going against their  no microtransaction  promise
I have some complians about this game but it is good This is the best battle royale game
Name Age   John 65   Gitte 40   Sussie 19
Squad time
Pros  really good gameplay and fairly stable mechanics Cons  glitches but then again it s in early access I am assuming things will get better as time goes on
If you enjoy PVP shooters you might like this game The lags latency and vehicles need improvement but I love battle royale style games in open world type settings
PUBG is the best pc game of 2017 this game is worth every pennyPS No offense but do not team up with Chinese guys cuz 80  of Chinese players will teamkill you for your loot and they also don t speak English You will find them crawling every server in this game FML
It s all right i suppose
930
Shouldn t have ADs for the game that I already paid And the optimization is really bad
its full of asians
Easily my favorite game on the PC Needs some tweeking but overall solid
Devs too focused on adding cosmetics weapons and maps meanwhile the game has slowly become more and more unplayable Used to run the game just fine maybe the odd frame drop here and there and now the game either crashes or fails to load any buildings
Lag and false bans is all you will find in this game
This game is great It s still in early access and people don t understand that It will get better and sure it s unoptimized but  so far i m impressed
i like the game but i wish they would release it from beta already considering how many people have bought the game so far just being as is in beta thing s to add to the gamebetter hit markers or blood splatter when you hit someone more diversity in weapon s more people in squads and last but not least a better anti cheat program to get rid of hacker sthey re problematic and growing
Server down on a Monday morning Also its buggy as hell Laggy as sh t in city with placeholder assets
server got problemalways can t login
Fantastic dev team great gunplay super fun This game has it all and is only improving All these negative reviews are of people complaining about Chinese servers which isquestionable So if you aren t in China you should be good to go to pick this up for your next addiction
I think of this game as angry birds I know its an odd comparison but the more i think about it the more it makes sense Angry Birds was a cult phenomenon as is this game but we know that being popular doesn t make a game bad so why the bad review  well think back to angry birds you luanch birds at pigs with a big slingshot and in batllegrounds you get guns and have to fight to be the last one standing These are both very simple lets face it basic ideas yet addicting concepts Many of us have shot thousands of angry birds and many of us have shot many angry players in other words weve all played these games a lot due to their addicting natures battlegrounds is still at its enormous peak whereas angry birds is now a blown over mobile game and i hope that means we can agree that angry birds wasn t groundbreaking and it wasnt the next brilliant idea it was just a guy who got lucky with a decent idea and the game snowballed into a huge franchise through its own popularity If you can throw yourself into a time machine and go forward 6 years from now looking back on this game will you be able to say that this really is a good game or is just another Angry Birds 
Instead of optimizing the server the built in ad only specifies the network accelerator Want money crazy  It s just the most junk game I ve ever seen and the game maker s own problem is not solved allowing players to spend extra money to solve their problems The official apologized for the server problem Emmm that sounds sincere As a result apologize every day the server is still the same there is no change at all Since they feel that players can spend money on a network accelerator they can solve the problem Why don t the game makers pay for themselves  Didn t I spend 30 on game maintenance 
I think the game is great But i also think this is the worst optimized game of all times i have a gtx 1060 and i cant play it on ultra wtf And i havent even talked about all the bugs it hasplease dont ruin this great idea
Such a bad game Its honestly trash1 Servers are horrible2 Streamers get sucked off by devs3 all that for a price of 30     Honestly trashDon t get it this game will die like h1z1 I could have bought 2 pizza s from pizzahut then this trash
rubbish server
This is an amazing game and i would really push for people to not be taken in by these petty reviews by people that are not angry with the game but are most likley just abit salty for things they did themselves
gut gut
I can not recommend this game until most of the following items are dealt with   you still need a somewhat beefy machine to run this game at a solid 60 FPS  1080p  there are still many bugs that need to be fixed as of this review  namely stuttering rubber banding and crashing  this game needs a shooting range to practice firing weapons  dropping at school on Erangel is not enough  this game needs ping limits as the player base is tilted towards Chinese players many who use cheats andor teaming strats  as stated above cheating is still somewhat common   ping limiting and region locking MUST BE implementedhttps wwwyoutubecomwatch vwoBcpSURKgcI will edit this review as these items are fixed  if they ever are
Server every day a bomb garbage game the development company earned so much money not to do the game optimization and server as well as face apology every day  Now the game is built in advertising GABE sanctions it and there are too many plug in server the game experience is very poor
I m sh t at this game yet I still keep playing it
I CANT CONNECT GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY111111111111

I love this game so I m gonna recommend it but please bring back the weather my god

PUBG is not updating for mei cannot fix itwhat do i need to do 
Very bad optimization especially after forcing some of the settings in the last patches Will change if it gets better
I wonder why
Probably the most overrated game to date Lacks content months after EA release Daily server problems Oh and the horrible graphics and performance even on a 1080ti But one thing is clear with this game the fan boys cry EA as soon as you point out an issueGuess some people just missed to point of EA Fun for a bit but don t belive the hype  they just want to make money off you
Great game really funt really well put together
Rampant chinese cheaters a region lock needs to be enforced or this will be PUBG s downfall
Runs no different then it did on release
Game is fun with friends but theres zero excuse for this game to run as poorly as it does Oh and quit crying about Fortnite you babies
This game is a real underdog these days Lots of harsh criticism from snobs Still fun as hell to play and has gotten better since early release

Its a solid game
NOTHING LAST FOREVER
I spent 150 dollars on a trench coat that is now over 600 at the time of writing this I m so excited to sell it and buy more CSGO itemsHonestly it s a fun game to play with friends just make sure your computer won t burn down your house when you try to run it
PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDSThe best Battle Royale Game  I have ever played Sometimes the physics are very wierd but I think that they will fix it soon So Boys and Girls buy fckn PUBG Its worth it
great game just needs a little more work and it does not load most of the time for me the battleye is all wonky
pretty cool bro
Slow clunky buggy poorly optimized Your success is mostly determined by RNG Vast majority of your  gameplay  will be pressing w down for 10 minutes straight to get inside the circle    Go play Fortnite instead  runs like a dream colorful fast paced fun smaller more interesting map
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE   
new map is LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  pateto

The game are present is poxxed by persistent server problems and unacceptable business practices I would avoid purchasing it until these have been resolved
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  devs
Region lock will be mandatory  before I play this game again Every single game starts with a chorus of  China numma waaa  letting you know that everyone you try to kill will not actually be where you think they are leading people to dissapear before your 20 ping eyes Also by having crates and allowing the pieces to be sold on stream they encourage this sort of behavior because there is now a real world financial motive to win games at any cost After about two weeks of play and having a number of situations where I fed 5 blood splattering bullets into the heads of my enemies only to have them turn around and put a single m4 round round intome and kill me  I m wishing I could get my money back
Scrolling through reviewsReviewer  THIS GAME LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SUCKS    DownvotesReviewer has 100   1000 hours totalHm fair enoughChecks reviewers profileCurrently In Game PLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDSHuhMust hate the game so much they can t quit it I guess
I like killing black people
BETTER THAN BEFORE         U MAKE ME HAPPY I MAKE U HAPPY
Could not write review  Servers are to busy
Server of this game is always too busy
The servers are giving constant issues and there are no servers in my country I cant seem to understand how this game is so big and has such LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  servers
I will say this This game is fun and has the potential to continue to be fun Matches with friends are fun and can be quite rewarding Its also a great way to just talk with your friends while playing since half the time its just running and getting into positionBut there are way too many cheaters and it just takes away all the funGG
Gooddd
If you would like your heart to give in while you are having the most fun you will have in a long time GET THIS DAMN GAME  P
No matter what segments have plugins junk games
Bluehole Chinese Official indulges Chinese famous game streamer  55kai  Lu Benwei with repeated cheating behaviors on Douyu Streaming Platform which makes a extremely immoral example for teenagers and all players and lovers of PUBG We protest against Cheating and Official s ignoranceJustice may be late but it must not be absent55
THIS GAME IS A PEICE OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IT DRAINS YOUR SOUL EVERY SECOND YOU PLAY IT THIS IS NOT A BATTLE ROYALE GAME THIS IS A SHITY LOOTING SIMULATOR THEN IT TURNS TO A DYING SIMULATOR WHEN ALL THE TEAMS AROUND YOU HAVE LEVEL 3 GEAR AND ALL OF THEM ARE SHOOTING YOU INSTEAD OF LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING SHOOTING EACHOTHER AND THAT IS IF YOU SURVIVE THE RUNNING SIMULATOR WHEN THE BLUE CIRCLE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ING MAP
1010 would die while trying to catch the zone again
I watched a lot of Donut Operator playing PUBG and figured I d give it a try  My computer was pretty close to what the requirements were so I figured I d be fine  But then they disabled some graphics features to speed the game up which for me slowed it down greatly so it s entirely unplayable  I thought maybe they d try to fix the performance but it seems like they re doing everything but that  I contacted Steam for a refund and they re no help whatsoever  So now I m stuck with a game I can t play and can t returnIf you don t have the latest gen hardware avoid PUBG
Kool game xD rawr
Fun game challenging as all hell It doesnt get boring because of the circle and drops and they do a good job of keeping it updated Maybe my shot sucks maybe i havent had enough gametime in but i feel like the hit detection could use a little more work
A good gameBut I can t understand how does Bulehole thinkThe server is too bad you can not log in the game at about 10 00 pm ererynight if you live in ChinaAfter the update in 928 you will see an ad when you stay in the start screen waiting your frendsIt s an ad for a network agent serviceI know that in China you need network agent service to play the game but I don t need the game developer tell me thatI think my IQ was affrontedPlease pay your attention to make the server betteror give us some other game contentAnd respect Chinese players
Very Good Game But they need to fix the servers so its more smooth rather than adding updates inproving guns and car sounds IMPROV E THE SERVERS
Addicting  Exhilarating  Need I say more   30 is a bargain  Casual players might have a hard time at first  I would recommend watching streams to get better before jumping in head first  Might be a rough landing
this is my second review on pubg my first was very positive about the game and how it is a better version of h1z1 but the last month or two ive been having lots of server issues and as a result am unable to play the game at all this is quite dissapointing considering its popularity and i would definitly like someone to fix this for me before i had this issue it was a really fun and intense game and would recoomend
Really sad in which this game is heading instead on focusing on improving the game playability  the devs are interested in Banning people  who kill streamers without prof    Its like i need to watch the streams and make sure i don t come near any streamer or i will get BANNED
Really nice game i like the improved graphics i would recommend it to any gamer
The game is broken It can be fun it has its moments but eventually you lose that frantic nervous feeling After running into a building and unloading your gun into someones head and dying because of desync for the 500th time you start to lose interest and don t care anymore Frame drops are also a nightmare the game runs like chunky diarrhea and I m on a 4770k and a gtx 1070 You ll have fun but be deeply disappointed eventually With how slow they are to fix it I can see someone coming along with a game that outright replaces this turd soon
Like minecraft with gunsI hate this game
So this is Playerunknown s Battlegrounds  PUBG Even though this game is in Alpha it feels more complete than other games that have been released as a full version The Developers are constantly updating this working on new features and are trying to get rid of bugsSpeaking of bugs This game has the habit to annoy you while you are gathering a team to get the game started Very often you have to reload your game and the status of players is not shown correctly  Has he clicked ready or not Let me say a few words about the game 1 The game is a fast paced  or slow in case you are up against 96 99 campers multiplayer survival game In it s core the game wants you to constantly move and forces fights vs other players There can only be one  or four winner s You start with up to 99 enemies if the lobby is full2 The map is great the landscape feels authentic and provides various locations to hide fight and of course loot The conditions you are fighting in in terms of weather can be sunny rainy or misty I believe nighttime and nightvision goggles as loot would be a great addition however some players leave the game lobby if it is raining for misty There will be new maps and I can t wait to play in the sand3 The loot that you can find ranges from normal clothing over weapons to grenades The spawnsystem tries to place the loot at random locations so that sometimes you are fully geared within 2 minutes and other times you have a pan only That is okay given the fact that you can go out seeking for more loot or hit someone with your pan grab his stuff etc  You are probably dead before that or a lucky chap4 That blue hole circly thingy After being thrown out of the plane and parachuting down to the island you will get notified that you now have a certain amount of time to get into the circle Sometimes you are in sometimes you ll have to cross the entire island to get into it It is randomPUBG can be a quick distraction if you want to play and have some action before you hop on to something else  Quick sometimes equals 4 6 hours The real PUBG feeling starts kicking in when you are not alone You can join or fill a random squad but that often results in them letting you loot just to abuse you as their mule and then killing you for the loot Do not think it is always that way but it happens more  often than I would like I believe the Devs need to add a Voice system to the starting screen paired with the ability to get into a squad before going in That way you know with whom you are going to be in a full squad If you have not bought the game so far I can assure you it is okay You can buy it It is fun There is loads of work to be done but even that does not make the game feel uncomplete
PUBG server crashes daily crappy gaming experience

Dony buy
My heart rate in this game goes quicker than it does in a horror game Every match is one long panic attack and I love it
it no gud
The LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Just saying This had great potential until China ruined it like they do nearly every game they plaguelike seriouslythe desync on it is awful like the devs at bluehole absolute garbage Took me 200 hours of playing to realize this trash game is terrible for solos and its impossible to match with a decent random duo PlayerUnknown said he wants to release this by the end of the year never happening This is the next H1Z1 wait for the next game with good potential forget this crap
Players Unknowns BattlegroundsI played about 170h and still dont know how I abbreviate thisFor Now on lets call it PlayersWell first the game engine is like Arma 2 DayZ which results in performance issues performance issues performance issuesIts driving me insane that this game doesnt look like BF4 but runs with 50fpsProblem is everything runs squishy and vague therefore the competition is not between player skill but rather the PC components itselfSo if you have a  1000 PC its really fun to playThe Gameplay allows diversity everytime you start and encourage you to play another round after you looseAll in all great game I rate 810 and its definitely worth the 25 bucks if you like survival combat shooter and lootingI hope it will hit ist final release in about  1 year and didnt get LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ed up like rust or soPS  props for the Players Unknown Team for keeping the game alive with new content updates
I love the game but is anyone else experiencing game crashes every time they start their game ever since the newest update 
game fun af   it be litty
Too many people the server can not enter every night
A GUY FROM SKY KILLED ME LITERALLY HE WAS FLYING AND KILLED ABOUT 30 PEOPLE BEFORE ME I THINK HE WAS GOD WAIT NO HE WAS CHEATING FIX THIS GAME
The amount of times I ve been lucky one shotted makes me want to one shot playerunkown
wuwuw
Great Game I love it and I hope new maps come out
Great game Best battle royale game yet
It is a great joy to play this gameHowever the players in ChINA have to pay more money to get accelerating while playing in oversea serviceIt is not just a joke to sayPUBG s down payment is 98 while the mouthly mortgage payment is 30In the recent update we can see a officially recommended accelerating app forAS service I am afraid that the official  developer team has got some agreement with the related companyI mean the hope that  the Chinese player can easily play this game without  such aweful  app is rareWhat a pity
refunded LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Havent had a single issue with this game that anyone else might have had just glad they stopped saying China number one
A good game but LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ing buggy as LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  and with micro transactions in early access on a side note Bluehole dont copy a 17 year old concept then complain when others do it better than you
The hype was true Great fast paced strategical shooter game we ve seen for a while Since it is in Early Access please do not get yourself into a crying fit if you see some random unfair deaths like falling off a vehicle and dying The path of success for this game is huge Optimization for various GPU s out there and taking care of the glitches and bugs is all I have to request 100  would recommendProfile badges with number of Chicken Dinners won on player profiles maybe  Keep it up  y
PlayerUnknown is still not fully optimized but its still a good game as it s still in the BETA i believe after the BETA it ll be better Really good game Winner winner chicken dinner guys
F  k up ur pinglag and pack losingcan u make ur f  king server better Can u think something about ur players but NOT on ur f  king money Can u make ur Battle eye better Can ur worker not EATING S  H  I  T Can u see the board in NAAS The TOP 10 are almost ALL HACKERs they even writing their QQ Group With ChineseWG means HACKERCan U uNDERsTAND F  k U
Don t even waste 30 on this crap completely crap developers dont give a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  on this game servers are laggy af About loot  well if you are not streaming don t even try to play it cuz u wont get any loot go check some random streamers on twitch they are getting Scar or AKM on every freaking corner what random players get     a crowbar and thats it so yeah LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  this game don t even waste money of this crap
JUST TOPPP
all the in game stuff is pretty expensive so play for those crates to get the big money and get those promotional crates or whatever i got 20 bux from the twitch one and if i didn t open it I could ve sold it for 100 dollars
All hackers garbage gameshackers just like Star Wars Dark Warrior
So people spill blue blood now  Turns out only certain asian players would have this problem The solution is to not use Chinese as game language Makes me wonder if there are other regions suffering this same problem The subpar performance i can at least try to ignore but as long as they allow themselves to be the censorship s bit ch they can kiss my money goodbye Refunded
This game is the best game ever once you play it you will start to understand the phyisics and you will LOVE it I definetly recommend PLAYER UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUNDS When you have that adreniline pumping you feel so good that you want to keep playing if you dont win keep trying becasue it is coming for you On you got that last circle and they have to run to you YOUR IN LUCK PLAYER UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUNDS should be recommended by everyone ITS THE BEST
very addictive game
May seem difficult to play at first overtime you will get use to being one tappedshotgunned a mile a waydie by drifting your carnot sticking the landing when parachuting on tall buildingsPan blocking bulletsCar glitching through buildings or even falling through the mapbikes performing a 250 meter tall jump while going at 100km over a 5 cm tall curbguns decides not to be picked up and rather watch you panic pressing fe while being shot at a responsible gun WHICH decided to be picked up many more commentsmany more 300 magnum rounds please
If you like buggy maps virgin neckbeards a LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ton of campers and LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  optimization then this game is for you410 will never play again
Really horrible experience The connection service is awful In just one month I have experienced over 4 times of connection cloed  each time kept me waiting for such a long time Honestly for this early access version really not recommend to fully into this game I warn ya
Ya Yeet
good sheety
Fun game Good developers Still needs a lot of work to fix bugs I wish they would remove some of the RNG stuff but it s still skill based enough to be interesting They need to remove red zones make the circles move a little slower and move more of the code execution to server side instead of client side but overall a good game
is Game is Amazing but you have to add alot of things like Deathmatch  zombies the problems   Jumps and other bugs And i dont find a good Loot its okay this is the best game in the World 
If you r ok with fact that this game should be called Cancerunknown s RNGround buy it if not spare yourself
This game is so stupid unbelievable I don t know why I keep playing this trashThe servers are so laggy and its tickrate is similar to games from the early 2000sThis means you will very likely die behind cover because the enemy is still able to see you or you shot people and they won t die because you pulled the trigger  in the wrong second The developers made sooooo much money and yet all they do is implement more microtransactionsloot boxesDO NOT BUY THIS GAMEIt sucks and its developers are greedy busines LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE s who do only look for new ways of pulling more money out of your pocket but have no intention of fixing bugsproviding a feasible gaming experience
love this game so much i bought it on 2 accounts
Very Fun so far
